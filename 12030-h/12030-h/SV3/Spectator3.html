<br>
We <a name="fr4171">may</a> observe, that any single Circumstance of what we have formerly
seen often raises up a whole Scene of Imagery, and awakens <span style="color: #663300;">numberless</span><a href="#f4171"><sup>1</sup></a> Ideas that before slept in the Imagination; such a particular Smell
or Colour is able to fill the Mind, on a sudden, with the Picture of the
Fields or Gardens, where we first met with it, and to bring up into View
all the Variety of Images that once attended it. Our Imagination takes
the Hint, and leads us unexpectedly into Cities or Theatres, Plains or
Meadows. We may further observe, when the Fancy thus reflects on the
Scenes that have past in it formerly, those which were at first pleasant
to behold, appear more so upon Reflection, and that the Memory heightens
the Delightfulness of the Original. A <i>Cartesian</i> would account for
both these Instances in the following Manner.<br>
<br>
The Sett of Ideas, which we received from such a Prospect or Garden,
having entered the Mind at the same time, have a Sett of Traces
belonging to them in the Brain, bordering very near upon one another;
when, therefore, any one of these Ideas arises in the Imagination, and
consequently dispatches a flow of Animal Spirits to its proper Trace,
these Spirits, in the Violence of their Motion, run not only into the
Trace, to which they were more particularly directed, but into several
of those that lie about it: By this means they awaken other Ideas of the
same Sett, which immediately determine a new Dispatch of Spirits, that
in the same manner open other Neighbouring Traces, till at last the
whole Sett of them is blown up, and the whole Prospect or Garden
flourishes in the Imagination. But because the Pleasure we received from
these Places far surmounted, and overcame the little Disagreeableness we
found in them; for this Reason there was at first a wider Passage worn
in the Pleasure Traces, and, on the contrary, so narrow a one in those
which belonged to the disagreeable Ideas, that they were quickly stopt
up, and rendered incapable of receiving any Animal Spirits, and
consequently of exciting any unpleasant Ideas in the Memory.<br>
<br>
It would be in vain to enquire, whether the Power of Imagining Things
strongly proceeds from any greater Perfection in the Soul, or from any
nicer Texture in the Brain of one Man than of another. But this is
certain, that a noble Writer should be born with this Faculty in its
full Strength and Vigour, so as to be able to receive lively Ideas from
outward Objects, to retain them long, and to range them together, upon
Occasion, in such Figures and Representations as are most likely to hit
the Fancy of the Reader. A Poet should take as much Pains in forming his
Imagination, as a Philosopher in cultivating his Understanding. He must
gain a due Relish of the Works of Nature, and be thoroughly conversant
in the various Scenary of a Country Life.<br>
<br>
When he is stored with Country Images, if he would go beyond Pastoral,
and the lower kinds of Poetry, he ought to acquaint himself with the
Pomp and Magnificence of Courts. He should be very <a name="fr4172">well</a> versed in every
thing that is noble and stately in the Productions of Art, whether it
appear in Painting or Statuary, in the great Works of Architecture which
are in their present Glory, or in the Ruins of those <span style="color: #663300;">which</span><a href="#f4172"><sup>2</sup></a>
flourished in former Ages.<br>
<br>
Such Advantages as these help to open a Man's Thoughts, and to enlarge
his Imagination, and will therefore have their Influence on all kinds of
Writing, if the Author knows how to make right use of them. And among
those of the learned Languages who excel in this Talent, the most
perfect in their several kinds, are perhaps <i>Homer</i>, <i>Virgil</i>,
and <i>Ovid</i>. The first strikes the Imagination wonderfully with what
is Great, the second with what is Beautiful, and the last with what is
Strange. Reading the <i>Iliad</i> is like travelling through a Country
uninhabited, where the Fancy is entertained with a thousand Savage
Prospects of vast Desarts, wide uncultivated Marshes, huge Forests,
mis-shapen Rocks and Precipices. On the contrary, the <i>&AElig;neid</i> is
like a well ordered Garden, where it is impossible to find out any Part
unadorned, or to cast our Eyes upon a single Spot, that does not produce
some beautiful Plant or Flower. But when we are in the
<i>Metamorphoses</i>, we are walking on enchanted Ground, and see
nothing but Scenes of Magick lying round us.<br>
<br>
<i>Homer</i> is in his Province, when he is describing a Battel or a
Multitude, a Heroe or a God. <i>Virgil</i> is never better pleased, than
when he is in his <i>Elysium</i>, or copying out an entertaining
Picture. <i>Homer's</i> Epithets generally mark out what is Great,
<i>Virgil's</i> what is Agreeable. Nothing can be more Magnificent than
the Figure <i>Jupiter</i> makes in the first <i>Iliad</i>, no more
Charming than that of Venus in the first <i>&AElig;neid</i>.

<blockquote><img src="images/SG1.gif" width="495" height="72" align="middle" border="1" alt="Greek: Ae, ka&igrave; kyan&eacute;aesin ep' ophrysi neuse Kron&iacute;&ocirc;n,
  Ambr&oacute;siai d' &aacute;ra chaitai eperrh&ocirc;santo &aacute;naktos
  Krat&ograve;s ap' athan&aacute;toio m&eacute;gan d' &eacute;l&eacute;lixen lympos."></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>Dixit et avertens rose&acirc; cervice refulsit:<br>
  Ambrosi&aelig;que com&aelig;; divinum vertice odorem<br>
  Spiravere: Pedes vestis defluxit ad imos:<br>
  Et vera incessu patuit Dea&mdash;</i></blockquote>

<i>Homer's</i> Persons are most of them God-like and Terrible;
<i>Virgil</i> has scarce admitted any into his Poem, who are not
Beautiful, and has taken particular Care to make his Heroe so.

<blockquote><i>&mdash;lumenque juvent&aelig;<br>
  Purpureum, et l&aelig;tos oculis afflavit honores.</i></blockquote>

In a Word, <i>Homer</i> fills his Readers with Sublime Ideas, and, I
believe, has raised the Imagination of all the good Poets that have come
after him. I shall only instance <i>Horace</i>, who immediately takes
Fire at the first Hint of any Passage in the <i>Iliad</i> or
<i>Odyssey</i>, and always rises above himself, when he has <i>Homer</i>
in his View. <i>Virgil</i> has drawn together, into his <i>&AElig;neid</i>,
all the pleasing Scenes his Subject is capable of admitting, and in his
<i>Georgics</i> has given us a Collection of the most delightful
Landskips that can be made out of Fields and Woods, Herds of Cattle, and
Swarms of Bees.<br>
<br>
<i>Ovid</i>, in his <i>Metamorphoses</i>, has shewn us how the
Imagination may be affected by what is Strange. He describes a Miracle
in every Story, and always gives us the Sight of some new Creature at
the end of it. His Art consists chiefly in well-timing his Description,
before the first Shape is quite worn off, and the new one perfectly
finished; so that he every where entertains us with something we never
saw before, and shews Monster after Monster, to the end of the
<i>Metamorphoses</i>.<br>
<br>
If I were to name a Poet that is a perfect Master in all these Arts of
working on the Imagination, I think <i>Milton</i> may pass for one: And
if his <i>Paradise Lost</i> falls short of the <i>&AElig;neid</i> or
<i>Iliad</i> in this respect, it proceeds rather from the Fault of the
Language in which it is written, than from any Defect of Genius in the
Author. So Divine a Poem in <i>English</i>, is like a stately Palace
built of Brick, where one may see Architecture in as great a Perfection
as in one of Marble, tho' the Materials are of a coarser Nature. But to
consider it only as it regards our present Subject: What can be
conceived greater than the Battel of Angels, the Majesty of Messiah, the
Stature and Behaviour of Satan and his Peers? What more beautiful than
<i>Pand&aelig;monium</i>, Paradise, Heaven, Angels, <i>Adam</i> and
<i>Eve</i>? What more strange, than the Creation of the World, the
several Metamorphoses of the fallen Angels, and the surprising
Adventures their Leader meets with in his Search after Paradise? No
other Subject could have furnished a Poet with Scenes so proper to
strike the Imagination, as no other Poet could have painted those Scenes
in more strong and lively Colours.<br>

<br>
Virg.</blockquote><br>
<br>

The Pleasures of these Secondary Views of the Imagination, are of a
wider and more Universal Nature than those it has when joined with
Sight; for not only what is Great, Strange or Beautiful, but any Thing
that is Disagreeable when looked upon, pleases us in an apt Description.
Here, therefore, we must enquire after a new Principle of Pleasure,
which is nothing else but the Action of the Mind, which <i>compares</i>
the Ideas that arise from Words, with the Ideas that arise from the
Objects themselves; and why this Operation of the Mind is attended with
so much Pleasure, we have before considered. For this Reason therefore,
the Description of a Dunghill is pleasing to the Imagination, if the
Image be represented to our Minds by suitable Expressions; tho' perhaps,
this may be more properly called the Pleasure of the Understanding than
of the Fancy, because we are not so much delighted with the Image that
is contained in the Description, as with the Aptness of the Description
to excite the Image.<br>
<br>
But if the Description of what is Little, Common, or Deformed, be
acceptable to the Imagination, the Description of what is Great,
Surprising or Beautiful, is much more so; because here we are not only
delighted with <i>comparing</i> the Representation with the Original,
but are highly pleased with the Original itself. Most Readers, I
believe, are more charmed with <i>Milton's</i> Description of Paradise,
than of Hell; they are both, perhaps, equally perfect in their Kind, but
in the one the Brimstone and Sulphur are not so refreshing to the
Imagination, as the Beds of Flowers and the Wilderness of Sweets in the
other.<br>
<br>
There is yet another Circumstance which recommends a Description more
than all the rest, and that is if it represents to us such Objects as
are apt to raise a secret Ferment in the Mind of the Reader, and to
work, with Violence, upon his Passions. For, in this Case, we are at
once warmed and enlightened, so that the Pleasure becomes more
Universal, and is several ways qualified to entertain us. Thus in
Painting, it is pleasant to look on the Picture of any Face, where the
Resemblance is hit, but the Pleasure increases, if it be the Picture of
a Face that is Beautiful, and is still greater, if the Beauty be
softened with an Air of Melancholy or Sorrow. The two leading Passions
which the more serious Parts of Poetry endeavour to stir up in us, are
Terror and Pity. And here, by the way, one would wonder how it comes to
pass, that such Passions as are very unpleasant at all other times, are
very agreeable when excited by proper Descriptions. It is not strange,
that we should take Delight in such Passions as are apt to produce Hope,
Joy, Admiration, Love, or the like Emotions in us, because they never
rise in the Mind without an inward Pleasure which attends them. But how
comes it to pass, <a name="fr4181">that</a> we should take delight in being terrified or
dejected by a Description, when we find so much Uneasiness in the Fear
or Grief <span style="color: #663300;">which</span><a href="#f4181"><sup>1</sup></a> we receive from any other Occasion?<br>
<br>
If we consider, therefore, the Nature of this Pleasure, we shall find
that it does not arise so properly from the Description of what is
terrible, as from the Reflection we make on our selves at the time of
reading it. When we look on such hideous Objects, we are not a little
pleased to think we are in no Danger of them. We consider them at the
same time, as Dreadful and Harmless; so that the more frightful
Appearance they make, the greater is the Pleasure we receive from the
Sense of our own Safety. In short, we look upon the Terrors of a
Description, with the same Curiosity and Satisfaction that we survey a
dead Monster.

<blockquote>&mdash;<i>Informe cadaver<br>
Protrahitur, nequeunt expleri corda tuendo<br>
Terribiles oculos: vultum, villosaque satis<br>
Pectora semiferi, atque extinctos faucibus ignes</i>.<br><br>

Virg.</blockquote>

It is for the same Reason that we are delighted with the reflecting upon
Dangers that are past, or in looking on a Precipice at a distance, which
would fill us with a different kind of Horror, if we saw it hanging over
our Heads.<br>
<br>
In the like manner, when we read of Torments, Wounds, Deaths, and the
like dismal Accidents, our Pleasure does not flow so properly from the
Grief which <a name="fr4182">such</a> melancholy Descriptions give us, as from the secret
Comparison which we make between our selves and the Person <span style="color: #663300;">who</span><a href="#f4182"><sup>2</sup></a>
suffers. Such Representations teach us to set a just Value upon our own
Condition, and make us prize our good Fortune, which exempts us from the
like Calamities. This is, however, such a kind of Pleasure as we are not
capable of receiving, when we see a Person actually lying under the
Tortures that we meet with in a Description; because in this case, the
Object presses too close upon our Senses, and bears so hard upon us,
that it does not give us Time or Leisure to reflect on our selves. Our
Thoughts are so intent upon the Miseries of the Sufferer, that we cannot
turn them upon our own Happiness. Whereas, on the contrary, we consider
the Misfortunes we read in History or Poetry, either as past, or as
fictitious, so that the Reflection upon our selves rises in us
insensibly, and over-bears the Sorrow we conceive for the Sufferings of
the Afflicted.<br>
<br>
But because the Mind of Man requires something more perfect in Matter,
than what it finds there, and can never meet with any Sight in Nature
which sufficiently answers its highest Ideas of Pleasantness; or, in
other Words, because the Imagination can fancy to it self Things more
Great, Strange, or Beautiful, than the Eye ever saw, and is still
sensible of some Defect in what it has seen; on this account it is the
part of a Poet to humour the Imagination in its own Notions, by mending
and perfecting Nature where he describes a Reality, and by adding
greater Beauties than are put together in Nature, where he describes a
Fiction.<br>

He is not obliged to attend her in the slow Advances which she makes
from one Season to another, or to observe her Conduct, in the successive
Production of Plants and Flowers. He may draw into his Description all
the Beauties of the Spring and Autumn, and make the whole Year
contribute something to render it the more agreeable. His Rose-trees,
Wood-bines, and Jessamines may flower together, and his Beds be cover'd
at the same time with Lillies, Violets, and Amaranths. His Soil is not
restrained to any particular Sett of Plants, but is proper either for
Oaks or Mirtles, and adapts itself to the Products of every Climate.
Oranges may grow wild in it; Myrrh may be met with in every Hedge, and
if he thinks it proper to have a Grove of Spices, he can quickly command
Sun enough to raise it. If all this will not furnish out an agreeable
Scene, he can make several new Species of Flowers, with richer Scents
and higher Colours than any that grow in the Gardens of Nature. His
Consorts of Birds may be as full and harmonious, and his Woods as thick
and gloomy as he pleases. He is at no more Expence in a long Vista, than
a short one, and can as easily throw his Cascades from a Precipice of
half a Mile high, as from one of twenty Yards. He has his Choice of the
Winds, and can turn the Course of his Rivers in all the Variety of
<i>Meanders</i>, that are most delightful to the Reader's Imagination.
In a word, he has the modelling of Nature in his own Hands, and may give
her what Charms he pleases, provided he does not reform her too much,
and run into Absurdities, by endeavouring to excel.<br>

There is a kind of Writing, wherein the Poet quite loses Sight of
Nature, and entertains his Reader's Imagination with the Characters and
Actions of such Persons as have many of them no Existence, but what he
bestows on them. Such are Fairies, Witches, Magicians, Demons, and
departed Spirits. This Mr. <i>Dryden</i> calls <i>the Fairy Way of
Writing</i>, which is, indeed, more difficult than any other that
depends on the Poet's Fancy, because he has no Pattern to follow in it,
and must work altogether out of his own Invention.<br>
<br>
There is a very odd Turn of Thought required for this sort of Writing,
and it is impossible for a Poet to succeed in it, who has not a
particular Cast of Fancy, and an Imagination naturally fruitful and
superstitious. Besides this, he ought to be very well versed in Legends
and Fables, antiquated Romances, and the Traditions of Nurses and old
Women, that he may fall in with our natural Prejudices, and humour those
Notions which we have imbibed in our Infancy. For otherwise he will be
apt to make his Fairies talk like People of his own Species, and not
like other Setts of Beings, who converse with different Objects, and
think in a different Manner from that of Mankind;

<blockquote><i>Sylvis deducti caveant, me Judice, Fauni<br>
  Ne velut innati triviis ac p&oelig;ne forenses<br>
  Aut nimium teneris juvenentur versibus</i><br><br>

<span style="color: #663300;">Hor.</span></blockquote>

I do not say with Mr. <i>Bays</i> in the <i>Rehearsal</i>, that Spirits must not
be confined to speak Sense, but it is certain their Sense ought to be a
little discoloured, that it may seem particular, and proper to the
Person and the Condition of the Speaker.<br>
<br>
These Descriptions raise a pleasing kind of Horrour in the Mind of the
Reader, and amuse his Imagination with the Strangeness and Novelty of
the Persons who are represented in them. They bring up into our Memory
the Stories we have heard in our Childhood, and favour those secret
Terrors and Apprehensions to which the Mind of Man is naturally subject.
We are pleased with surveying the different Habits and Behaviours of
Foreign Countries, how much more must we be delighted and surprised when
we are led, as it were, into a new Creation, and see the Persons and
Manners of another Species? Men of cold Fancies, and Philosophical
Dispositions, object to this kind of Poetry, that it has not Probability
enough to affect the Imagination. But to this it may be answered, that
we are sure, in general, there are many Intellectual Beings in the World
besides our selves, and several Species of Spirits, who are subject to
different Laws and &&oelig;lig;conomies from those of Mankind; when we see,
therefore, any of these represented naturally, we cannot look upon the
Representation as altogether impossible; nay, many are prepossest with
such false Opinions, as dispose them to believe these particular
Delusions; at least, we have all heard so many pleasing Relations in
favour of them, that we do not care for seeing through the Falshood, and
willingly give our selves up to so agreeable an Imposture.<br>
<br>
The Ancients have not much of this Poetry among them, for, indeed,
almost the whole Substance of it owes its Original to the Darkness and
Superstition of later Ages, when pious Frauds were made use of to amuse
Mankind, and frighten them into a Sense of their Duty. Our Forefathers
look'd upon Nature with more Reverence and Horrour, before the World was
enlightened by Learning and Philosophy, and lov'd to astonish themselves
with the Apprehensions of Witchcraft, Prodigies, Charms and
Enchantments. There was not a Village in <i>England</i>, that had not a Ghost
in it, the Church-yards were all haunted, every large Common had a
Circle of Fairies belonging to it, and there was scarce a Shepherd to be
met with who had not seen a Spirit.<br>
<br>
Among all the Poets of this Kind our <i>English</i> are much the best, by
what I have yet seen; whether it be that we abound with more Stories of
this Nature, or that the Genius of our Country is fitter for this sort
of Poetry. For the <i>English</i> are naturally fanciful, and very often
disposed by that Gloominess and Melancholy of Temper, which is so
frequent in our Nation, to many wild Notions and Visions, to which
others are not so liable.<br>
<br>
Among the <i>English</i>, <i>Shakespear</i> has incomparably excelled all others.
That noble Extravagance of Fancy which he had in so great Perfection,
thoroughly qualified him to touch this weak superstitious Part of his
Reader's Imagination; and made him capable of succeeding, where he had
nothing to support him besides the Strength of his own Genius. There is
something so wild and yet so solemn in the Speeches of his Ghosts,
Fairies, Witches and the like Imaginary Persons, that we cannot forbear
thinking them natural, tho' we have no rule by which to judge of them,
and must confess, if there are such Beings in the World, it looks highly
probable that they should talk and act as he has represented them.<br>
<br>
There is another sort of imaginary Beings, that we sometimes meet with
among the Poets, when the Author represents any Passion, Appetite,
Virtue or Vice, under a visible Shape, and makes it a Person or an Actor
in his Poem. Of this Nature are the Descriptions of Hunger and Envy in
<i>Ovid</i>, of Fame in <i>Virgil</i>, and of Sin and Death in <i>Milton</i>. We find a
whole Creation of the like Shadowy Persons in <i>Spencer</i>, who had an
admirable Talent in Representations of this kind. I have discoursed of
these Emblematical Persons in former Papers, and shall therefore only
mention them in this Place. Thus we see how many Ways Poetry addresses
it self to the Imagination, as it has not only the whole Circle of
Nature for its Province, but makes new Worlds of its own, shews us
Persons who are not to be found in Being, and represents even the
Faculties of the Soul, with her several Virtues and Vices, in a sensible
Shape and Character.<br>
<br>
I shall, in my two following Papers, consider in general, how other
kinds of Writing are qualified to please the Imagination, with which I
intend to conclude this Essay.<br>

As the Writers in Poetry and Fiction borrow their several Materials from
outward Objects, and join them together at their own Pleasure, there are
others who are obliged to follow Nature more closely, and to take entire
Scenes out of her. Such are Historians, natural Philosophers,
Travellers, Geographers, and in a Word, all who describe visible Objects
of a real Existence.<br>
<br>
It is the most agreeable Talent of an Historian, to be able to draw up
his Armies and fight his Battels in proper Expressions, to set before
our Eyes the Divisions, Cabals, and Jealousies of great Men, and to lead
us Step by Step into the several Actions and Events of his History. We
love to see the Subject unfolding it self by just Degrees, and breaking
upon us insensibly, that so we may be kept in a pleasing Suspense, and
have time given us to raise our Expectations, and to side with one of
the Parties concerned in the Relation. I confess this shews more the Art
than the Veracity of the Historian, but I am only to speak of him as he
is qualified to please the Imagination. And in this respect <i>Livy</i> has,
perhaps, excelled all who went before him, or have written since his
Time. He describes every thing in so lively a Manner, that his whole
History is an admirable Picture, and touches on such proper
Circumstances in every Story, that his Reader becomes a kind of
Spectator, and feels in himself all the Variety of Passions which are
correspondent to the several Parts of the Relation.<br>
<br>
But among this Sett of Writers there are none who more gratifie and
enlarge the Imagination, than the Authors of the new Philosophy, whether
we consider their Theories of the Earth or Heavens, the Discoveries they
have made by Glasses, or any other of their Contemplations on Nature. We
are not a little pleased to find every green Leaf swarm with Millions of
Animals, that at their largest Growth are not visible to the naked Eye.
There is something very engaging to the Fancy, as well as to our Reason,
in the Treatises of Metals, Minerals, Plants, and Meteors. But when we
survey the whole Earth at once, and the several Planets that lie within
its Neighbourhood, we are filled with a pleasing Astonishment, to see so
many Worlds hanging one above another, and sliding round their Axles in
such an amazing Pomp and Solemnity. If, after this, we contemplate those
wild Fields of <i>&AElig;ther</i>, that reach in Height as far as from <i>Saturn</i> to
the fixt Stars, and run abroad almost to an Infinitude, our Imagination
finds its Capacity filled with so immense a Prospect, and puts it self
upon the Stretch to comprehend it. But if we yet rise higher, and
consider the fixt Stars as so many vast Oceans of Flame, that are each
of them attended with a different Sett of Planets, and still discover
new Firmaments and new Lights that are sunk farther in those
unfathomable Depths of <i>&AElig;ther</i>, so as not to be seen by the strongest of
our Telescopes, we are lost in such a Labyrinth of Suns and Worlds, and
confounded with the Immensity and Magnificence of Nature.<br>
<br>
Nothing is <a name="fr4201">more</a> pleasant to the Fancy, than to enlarge it self by
Degrees, in its Contemplation of the various Proportions <span style="color: #663300;">which</span><a href="#f4201"><sup>1</sup></a> its
several Objects bear to each other, when it compares the Body of Man to
the Bulk of the whole Earth, the Earth to the Circle it describes round
the Sun, that Circle to the Sphere of the fixt Stars, the sphere of the
fixt Stars to the Circuit of the whole Creation, the whole Creation it
self to the infinite Space that is every where diffused about it; or
when the Imagination works downward, and considers the Bulk of a human
Body in respect of an Animal, a <a name="fr4202">hundred</a> times less than a Mite, the
particular Limbs of such an Animal, the different Springs <span style="color: #663300;">which</span><a href="#f4202"><sup>2</sup></a>
actuate the Limbs, the Spirits which set these Springs a going, and the
proportionable Minuteness of these several Parts, before they have
arrived at their full Growth and Perfection. But if, after all this, we
take the least Particle of these Animal Spirits, and consider its
Capacity of being Wrought into a World, that shall contain within those
narrow Dimensions a Heaven and Earth, Stars and Planets, and every
different Species of living Creatures, in the same Analogy and
Proportion they bear to each other in our own Universe; such a
Speculation, by reason of its Nicety, appears ridiculous to those who
have not turned their Thoughts that way, though at the same time it is
founded on no less than the Evidence of a Demonstration. Nay, we might
yet carry it farther, and discover in the smallest Particle of this
little World a new and inexhausted Fund of Matter, capable of being spun
out into another Universe.<br>
<br>
I have dwelt the longer on this Subject, because I think it may shew us
the proper Limits, as well as the Defectiveness of our Imagination; how
it is confined to a very small Quantity of Space, and immediately stopt
in its Operations, when it endeavours to take in any thing that is very
great, or very little. Let a Man try to conceive the different Bulk of
an Animal, which is twenty, from another which is a hundred times less
than a Mite, or to compare, in his Thoughts, a length of a thousand
Diameters of the Earth, with that of a Million, and he will quickly find
that he has no different Measures in his Mind, adjusted to such
extraordinary Degrees of Grandeur or Minuteness. The Understanding,
indeed, opens an infinite Space on every side of us, but the
Imagination, after a few faint Efforts, is immediately at a stand, and
finds her self swallowed up in the Immensity of the Void that surrounds
it: Our Reason can pursue a Particle of Matter through an infinite
Variety of Divisions, but the Fancy soon loses sight of it, and feels in
it self a kind of Chasm, that wants to be filled with Matter of a more
sensible Bulk. We can neither widen, nor contract the Faculty to the
Dimensions of either Extreme. The Object is too big for our Capacity,
when we would comprehend the Circumference of a World, and dwindles into
nothing, when we endeavour after the Idea of an Atome.<br>
<br>
It is possible this defect of Imagination may not be in the Soul it
self, but as it acts in Conjunction with the Body. Perhaps there may not
be room in the Brain for such a variety of Impressions, or the Animal
Spirits may be incapable of figuring them in such a manner, as is
necessary to excite so very large or very minute Ideas. However it be,
we may well suppose that Beings of a higher Nature very much excel us in
this respect, as it is probable the Soul of Man will be infinitely more
perfect hereafter in this Faculty, as well as in all the rest; insomuch
that, perhaps, the Imagination will be able to keep Pace with the
Understanding, and to form in it self distinct Ideas of all the
different Modes and Quantities of Space.<br>

<br>

The Pleasures of the Imagination are not wholly confined to such
particular Authors as are conversant in material Objects, but are often
to be met with among the Polite Masters of Morality, Criticism, and
other Speculations abstracted from Matter, who, tho' they do not
directly treat of the visible Parts of Nature, often draw from them
their Similitudes, Metaphors, and Allegories. By these Allusions a Truth
in the Understanding is as it were reflected by the Imagination; we are
able to see something like Colour and Shape in a Notion, and to discover
a Scheme of Thoughts traced out upon Matter. And here the Mind receives
a great deal of Satisfaction, and has two of its Faculties gratified at
the same time, while the Fancy is busie in copying after the
Understanding, and transcribing Ideas out of the Intellectual World into
the Material.<br>
<br>
The Great Art of a Writer shews it self in the Choice of pleasing
Allusions, which are generally to be taken from the <i>great</i> or
<i>beautiful</i> Works of Art or Nature; for though whatever is New or
Uncommon is apt to delight the Imagination, the chief Design of an
Allusion being to illustrate and explain the Passages of an Author, it
should be always borrowed from what is more known and common, than the
Passages which are to be explained.<br>
<br>
Allegories, when well chosen, are like so many Tracks of Light in a
Discourse, that make every thing about them clear and beautiful. A noble
Metaphor, when it is placed to an Advantage, casts a kind of Glory round
it, and darts a Lustre through a whole Sentence: These different Kinds
of Allusion are but so many different Manners of Similitude, and, that
they may please the Imagination, the Likeness ought to be very exact, or
very agreeable, as we love to see a Picture where the Resemblance is
just, or the Posture and Air graceful. But we often find eminent Writers
very faulty in this respect; great Scholars are apt to fetch their
Comparisons and Allusions from the Sciences in which they are most
conversant, so that a Man may see the Compass of their Learning in a
Treatise on the most indifferent Subject. I have read a Discourse upon
Love, which none but a profound Chymist could understand, and have heard
many a Sermon that should only have been preached before a Congregation
of <i>Cartesians</i>. On the contrary, your Men of Business usually have
recourse to such Instances as are too mean and familiar. They are for
drawing the Reader into a Game of Chess or Tennis, or for leading him
from Shop to Shop, in the Cant of particular Trades and Employments. It
is certain, there may be found an infinite Variety of very agreeable
Allusions in both these kinds, but for the generality, the most
entertaining ones lie in the Works of Nature, which are obvious to all
Capacities, and more delightful than what is to be found in Arts and
Sciences.<br>
<br>
It is this Talent of affecting the Imagination, that gives an
Embellishment to good Sense, and makes one Man's Compositions more
agreeable than another's. It sets off all Writings in general, but is
the very Life and highest Perfection of Poetry: Where it shines in an
Eminent Degree, it has preserved several Poems for many Ages, that have
nothing else to recommend them; and where all the other Beauties are
present, the Work appears dry and insipid, if this single one be
wanting. It has something in it like Creation; It bestows a kind of
Existence, and draws up to the Reader's View several Objects which are
not to be found in Being. It makes Additions to Nature, and gives a
greater Variety to God's Works. In a Word, it is able to beautifie and
adorn the most illustrious Scenes in the Universe, or to fill the Mind
with more glorious Shows and Apparitions, than can be found in any Part
of it.<br>
<br>
We have now discovered the several Originals of those Pleasures that
gratify the Fancy; and here, perhaps, it would not be very difficult to
cast under their proper Heads those contrary Objects, which are apt to
fill it with Distaste and Terrour; for the Imagination is as liable to
Pain as Pleasure. When the Brain is hurt by any Accident, or the Mind
disordered by Dreams or Sickness, the Fancy is over-run with wild dismal
Ideas, and terrified with a thousand hideous Monsters of its own framing.

<blockquote><i>Eumenidum veluti demens videt Agmina Pentheus,<br>
Et solem geminum, et duplices se ostendere Thebas.<br>
Aut Agamemnonius scenis agitatus Orestes,<br>
Armatam facibus matrem et serpentibus atris<br>
Cum videt, ultricesque sedent in limine Dir&aelig;.</i><br><br>

Vir.</blockquote>

There is not a Sight in Nature so mortifying as that of a Distracted
Person, when his Imagination is troubled, and his whole Soul disordered
and confused. <i>Babylon</i> in Ruins is not so melancholy a Spectacle. But
to quit so disagreeable a Subject, I shall only consider, by way of
Conclusion, what an infinite Advantage this Faculty gives an Almighty
Being over the Soul of Man, and how great a measure of Happiness or
Misery we are capable of receiving from the Imagination only.<br>
<br>
We have already seen the Influence that one Man has over the Fancy of
another, and with what Ease he conveys into it a Variety of Imagery; how
great a Power then may we suppose lodged in him, who knows all the ways
of affecting the Imagination, who can infuse what Ideas he pleases, and
fill those Ideas with Terrour and Delight to what Degree he thinks fit?
He can excite Images in the Mind, without the help of Words, and make
Scenes rise up before us and seem present to the Eye without the
Assistance of Bodies or Exterior Objects. He can transport the
Imagination with such beautiful and glorious Visions, as cannot possibly
enter into our present Conceptions, or haunt it with such ghastly
Spectres and Apparitions, as would make us hope for Annihilation, and
think Existence no better than a Curse. In short, he can so exquisitely
ravish or torture the Soul through this single Faculty, as might suffice
to make up the whole Heaven or Hell of any finite Being.<br>

Tull. <i>Epis</i>.</blockquote><br>
<br>
I do not know any thing which gives greater Disturbance to Conversation,
than the false Notion some People have of Raillery. It ought certainly
to be the first Point to be aimed at in Society, to gain the good Will
of those with whom you converse. The Way to that, is to shew you are
well inclined towards them: What then can be more absurd, than to set up
for being extremely sharp and biting, as the Term is, in your
Expressions to your Familiars? A Man who has no good Quality but
Courage, is in a very ill way towards making an agreeable Figure in the
World, because that which he has superior to other People cannot be
exerted, without raising himself an <i>Enemy</i>. Your Gentleman of a
Satyrical Vein is in the like Condition. To say a Thing which perplexes
the Heart of him you speak to, or brings Blushes into his Face, is a
degree of Murder; and it is, I think, an unpardonable Offence to shew a
Man you do not care, whether he is pleased or displeased. But won't you
then take a Jest? Yes: but pray let it be a Jest. It is no Jest to put
me, who am so unhappy as to have an utter Aversion to speaking to more
than one Man at a time, under a Necessity to explain my self in much
Company, and reducing me to Shame and Derision, except I perform what my
Infirmity of Silence disables me to do.<br>
<br>
<i>Callisthenes</i> has great Wit accompanied with that Quality (without
which a Man can have no Wit at all) a Sound Judgment. This Gentleman
rallies the best of any Man I know, for he forms his Ridicule upon a
Circumstance which you are in your Heart not unwilling to grant him, to
wit, that you are Guilty of an Excess in something which is in it self
laudable. He very well understands what you would be, and needs not fear
your Anger for declaring you are a little too much that Thing. The
Generous will bear being reproached as Lavish, and the Valiant, Rash,
without being provoked to Resentment against their Monitor. What has
been said to be a Mark of a good Writer, will fall in with the Character
of a good Companion. The good Writer makes his Reader better pleased
with himself, and the agreeable Man makes his Friends enjoy themselves,
rather than him, while he is in their Company. <i>Callisthenes</i> does this
with inimitable Pleasantry. He whispered a Friend the other Day, so as
to be overheard by a young Officer, who gave Symptoms of Cocking upon
the Company, That Gentleman has very much of the Air of a General
Officer. The Youth immediately put on a Composed Behaviour, and behaved
himself suitably to the Conceptions he believed the Company had of him.
It is to be allowed that <i>Callisthenes</i> will make a Man run into
impertinent Relations, to his own Advantage, and express the
Satisfaction he has in his own dear self till he is very ridiculous, but
in this case the Man is made a Fool by his own Consent, and not exposed
as such whether he will or no. I take it therefore that to make Raillery
agreeable, a Man must either not know he is rallied, or think never the
worse of himself if he sees he is.<br>
<br>
<i>Acetus</i> is of a quite contrary Genius, and is more generally admired
than <i>Callisthenes</i>, but not with Justice. <i>Acetus</i> has no regard to the
Modesty or Weakness of the Person he rallies; but if his Quality or
Humility gives him any Superiority to the Man he would fall upon, he has
no Mercy in making the Onset. He can be pleased to see his best Friend
out of Countenance, while the Laugh is loud in his own Applause. His
Raillery always puts the Company into little Divisions and separate
Interests, while that of <i>Callisthenes</i> cements it, and makes every Man
not only better pleased with himself, but also with all the rest in the
Conversation.<br>
<br>
To rally well, it is absolutely necessary that Kindness must run thro'
all you say, and you must ever preserve the Character of a Friend to
support your Pretensions to be free with a Man. <i>Acetus</i> ought to be
banished human Society, because he raises his Mirth upon giving Pain to
the Person upon whom he is pleasant. Nothing but the Malevolence, which
is too general towards those who excell, could make his Company
tolerated; but they with whom he converses, are sure to see some Man
sacrificed where-ever he is admitted, and all the Credit he has for Wit
is owing to the Gratification it gives to other Men's Ill-nature.<br>
<br>
<i>Minutius</i> has a Wit that conciliates a Man's Love at the same time that
it is exerted against his Faults. He has an Art of keeping the Person he
rallies in Countenance, by insinuating that he himself is guilty of the
same Imperfection. This he does with so much Address, that he seems
rather to bewail himself, than fall upon his Friend.<br>
<br>
It is really monstrous to see how unaccountably it prevails among Men,
to take the Liberty of displeasing each other. One would think sometimes
that the Contention is, who shall be most disagreeable, Allusions to
past Follies, Hints which revive what a Man has a Mind to forget for
ever, and deserves that all the rest of the World should, are commonly
brought forth even in Company of Men of Distinction. They do not thrust
with the Skill of Fencers, but cut up with the Barbarity of Butchers. It
is, methinks, below the Character of Men of Humanity and Good-manners,
to be capable of Mirth while there is any one of the Company in Pain and
Disorder. They who have the true Taste of Conversation, enjoy themselves
in a Communication of each other's Excellencies, and not in a Triumph
over their Imperfections. <i>Fortius</i> would have been reckoned a Wit, if
there had never been a Fool in the World: He wants not Foils to be a
Beauty, but has that natural Pleasure in observing Perfection in others,
that his own Faults are overlooked out of Gratitude by all his
Acquaintance.<br>
<br>
After these several Characters of Men who succeed or fail in Raillery,
it may not be amiss to reflect a little further what one takes to be the
most agreeable Kind of it; and that to me appears when the Satyr is
directed against Vice, with an Air of Contempt of the Fault, but no
Ill-will to the Criminal. Mr. <i>Congreve's Doris</i> is a Master-piece in
this Kind. It is the Character of a Woman utterly abandoned, but her
Impudence by the finest Piece of Raillery is made only Generosity.

<blockquote><i>Peculiar therefore is her Way,<br>
  Whether by Nature taught,<br>
I shall not undertake to say,<br>
  Or by experience bought;<br><br>

For who o'er Night obtain'd her Grace,<br>
  She can next Day disown,<br>
And stare upon the strange Man's Face,<br>
  As one she ne'er had known,<br>
  <br>
So well she can the Truth disguise,<br>
  Such artful Wonder frame,<br>
The Lover or distrusts his Eyes,<br>
  Or thinks 'twas all a Dream.<br><br>

Some censure this as lewd or low,<br>
  Who are to Bounty blind;<br>
For to forget what we bestow,<br>
  Bespeaks a noble Mind.</i></blockquote>

I look upon my self as a Kind of Guardian to the Fair, and am always
watchful to observe any thing which concerns their Interest. The present
Paper shall be employed in the Service of a very fine young Woman; and
the Admonitions I give her, may not be unuseful to the rest of the Sex.
<i>Gloriana</i> shall be the Name of the Heroine in To-day's Entertainment;
and when I have told you that she is rich, witty, young and beautiful,
you will believe she does not want Admirers. She has had since she came
to Town about twenty five of those Lovers, who make their Addresses by
way of Jointure and Settlement. These come and go, with great
Indifference on both Sides; and as beauteous as she is, a Line in a Deed
has had Exception enough against it, to outweigh the Lustre of her Eyes,
the Readiness of her Understanding, and the Merit of her general
Character. But among the Crowd of such cool Adorers, she has two who are
very assiduous in their Attendance. There is something so extraordinary
and artful in their Manner of Application, that I think it but common
Justice to alarm her in it. I have done it in the following Letter.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
Madam,<br>
<br>
  'I have for some time taken Notice of two Gentlemen who attend you in
  all publick Places, both of whom have also easie Access to you at your
  own House: But the Matter is adjusted between them, and <i>Damon</i>, who
  so passionately addresses you, has no Design upon you; but <i>Strephon</i>,
  who seems to be indifferent to you, is the Man, who is, as they have
  settled it, to have you. The Plot was laid over a Bottle of Wine; and
  <i>Strephon</i>, when he first thought of you, proposed to <i>Damon</i> to be
  his Rival. The manner of his breaking of it to him, I was so placed at
  a Tavern, that I could not avoid hearing. <i>Damon</i>, said he with a deep
  Sigh, I have long languished for that Miracle of Beauty <i>Gloriana</i>,
  and if you will be very stedfastly my Rival, I shall certainly obtain
  her. Do not, continued he, be offended at this Overture; for I go upon
  the Knowledge of the Temper of the Woman, rather than any Vanity that
  I should profit by an Opposition of your Pretensions to those of your
  humble Servant. <i>Gloriana</i> has very good Sense, a quick Relish of the
  Satisfactions of Life, and will not give her self, as the Crowd of
  Women do, to the Arms of a Man to whom she is indifferent. As she is a
  sensible Woman, Expressions of Rapture and Adoration will not move her
  neither; but he that has her must be the Object of her De<b>Sir</b> e, not her
  Pity. The Way to this End I take to be, that a Man's general Conduct
  should be agreeable, without addressing in particular to the Woman he
  loves. Now, <b>Sir</b> , if you will be so kind as to sigh and die for
  <i>Gloriana</i>, I will carry it with great Respect towards her, but seem
  void of any Thoughts as a Lover. By this Means I shall be in the most
  amiable Light of which I am capable; I shall be received with Freedom,
  you with Reserve. <i>Damon</i>, who has himself no Designs of Marriage at
  all, easily fell into the Scheme; and you may observe, that where-ever
  you are <i>Damon</i> appears also. You see he carries on an unaffecting
  Exactness in his Dress and Manner, and strives always to be the very
  Contrary of <i>Strephon</i>. They have already succeeded so far, that your
  Eyes are ever in Search of <i>Strephon</i>, and turn themselves of Course
  from <i>Damon</i>. They meet and compare Notes upon your Carriage; and the
  Letter which, was brought to you the other Day, was a Contrivance to
  remark your Resentment. When you saw the Billet subscribed <i>Damon</i>,
  and turned away with a scornful Air, and cried Impertinence! you gave
  Hopes to him that shuns you, without mortifying him that languishes
  for you. What I am concerned for, Madam, is, that in the disposal of
  your Heart, you should know what you are doing, and examine it before
  it is lost. <i>Strephon</i> contradicts you in Discourse with the Civility
  of one who has a Value for you, but gives up nothing like one that
  loves you. This seeming Unconcern gives this Behaviour the advantage
  of Sincerity, and insensibly obtains your good Opinion, by appearing
  disinterested in the purchase of it. If you watch these Correspondents
  hereafter, you will find that <i>Strephon</i> makes his Visit of Civility
  immediately after <i>Damon</i> has tired you with one of Love. Tho' you are
  very discreet, you will find it no easie matter to escape the Toils so
  well laid, as when one studies to be disagreeable in Passion, the
  other to be pleasing without it. All the Turns of your Temper are
  carefully watched, and their quick and faithful Intelligence gives
  your Lovers irresistible Advantage. You will please, Madam, to be upon
  your guard, and take all the necessary Precautions against one who is
  amiable to you before you know he is enamoured.    <br>
<br>
  <i>I am, Madam, <br>
  Your most Obedient Servant.</i><br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
<i>Strephon</i> makes great Progress in this Lady's good Graces, for most
Women being actuated by some little Spirit of Pride and Contradiction,
he has the good effects of both those Motives by this Covert-Way of
Courtship. He received a Message Yesterday from <i>Damon</i> in the following
Words, superscribed <i>With Speed</i>.

<blockquote>'All goes well; she is very angry at me, and I dare say hates me in
  earnest. It is a good time to Visit. <br>   
  <i>Yours</i>.'</blockquote>

The Comparison of <i>Strephon's</i> Gayety to <i>Damon's</i> Languishment, strikes
her Imagination with a Prospect of very agreeable Hours with such a Man
as the former, and Abhorrence of the insipid Prospect with one like the
latter. To know when a Lady is displeased with another, is to know the
best time of advancing your self. This method of two Persons playing
into each other's Hand is so dangerous, that I cannot tell how a Woman
could be able to withstand such a Siege. The Condition of <i>Gloriana</i>, I
am afraid, is irretrievable, for <i>Strephon</i> has had so many
Opportunities of pleasing without suspicion, that all which is left for
her to do is to bring him, now she is advised, to an Explanation of his
Passion, and beginning again, if she can conquer the kind Sentiments she
has already conceived for him. When one shews himself a Creature to be
avoided, the other proper to be fled to for Succour, they have the whole
Woman between them, and can occasionally rebound her Love and Hatred
from one to the other, in such a manner as to keep her at a distance
from all the rest of the World, and cast Lots for the Conquest.<br>
<br>
<i>N. B.</i> <i>I have many other Secrets which concern the Empire of Love, but I
consider that while I alarm my Women, I instruct my Men</i>.<br>

  <i>London, June</i> 24.<br>
<br>
  <i>Mr</i>. <b>Spectator</b>,<br>
<br>
  'A man who has it in his Power to chuse his own Company, would
  certainly be much to blame should he not, to the best of his Judgment,
  take such as are of a Temper most suitable to his own; and where that
  Choice is wanting, or where a Man is mistaken in his Choice, and yet
  under a Necessity of continuing in the same Company, it will certainly
  be to his Interest to carry himself as easily as possible.<br>
<br>
  'In this I am sensible I do but repeat what has been said a thousand
  times, at which however I think no Body has any Title to take
  Exception, but they who never failed to put this in Practice&mdash;Not to
  use any longer Preface, this being the Season of the Year in which
  great Numbers of all sorts of People retire from this Place of
  Business and Pleasure to Country Solitude, I think it not improper to
  advise them to take with them as great a Stock of Good-humour as they
  can; for tho' a Country-Life is described as the most pleasant of all
  others, and though it may in Truth be so, yet it is so only to those
  who know how to enjoy Leisure and Retirement.<br>
<br>
  'As for those who can't live without the constant helps of Business or
  Company, let them consider, that in the Country there is no
  <i>Exchange</i>, there are no Play-houses, no Variety of Coffee-houses, nor
  many of those other Amusements which serve here as so many Reliefs
  from the repeated Occurrences in their own Families; but that there
  the greatest Part of their Time must be spent within themselves, and
  consequently it behoves them to consider how agreeable it will be to
  them before they leave this dear Town.<br>
<br>
  'I remember, Mr. SPECTATOR, we were very well entertained last Year,
  with the Advices you gave us from <b>Sir</b>  <b>Roger's</b> Country Seat; which I
  the rather mention, because 'tis almost impossible not to live
  pleasantly, where the Master of a Family is such a one as you there
  describe your Friend, who cannot therefore (I mean as to his domestick
  Character) be too often recommended to the Imitation of others. How
  amiable is that Affability and Benevolence with which he treats his
  Neighbours, and every one, even the meanest of his own Family! And yet
  how seldom imitated? instead of which we commonly meet with
  ill-natured Expostulations, Noise, and Chidings&mdash;And this I hinted,
  because the Humour and Disposition of the Head, is what chiefly
  influences all the other Parts of a Family.<br>
<br>
  'An Agreement and kind Correspondence between Friends and
  Acquaintance, is the greatest Pleasure of Life. This is an undoubted
  Truth, and yet any Man who judges from the Practice of the World, will
  be almost persuaded to believe the contrary; for how can we suppose
  People should be so industrious to make themselves uneasie? What can
  engage them to entertain and foment Jealousies of one another upon
  every the least Occasion? Yet so it is, there are People who (as it
  should seem) delight in being troublesome and vexatious, who (as
  <i>Tully</i> speaks) <i>Mira sunt alacritate ad litigandum, Have a certain
  Chearfulness in wrangling</i>. And thus it happens, that there are very
  few Families in which there are not Feuds and Animosities, tho' 'tis
  every one's Interest, there more particularly, to avoid 'em, because
  there (as I would willingly hope) no one gives another Uneasiness,
  without feeling some share of it&mdash;But I am gone beyond what I
  designed, and had almost forgot what I chiefly proposed; which was,
  barely to tell you, how hardly we who pass most of our Time in Town
  dispense with a long Vacation in the Country, how uneasie we grow to
  our selves and to one another when our Conversation is confined,
  insomuch that by <i>Michaelmas</i> 'tis odds but we come to downright
  squabbling, and make as free with one another to our Faces, as we do
  with the rest of the World behind their Backs. After I have told you
  this, I am to de<b>Sir</b> e that you would now and then give us a Lesson of
  Good-humour, a Family-Piece; which, since we are all very fond of you,
  I hope may have some Influence upon us&mdash;<br>
<br>
  'After these plain Observations give me leave to give you an Hint of
  what a Set of Company of my Acquaintance, who are now gone into the
  Country, and have the Use of an absent Nobleman's Seat, have settled
  among themselves, to avoid the Inconveniencies above mentioned. They
  are a Collection of ten or twelve, of the same good Inclination
  towards each other, but of very different Talents and Inclinations:
  From hence they hope, that the Variety of their Tempers will only
  create Variety of Pleasures. But as there always will arise, among the
  same People, either for want of Diversity of Objects, or the like
  Causes, a certain Satiety, which may grow into ill Humour or
  Discontent, there is a large Wing of the House which they design to
  employ in the Nature of an Infirmary. Whoever says a peevish thing, or
  acts any thing which betrays a Sowerness or Indisposition to Company,
  is immediately to be conveyed to his Chambers in the Infirmary; from
  whence he is not to be relieved, till by his Manner of Submission, and
  the Sentiments expressed in his Petition for that Purpose, he appears
  to the Majority of the Company to be again fit for Society. You are to
  understand, that all ill-natured Words or uneasie Gestures are
  sufficient Cause for Banishment; speaking impatiently to Servants,
  making a Man repeat what he says, or any thing that betrays
  Inattention or Dishumour, are also criminal without Reprieve: But it
  is provided, that whoever observes the ill-natured Fit coming upon
  himself, and voluntarily retires, shall be received at his return from
  the Infirmary with the highest Marks of Esteem. By these and other
  wholesome Methods it is expected that if they cannot cure one another,
  yet at least they have taken Care that the ill Humour of one shall not
  be troublesome to the rest of the Company. There are many other Rules
  which the Society have established for the Preservation of their Ease
  and Tranquility, the Effects of which, with the Incidents that arise
  among them, shall be communicated to you from Time to Time for the
  publick Good, by,<br>
<br>

<br>
  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'There is hardly any thing gives me a more sensible Delight, than the
  Enjoyment of a cool still Evening after the Uneasiness of a hot sultry
  Day. Such a one I passed not long ago, which made me rejoice when the
  Hour as come for the Sun to set, that I might enjoy the Freshness of
  the Evening in my Garden, which then affords me the pleasantest Hours
  I pass in the whole Four and twenty. I immediately rose from my Couch,
  and went down into it. You descend at first by twelve Stone Steps into
  a large Square divided into four Grass-plots, in each of which is a
  Statue of white Marble. This is separated from a large Parterre by a
  low Wall, and from thence, thro' a Pair of Iron Gates, you are led
  into a long broad Walk of the finest Turf, set on each Side with tall
  Yews, and on either Hand bordered by a Canal, which on the Right
  divides the Walk from a Wilderness parted into Variety of Allies and
  Arbours, and on the Left from a kind of Amphitheatre, which is the
  Receptacle of a great Number of Oranges and Myrtles. The Moon shone
  bright, and seemed then most agreeably to supply the Place of the Sun,
  obliging me with as much Light as was necessary to discover a thousand
  pleasing Objects, and at the same time divested of all Power of Heat.
  The Reflection of it in the Water, the Fanning of the Wind rustling on
  the Leaves, the Singing of the Thrush and Nightingale, and the
  Coolness of the Walks, all conspired to make me lay aside all
  displeasing Thoughts, and brought me into such a Tranquility of Mind,
  as is I believe the next Happiness to that of hereafter. In this sweet
  Retirement I naturally fell into the Repetition of some Lines out of a
  Poem of <i>Milton's</i>, which he entitles <i>Il Penseroso</i>, the Ideas of
  which were exquisitely suited to my present Wandrings of Thought.

<blockquote><i>Sweet Bird! that shun'st the Noise of Folly,<br>
Most musical! most melancholy!<br>
Thee Chauntress, oft the Woods among,<br>
I wooe to hear thy Evening Song:<br>
And missing thee, I walk unseen<br>
On the dry smooth-shaven Green,<br>
To behold the wandring Moon,<br>
Riding near her highest Noon,<br>
Like one that hath been led astray,<br>
Thro' the Heavn's wide pathless Way,<br>
And oft, as if her Head she bow'd,<br>
Stooping thro' a fleecy Cloud.<br>
Then let some strange mysterious Dream<br>
Wave with his Wings in airy Stream,<br>
Of lively Portraiture displaid,<br>
Softly on my Eyelids laid;<br>
And as I wake, sweet Musick breathe<br>
Above, about, or underneath,<br>
Sent by Spirits to Mortals Good,<br>
Or th' unseen Genius of the Wood.</i></blockquote>

  I reflected then upon the sweet Vicissitudes of Night and Day, on the
  charming Disposition of the Seasons, and their Return again in a
  perpetual Circle; and oh! said I, that I could from these my declining
  Years return again to my first Spring of Youth and Vigour; but that,
  alas! is impossible: All that remains within my Power, is to soften
  the Inconveniences I feel, with an easie contented Mind, and the
  Enjoyment of such Delights as this Solitude affords me. In this
  Thought I sate me down on a Bank of Flowers and dropt into a Slumber,
  which whether it were the Effect of Fumes and Vapours, or my present
  Thoughts, I know not; but methought the Genius of the Garden stood
  before me, and introduced into the Walk where I lay this Drama and
  different Scenes of the Revolution of the Year, which whilst I then
  saw, even in my Dream, I resolved to write down, and send to the
  SPECTATOR.

  The first Person whom I saw advancing towards me was a Youth of a most
  beautiful Air and Shape, tho' he seemed not yet arrived at that exact
  Proportion and Symmetry of Parts which a little more time would have
  given him; but however, there was such a Bloom in his Countenance,
  such Satisfaction and Joy, that I thought it the most de<b>Sir</b> able Form
  that I had ever seen. He was cloathed in a flowing Mantle of green
  Silk, interwoven with Flowers: He had a Chaplet of Roses on his Head,
  and a <i>Narcissus</i> in his Hand; Primroses and Violets sprang up under
  his Feet, and all Nature was cheer'd at his Approach. <i>Flora</i> was on
  one Hand and <i>Vertumnus</i> on the other in a Robe of changeable Silk.
  After this I was surprized to see the Moon-beams reflected with a
  sudden Glare from Armour, and to see a Man compleatly armed advancing
  with his Sword drawn. I was soon informed by the Genius it was <i>Mars</i>,
  who had long usurp'd a Place among the Attendants of the <i>Spring</i>. He
  made Way for a softer Appearance, it was <i>Venus</i>, without any Ornament
  but her own Beauties, not so much as her own Cestus, with which she
  had incompass'd a Globe, which she held in her right Hand, and in her
  left she had a Sceptre of Gold. After her followed the Graces with
  their Arms intwined within one another, their Girdles were loosed, and
  they moved to the Sound of soft Musick, striking the Ground
  alternately with their Feet: Then came up the three Months which
  belong to this Season. As <i>March</i> advanced towards me, there was
  methought in his Look a louring Roughness, which ill befitted a Month
  which was ranked in so soft a Season; but as he came forwards his
  Features became insensibly more mild and gentle: He smooth'd his Brow,
  and looked with so sweet a Countenance that I could not but lament his
  Departure, though he made way for <i>April</i>. He appeared in the greatest
  Gaiety imaginable, and had a thousand Pleasures to attend him: His
  Look was frequently clouded, but immediately return'd to its first
  Composure, and remained fixed in a Smile. Then came <i>May</i> attended by
  <i>Cupid</i>, with his Bow strung, and in a Posture to let fly an Arrow: As
  he passed by methought I heard a confused Noise of soft Complaints,
  gentle Ecstacies, and tender Sighs of Lovers; Vows of Constancy, and
  as many Complainings of Perfidiousness; all which the Winds wafted
  away as soon as they had reached my Hearing. After these I saw a Man
  advance in the full Prime and Vigour of his Age, his Complexion was
  sanguine and ruddy, his Hair black, and fell down in beautiful
  Ringlets not beneath his Shoulders, a Mantle of Hair-colour'd Silk
  hung loosely upon him: He advanced with a hasty Step after the
  <i>Spring</i>, and sought out the Shade and cool Fountains which plaid in
   the Garden. He was particularly well pleased when a Troop of <i>Zephyrs</i>
  fanned him with their Wings: He had two Companions who walked on each
  Side that made him appear the most agreeable, the one was <i>Aurora</i>
  with Fingers of Roses, and her Feet dewy, attired in grey: The other
  was <i>Vesper</i> in a Robe of Azure beset with Drops of Gold, whose Breath
  he caught whilst it passed over a Bundle of Honey-Suckles and
  Tuberoses which he held in his Hand. <i>Pan</i> and <i>Ceres</i> followed them
  with four Reapers, who danced a Morrice to the Sound of Oaten Pipes
  and Cymbals. Then came the Attendant Months. <i>June</i> retained still
  some small Likeness of the <i>Spring</i>; but the other two seemed to step
  with a less vigorous Tread, especially <i>August</i>, who seem'd almost to
  faint whilst for half the Steps he took the Dog-Star levelled his Rays
  full at his Head: They passed on and made Way for a Person that seemed
  to bend a little under the Weight of Years; his Beard and Hair, which
  were full grown, were composed of an equal Number of black and grey;
  he wore a Robe which he had girt round him of a yellowish Cast, not
  unlike the Colour of fallen Leaves, which he walked upon. I thought he
  hardly made Amends for expelling the foregoing Scene by the large
  Quantity of Fruits which he bore in his Hands. <i>Plenty</i> walked by his
  Side with an healthy fresh Countenance, pouring out from an Horn all
  the various Product of the Year. <i>Pomona</i> followed with a Glass of
  Cyder in her Hand, with <i>Bacchus</i> in a Chariot drawn by Tygers,
  accompanied by a whole Troop of Satyrs, Fauns, and Sylvans.
  <i>September</i>, who came next, seem'd in his Looks to promise a new
  <i>Spring</i>, and wore the Livery of those Months. The succeeding Month
  was all soiled with the Juice of Grapes, as if he had just come from
  the Wine-Press. <i>November</i>, though he was in this Division, yet, by
  the many Stops he made seemed rather inclined to the <i>Winter</i>, which
  followed close at his Heels. He advanced in the Shape of an old Man in
  the Extremity of Age: The Hair he had was so very white it seem'd a
  real Snow; his Eyes were red and piercing, and his Beard hung with a
  great Quantity of Icicles: He was wrapt up in Furrs, but yet so
  pinched with Excess of Cold that his Limbs were all contracted and his
  Body bent to the Ground, so that he could not have supported himself
  had it not been for <i>Comus</i> the God of Revels, and <i>Necessity</i> the
  Mother of Fate, who sustained him on each side. The Shape and Mantle
  of <i>Comus</i> was one of the things that most surprized me; as he
  advanced towards me, his Countenance seemed the most de<b>Sir</b> able I had
  ever seen: On the fore Part of his Mantle was pictured Joy, Delight,
  and Satisfaction, with a thousand Emblems of Merriment, and Jests with
  Faces looking two Ways at once; but as he passed from me I was amazed
  at a Shape so little correspondent to his Face: His Head was bald, and
  all the rest of his Limbs appeared old and deformed. On the hinder
  Part of his Mantle was represented Murder with dishevelled Hair and a
  Dagger all bloody, Anger in a Robe of Scarlet, and Suspicion squinting
  with both Eyes; but above all the most conspicuous was the Battel of
  the <i>Lapith&aelig;</i> and the <i>Centaurs</i>. I detested so hideous a Shape, and
  turned my Eyes upon <i>Saturn</i>, who was stealing away behind him with a
  Scythe in one Hand, and an Hour-glass in t'other unobserved. Behind
  <i>Necessity</i> was <i>Vesta</i> the Goddess of Fire with a Lamp which was
  perpetually supply'd with Oyl; and whose Flame was eternal. She
  cheered the rugged Brow of <i>Necessity</i>, and warmed her so far as
  almost to make her assume the Features and Likeness of <i>Choice.
  December, January,</i> and <i>February</i>, passed on after the rest all in
  Furrs; there was little Distinction to be made amongst them, and they
  were only more or less displeasing as they discovered more or less
  Haste towards the grateful Return of <i>Spring.</i></blockquote>

A very agreeable Friend of mine, the other Day, carrying me in his Coach
into the Country to Dinner, fell into Discourse concerning the Care of
Parents due to their Children, and the Piety of Children towards their
Parents. He was reflecting upon the Succession of particular Virtues and
Qualities there might be preserved from one Generation to another, if
these Regards were reciprocally held in Veneration: But as he never
fails to mix an Air of Mirth and good Humour with his good Sense and
Reasoning, he entered into the following Relation.<br>
<br>
I will not be confident in what Century, or under what Reign it
happened, that this Want of mutual Confidence and right Understanding
between Father and Son was fatal to the Family of the <i>Valentines</i> in
<i>Germany</i>. <i>Basilius Valentinus</i> was a Person who had arrived at the
utmost Perfection in the Hermetick Art, and initiated his Son
<i>Alexandrinus</i> in the same Mysteries: But as you know they are not to be
attained but by the Painful, the Pious, the Chaste, and Pure of Heart,
<i>Basilius</i> did not open to him, because of his Youth, and the Deviations
too natural to it, the greatest Secrets of which he was Master, as well
knowing that the Operation would fail in the Hands of a Man so liable to
Errors in Life as <i>Alexandrinus</i>. But believing, from a certain
Indisposition of Mind as well as Body, his Dissolution was drawing nigh,
he called <i>Alexandrinus</i> to him, and as he lay on a Couch, over-against
which his Son was seated, and prepared by sending out Servants one after
another, and Admonition to examine that no one over-heard them, he
revealed the most important of his Secrets with the Solemnity and
Language of an Adept. My Son, said he, many have been the Watchings,
long the Lucubrations, constant the Labours of thy Father, not only to
gain a great and plentiful Estate to his Posterity, but also to take
Care that he should have no Posterity. Be not amazed, my Child; I do not
mean that thou shalt be taken from me, but that I will never leave thee,
and consequently cannot be said to have Posterity. Behold, my dearest
<i>Alexandrinus</i>, the Effect of what was propagated in nine Months: We are
not to contradict Nature but to follow and to help her; just as long as
an Infant is in the Womb of its Parent, so long are these Medicines of
Revification in preparing. Observe this small Phial and this little
Gallipot, in this an Unguent, in the other a Liquor. In these, my child,
are collected such Powers, as shall revive the Springs of Life when they
are yet but just ceased, and give new Strength, new Spirits, and, in a
Word, wholly restore all the Organs and Senses of the human Body to as
great a Duration, as it had before enjoyed from its Birth to the Day of
the Application of these my Medicines. But, my beloved Son, Care must be
taken to apply them within ten Hours after the Breath is out of the
Body, while yet the Clay is warm with its late Life, and yet capable of
Resuscitation. I find my Frame grown crasie with perpetual Toil and
Meditation; and I conjure you, as soon as I am dead, to anoint me with
this Unguent; and when you see me begin to move, pour into my Lips this
inestimable Liquor, else the Force of the Ointment will be ineffectual.
By this Means you will give me Life as I have you, and we will from that
Hour mutually lay aside the Authority of having bestowed Life on each
other, but live as Brethren, and prepare new Medicines against such
another Period of Time as will demand another Application of the same
Restoratives. In a few Days after these wonderful Ingredients were
delivered to <i>Alexandrinus</i>, <i>Basilius</i> departed this Life. But such was
the pious Sorrow of the Son at the Loss of so excellent a Father, and
the first Transports of Grief had so wholly disabled him from all manner
of Business, that he never thought of the Medicines till the Time to
which his Father had limited their Efficacy was expired. To tell the
Truth, <i>Alexandrinus</i> was a Man of Wit and Pleasure, and considered his
Father had lived out his natural Time, his Life was long and uniform,
suitable to the Regularity of it; but that he himself, poor Sinner,
wanted a new Life, to repent of a very bad one hitherto; and in the
Examination of his Heart, resolved to go on as he did with this natural
Being of his, but repent very faithfully and spend very piously the Life
to which he should be restored by Application of these Rarities, when
Time should come, to his own Person.<br>
<br>
It has been observed, that Providence frequently punishes the Self-love
of Men who would do immoderately for their own Off-spring, with Children
very much below their Characters and Qualifications, insomuch that they
only transmit their Names to be born by those who give daily Proofs of
the Vanity of the Labour and Ambition of their Progenitors.<br>
<br>
It happened thus in the Family of <i>Basilius</i>; for  <i>Alexandrinus</i> began
to enjoy his ample Fortune in all the Extremities of Houshold Expence,
Furniture, and insolent Equipage; and this he pursued till the Day of
his own Departure began, as he grew sensible, to approach. As <i>Basilius</i>
was punished with a Son very unlike him, <i>Alexandrinus</i> was visited with
one of his own Disposition. It is natural that ill Men should be
suspicious, and <i>Alexandrinus</i>, besides that Jealousie, had Proofs of
the vitious Disposition of his Son <i>Renatus</i>, for that was his Name.<br>
<br>
<i>Alexandrinus</i>, as I observed, having very good Reasons for thinking it
unsafe to trust the real Secret of his Phial and Gallypot to any Man
living, projected to make sure Work, and hope for his Success depending
from the Avarice, not the Bounty of his Benefactor.<br>
<br>
With this Thought he called <i>Renatus</i> to his Bed-side, and bespoke him
in the most pathetick Gesture and Accent. As much, my Son, as you have
been addicted to Vanity and Pleasure, as I also have been before you,
you nor I could escape the Fame, or the good Effects of the profound
Knowledge of our Progenitor, the Renowned <i>Basilius</i>. His Symbol is very
well known in the Philosophick World, and I shall never forget the
venerable Air of his Countenance, when he let me into the profound
Mysteries of <i>the Smaragdine Table of</i> Hermes. <i>It is true</i>, said he,
<i>and far removed from all Colour of Deceit, That which is Inferior is
like that which is Superior, by which are acquired and perfected all the
Miracles of a certain Work. The Father is the Sun, the Mother the Moon:
the Wind is the Womb, the Earth is the Nurse of it, and Mother of all
Perfection. All this must be received with Modesty and Wisdom.</i> The
Chymical People carry in all their Jargon a whimsical sort of Piety,
which is ordinary with great Lovers of Money, and is no more but
deceiving themselves, that their Regularity and Strictness of Manners
for the Ends of this World, has some Affinity to the Innocence of Heart
which must recommend them to the next. <i>Renatus</i> wondered to hear his
Father talk so like an Adept, and with such a Mixture of Piety, while
<i>Alexandrinus</i> observing his Attention fixed, proceeded: This Phial,
Child, and this little Earthen-Pot will add to thy Estate so much, as to
make thee the richest Man in the <i>German</i> Empire. I am going to my Long
Home, but shall not return to common Dust. Then he resumed a Countenance
of Alacrity, and told him, That if within an Hour after his Death he
anointed his whole Body, and poured down his Throat that Liquor which he
had from old <i>Basilius</i>, the Corps would be converted into pure Gold. I
will not pretend to express to you the unfeigned Tendernesses that
passed between these two extraordinary Persons; but if the Father
recommended the Care of his Remains with Vehemence and Affection, the
Son was not behind-hand in professing that he would not cut the least
Bit off him, but upon the utmost Extremity, or to provide for his
younger Brothers and Sisters.<br>
<br>
Well, <i>Alexandrinus</i> died, and the Heir of his Body (as our Term is)
could not forbear in the Wantonness of his Heart, to measure the Length
and Breadth of his beloved Father, and cast up the ensuing Value of him
before he proceeded to Operation. When he knew the immense Reward of his
Pains, he began the Work: <a name="fr4261">But</a> lo! when he had anointed the Corps all
over, and began to apply the Liquor, the Body stirred, and <i>Renatus</i>, in
a Fright, broke the Phial<a href="#f4261"><sup>1</sup></a>.<br>

Mandelslo, translated from the German of Olearius, by J. B. B.  Bk v. p.

of the romances of Virgil the Enchanter, was an able chemist (in those
days an alchemist) of the sixteenth century, who is believed to have
been a Benedictine monk of Erfurth, and is not known to have had any
children. He was the author of the <i>Currus Triumphalis Antimonii</i>,
mentioned in a former note. His name was familiar through several books
in French, especially <i>L'Azoth des Philosophes, avec les 12 Clefs de

(London, 1671).<br>

It is a certain Sign of an ill Heart to be inclined to Defamation. They
who are harmless and innocent, can have no Gratification that way; but
it ever arises from a Neglect of what is laudable in a Man's self, and
an Impatience of seeing it in another. Else why should Virtue provoke?
Why should Beauty displease in such a Degree, that a Man given to
Scandal never lets the Mention of either pass by him without offering
something to the Diminution of it? A Lady the other Day at a Visit being
attacked somewhat rudely by one, whose own Character has been very
roughly treated, answered a great deal of Heat and Intemperance very
calmly, <i>Good Madam spare me, who am none of your Match; I speak Ill of
no Body, and it is a new Thing to me to be spoken ill of.</i> Little Minds
think Fame consists in the Number of Votes they have on their Side among
the Multitude, whereas it is really the inseparable Follower of good and
worthy Actions. Fame is as natural a Follower of Merit, as a Shadow is
of a Body. It is true, when Crowds press upon you, this Shadow cannot be
seen, but when they separate from around you, it will again appear. The
Lazy, the Idle, and the Froward, are the Persons who are most pleas'd
with the little Tales which pass about the Town to the Disadvantage of
the rest of the World. Were it not for the Pleasure of speaking Ill,
there are Numbers of People who are too lazy to go out of their own
Houses, and too ill-natur'd to open their Lips in Conversation. It was
not a little diverting the other Day to observe a Lady reading a
Post-Letter, and at these Words, <i>After all her Airs, he has heard some
Story or other, and the Match is broke off</i>, give Orders in the midst of
her Reading, <i>Put to the Horses.</i> That a young Woman of Merit has missed
an advantagious Settlement, was News not to be delayed, lest some Body
else should have given her malicious Acquaintance that Satisfaction
before her. The Unwillingness to receive good Tidings is a Quality as
inseparable from a Scandal-Bearer, as the Readiness to divulge bad. But,
alas, how wretchedly low and contemptible is that State of Mind, that
cannot be pleased but by what is the Subject of Lamentation. This Temper
has ever been in the highest Degree odious to gallant Spirits. The
<i>Persian</i> Soldier, who was heard reviling <i>Alexander</i> the Great, was
well admonished by his Officer; <i><b>Sir</b> , you are paid to fight against</i>
Alexander, <i>and not to rail at him</i>.<br>
<br>
<i>Cicero</i> in <a name="fr4271">one</a> of his Pleadings<a href="#f4271"><sup>1</sup></a>, defending his Client from general
Scandal, says very handsomely, and with much Reason, <i>There are many who
have particular Engagements to the Prosecutor: There are many who are
known to have ill-will to him for whom I appear; there are many who are
naturally addicted to Defamation, and envious of any Good to any Man,
who may have contributed to spread Reports of this kind: For nothing is
so swift as Scandal, nothing is more easily sent abroad, nothing
received with more Welcome, nothing diffuses it self so universally. I
shall not de<b>Sir</b> e, that if any Report to our Disadvantage has any Ground
for it, you would overlook or extenuate it: But if there be any thing
advanced without a Person who can say whence he had it, or which is
attested by one who forgot who told him it, or who had it from one of so
little Consideration that he did not then think it worth his Notice, all
such Testimonies as these, I know, you will think too slight to have any
Credit against the Innocence and Honour of your Fellow-Citizen</i>. When an
ill Report is traced, it very often vanishes among such as the Orator
has here recited. And how despicable a Creature must that be, who is in
Pain for what passes among so frivolous a People? There is a Town in
<i>Warwickshire</i> of good Note, and formerly pretty famous for much
Animosity and Dissension, the chief Families of which have now turned
all their Whispers, Backbitings, Envies, and private Malices, into Mirth
and Entertainment, by means of a peevish old Gentlewoman, known by the
Title of the Lady <i>Bluemantle</i>. This Heroine had for many Years together
out-done the whole Sisterhood of Gossips in Invention, quick Utterance,
and unprovoked Malice. This good Body is of a lasting Constitution,
though extremely decayed in her Eyes, and decrepid in her Feet. The two
Circumstances of being always at Home from her Lameness, and very
attentive from her Blindness, make her Lodgings the Receptacle of all
that passes in Town, Good or Bad; but for the latter, she seems to have
the better Memory. There is another Thing to be noted of her, which is,
That as it is usual with old People, she has a livelier Memory of Things
which passed when she was very young, than of late Years. Add to all
this, that she does not only not love any Body, but she hates every
Body. The Statue in Rome does not serve to vent Malice half so well, as
this old Lady does to disappoint it. She does not know the Author of any
thing that is told her, but can readily repeat the Matter it self;
therefore, though she exposes all the whole Town, she offends no one
Body in it. She is so exquisitely restless and peevish, that she
quarrels with all about her, and sometimes in a Freak will instantly
change her Habitation. To indulge this Humour, she is led about the
Grounds belonging to the same House she is in, and the Persons to whom
she is to remove, being in the Plot, are ready to receive her at her own
Chamber again. At stated Times, the Gentlewoman at whose House she
supposes she is at the Time, is sent for to quarrel with, according to
her common Custom: When they have a Mind to drive the Jest, she is
immediately urged to that Degree, that she will board in a Family with
which she has never yet been; and away she will go this Instant, and
tell them all that the rest have been saying of them. By this means she
has been an Inhabitant of every House in the Place without stirring from
the same Habitation; and the many Stories which every body furnishes her
with to favour that Deceit, make her the general Intelligencer of the
Town of all that can be said by one Woman against another. Thus
groundless Stories die away, and sometimes Truths are smothered under
the general Word: When they have a Mind to discountenance a thing, Oh!
that is in my Lady <i>Bluemantle's</i> Memoirs.<br>
<br>
Whoever receives Impressions to the Disadvantage of others without
Examination, is to be had in no other Credit for Intelligence than this
good Lady <i>Bluemantle</i>, who is subjected to have her Ears imposed upon
for want of other Helps to better Information. Add to this, that other
Scandal-Bearers suspend the Use of these Faculties which she has lost,
rather than apply them to do Justice to their Neighbours; and I think,
for the Service of my fair Readers, to acquaint them, that there is a
voluntary Lady <i>Bluemantle</i> at every Visit in Town.<br>

It is an impertinent and unreasonable Fault in Conversation, for one Man
to take up all the Discourse. It may possibly be objected to me my self,
that I am guilty in this kind, in entertaining the Town every Day, and
not giving so many able Persons who have it more in their Power, and as
much in their Inclination, an Opportunity to oblige Mankind with their
Thoughts. Besides, said one whom I overheard the other Day, why must
this Paper turn altogether upon Topicks of Learning and Morality? Why
should it pretend only to Wit, Humour, or the like? Things which are
useful only to amuse Men of Literature and superior Education. I would
have it consist also of all Things which may be necessary or useful to
any Part of Society, and the mechanick Arts should have their Place as
well as the Liberal. The Ways of Gain, Husbandry, and Thrift, will serve
a greater Number of People, than Discourses upon what was well said or
done by such a Philosopher, Heroe, General, or Poet. I no sooner heard
this Critick talk of my Works, but I minuted what he had said; and from
that Instant resolved to enlarge the Plan of my Speculations, by giving
Notice to all Persons of all Orders, and each Sex, that if they are
pleased to send me Discourses, with their Names and Places of Abode to
them, so that I can be satisfied the Writings are authentick, such their
Labours shall be faithfully inserted in this Paper. It will be of much
more Consequence to a Youth in his Apprenticeship, to know by what Rules
and Arts such a one became Sheriff of the City of <i>London</i>, than to see
the Sign of one of his own Quality with a Lion's Heart in each Hand. The
World indeed is enchanted with romantick and improbable Atchievements,
when the plain Path to respective Greatness and Success in the Way of
Life a Man is in, is wholly overlooked. Is it possible that a young Man
at present could pass his Time better, than in reading the History of
Stocks, and knowing by what secret Springs they have had such sudden
Ascents and Falls in the same Day? Could he be better conducted in his
Way to Wealth, which is the great Article of Life, than in a Treatise
dated from <i>Change-Alley</i> by an able Proficient there? Nothing certainly
could be more useful, than to be well instructed in his Hopes and Fears;
to be diffident when others exult, and with a secret Joy buy when others
think it their Interest to sell. I invite all Persons who have any thing
to say for the Profitable Information of the Publick, to take their
Turns in my Paper: They <a name="fr4281">are</a> welcome, from the late noble Inventor of the
Longitude<a href="#f4281"><sup>1</sup></a>, to the humble Author of Strops for Razors. If to carry
Ships in Safety, to give Help to People tost in a troubled Sea, without
knowing to what Shoar they bear, what Rocks to avoid, or what Coast to
pray for in their Extremity, be a worthy Labour, and an Invention that
deserves a Statue; at the same Time, he who has found a Means to let the
Instrument <a name="fr4282">which</a> is to make your Visage less <span style="color: #663300;">horrible</span><a href="#f4282"><sup>2</sup></a>, and your
Person more smug, easie in the Operation, is worthy of some kind of good
Reception: If Things of high Moment meet with Renown, those of little
Consideration, since of any Consideration, are not to be despised. In
order that no Merit may lye hid and no Art unimproved, I repeat it, that
I call Artificers, as well as Philosophers, to my Assistance in the
Publick Service. It would be of great Use if we had an exact History of
the Successes of every great Shop within the City-Walls, what Tracts of
Land have been purchased by a constant Attendance within a Walk of
thirty Foot. If it could also be noted in the Equipage of those who are
ascended from the Successful Trade of their Ancestors into Figure and
Equipage, such Accounts would quicken Industry in the Pursuit of such
Acquisitions, and discountenance Luxury in the Enjoyment of them.<br>
<br>
To diversifie these kinds of Informations, the Industry of the Female
World is not to be unobserved: She to whose Houshold Virtues it is
owing, that Men do Honour to her Husband, should be recorded with
Veneration; she who had wasted his Labours, with Infamy. When we are
come into Domestick Life in this manner, to awaken Caution and
Attendance to the main Point, it <a name="fr4283">would</a> not be amiss to give now and then
a Touch of Tragedy, and describe <span style="color: #663300;">the</span><a href="#f4283"><sup>3</sup></a> most dreadful of all human
Conditions, the Case of Bankruptcy; how Plenty, Credit, Chearfulness,
full Hopes, and easy Possessions, are in an Instant turned into Penury,
faint Aspects, Diffidence, Sorrow, and Misery; how the Man, who with an
open Hand the Day before could administer to the Extremities of others,
is shunned today by the Friend of his Bosom. It would be useful to shew
how just this is on the Negligent, how lamentable on the Industrious. A
Paper written by a Merchant, might give this Island a true Sense of the
Worth and Importance of his Character: It might be visible from what he
could say, That no Soldier entring a Breach adventures more for Honour,
than the Trader does for Wealth to his Country. In both Cases the
Adventurers have their own Advantage, but I know no Cases wherein every
Body else is a Sharer in the Success.<br>
<br>
It is objected by Readers of History, That the Battels in those
Narrations are scarce ever to be understood. This Misfortune is to be
ascribed to the Ignorance of Historians in the Methods of drawing up,
changing the Forms of a Battalia, and the Enemy retreating from, as well
as approaching to, the Charge. But in the Discourses from the
Correspondents, whom I now invite, the Danger will be of another kind;
and it is necessary to caution them only against using Terms of Art, and
describing Things that are familiar to them in Words unknown to their
Readers. I promise my self a great Harvest of new Circumstances,
Persons, and Things from this Proposal; and a World, which many think
they are well acquainted with, discovered as wholly new. This Sort of
Intelligence will give a lively Image of the Chain and mutual Dependance
of humane Society, take off impertinent Prejudices, enlarge the Minds of
those, whose Views are confined to their own Circumstances; and, in
short, if the Knowing in several Arts, Professions, and Trades will
exert themselves, it cannot but produce a new Field of Diversion, an
Instruction more agreeable than has yet appeared.<br>

<a name="f4281"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote 1:</span></a> &nbsp; If this means the Marquis of Worcester, the exact
ascertainment of the longitude was not one of his century of Inventions.
The sextant had its origin in the mind of <b>Sir</b>  Isaac Newton, who was
knighted in 1705, and living at this time, but its practical inventor
was Thomas Godfrey, a glazier at Philadelphia. Godfrey's instrument is
said to have been seen by John Hadley, or that English philosopher,
after whom the instrument is named, invented it at the same time, about
1730. Honours of invention were assigned to both Godfrey and Hadley.
Means of exact observation of the heavenly bodies would not suffice for
exact determining of longitude until the sailor was provided with a
timepiece that could be relied upon in all climates for a true uniform
standard of time. The invention of such a time-piece, for which
Parliament offered a reward of &pound;20,000, was the real solution of the
difficulty, and this we owe to the Yorkshireman John Harrison, a
carpenter and son of a carpenter, who had a genius for clockmaking, and
was stimulated to work at the construction of marine chronometers by
living in sight of the sea. He came to London in 1728, and after fifty
years of labour finished in 1759 a chronometer which, having stood the
test of two voyages, obtained for him the offered reward of &pound;20,000.
Harrison died in 1776 at the age of 83.<br>

  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  Since I gave an Account of an agreeable Set of Company which were gone
  down into the Country, I have received Advices from thence, that the
  Institution of an Infirmary for those who should be out of Humour, has
  had very good Effects. My Letters mention particular Circumstances of
  two or three Persons, who had the good Sense to retire of their own
  Accord, and notified that they were withdrawn, with the Reasons of it,
  to the Company, in their respective Memorials.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><i>The Memorial of Mrs</i>. Mary Dainty, <i>Spinster</i>,<br>
<br>
    Humbly Sheweth,<br>
<br>
    That conscious of her own want of Merit, accompanied with a Vanity
    of being admired, she had gone into Exile of her own accord.<br>
<br>
    She is sensible, that a vain Person is the most insufferable
    Creature living in a well-bred Assembly.<br>
<br>
    That she de<b>Sir</b> ed, before she appeared in publick again, she might
    have Assurances, that tho' she might be thought handsome, there
    might not more Address or Compliment be paid to her, than to the
    rest of the Company.<br>
<br>
    That she conceived it a kind of Superiority, that one Person should
    take upon him to commend another.<br>
<br>
    Lastly, That she went into the Infirmary, to avoid a particular
    Person who took upon him to profess an Admiration of her.<br>
<br>
    She therefore prayed, that to applaud out of due place, might be
    declar'd an Offence, and punished in the same Manner with
    Detraction, in that the latter did but report Persons defective, and
    the former made them so.<br>
<br>
    All which is submitted, &amp;c.</blockquote>

  There appeared a Delicacy and Sincerity in this Memorial very
  uncommon, but my Friend informs me, that the Allegations of it were
  groundless, insomuch that this Declaration of an Aversion to being
  praised, was understood to be no other than a secret Trap to purchase
  it, for which Reason it lies still on the Table unanswered.

<blockquote>    <i>The humble Memorial of the Lady</i> Lydia Loller, Sheweth,<br>
<br>
    That the Lady <i>Lydia</i> is a Woman of Quality; married to a private
    Gentleman.<br>
<br>
    That she finds her self neither well nor ill.<br>
<br>
    That her Husband is a Clown.<br>
<br>
    That Lady <i>Lydia</i> cannot see Company. That she de<b>Sir</b> es the Infirmary
    may be her Apartment during her stay in the Country.<br>
<br>
    That they would please to make merry with their Equals.<br>
<br>
    That Mr. <i>Loller</i> might stay with them if he thought fit.</blockquote>

It was immediately resolved, that Lady <i>Lydia</i> was still at <i>London</i>.

<blockquote>    <i>The humble Memorial</i> of Thomas Sudden, <i>Esq</i>., of the Inner-Temple,
    Sheweth,<br>
<br>
    That Mr. <i>Sudden</i> is conscious that he is too much given to
    Argumentation.<br>
<br>
    That he talks loud.<br>
<br>
    That he is apt to think all things matter of Debate.<br>
<br>
    That he stayed behind in <i>Westminster-Hall</i>, when the late Shake of
    the Roof happened, only because a Council of the other Side asserted
    it was coming down.<br>
<br>
    That he cannot for his Life consent to any thing.<br>
<br>
    That he stays in the Infirmary to forget himself.<br>
<br>
    That as soon as he has forgot himself, he will wait on the Company.</blockquote>

  His Indisposition was allowed to be sufficient to require a Cessation
  from Company.

<blockquote>    <i>The Memorial</i> of Frank Jolly, Sheweth,<br>
<br>
    That he hath put himself into the Infirmary, in regard he is
    sensible of a certain rustick Mirth which renders him unfit for
    polite Conversation.<br>
<br>
    That he intends to prepare himself by Abstinence and thin Diet to be
    one of the Company.<br>
<br>
    That at present he comes into a Room as if he were an Express from
    Abroad.<br>
<br>
    That he has chosen an Apartment with a matted Anti-Chamber, to
    practise Motion without being heard.<br>
<br>
    That he bows, talks, drinks, eats, and helps himself before a Glass,
    to learn to act with Moderation.<br>
<br>
    That by reason of his luxuriant Health he is oppressive to Persons
    of composed Behaviour.<br>
<br>
    That he is endeavouring to forget the Word <i>Pshaw, Pshaw</i>.<br>
<br>
    That he is also weaning himself from his Cane.<br>
<br>
    That when he has learnt to live without his said Cane, he will wait
    on the Company, &amp;c.</blockquote>
...
<blockquote>    <i>The Memorial</i> of John Rhubarb, <i>Esq</i>.,<br>
<br>
    Sheweth,<br>
<br>
    That your Petitioner has retired to the Infirmary, but that he is
    in perfect good Health, except that he has by long Use. and for want
    of Discourse, contracted an Habit of Complaint that he is sick.<br>
<br>
    That he wants for nothing under the Sun, but what to say, and
    therefore has fallen into this unhappy Malady of complaining that he
    is sick.<br>
<br>
    That this Custom of his makes him, by his own Confession, fit only
    for the Infirmary, and therefore he has not waited for being
    sentenced to it.<br>
<br>
    That he is conscious there is nothing more improper than such a
    Complaint in good Company, in that they must pity, whether they
    think the Lamenter ill or not; and that the Complainant must make a
    silly Figure, whether he is pitied or not.<br>
<br>
    Your Petitioner humbly prays, that he may have Time to know how he
    does, and he will make his Appearance.</blockquote>

  The Valetudinarian was likewise easily excused; and this Society being
  resolved not only to make it their Business to pass their Time
  agreeably for the present Season, but also to commence such Habits in
  themselves as may be of Use in their future Conduct in general, are
  very ready to give into a fancied or real Incapacity to join with
  their Measures, in order to have no Humourist, proud Man, impertinent
  or sufficient ellow, break in upon their Happiness. Great Evils seldom
  happen to disturb Company; but Indulgence in Particularities of
  Humour, is the Seed of making half our Time hang in Suspence, or waste
  away under real Discomposures.<br>
<br>
  Among other Things it is carefully provided that there may not be
  disagreeable Familiarities. No one is to appear in the publick Rooms
  undressed, or enter abruptly into each other's Apartment without
  intimation. Every one has hitherto been so careful in his Behaviour,
  that there has but one Offender in ten Days Time been sent into the
  Infirmary, and that was for throwing away his Cards at Whist.<br>
<br>
He has offered his Submission in the following Terms.

<blockquote>    <i>The humble Petition of</i> Jeoffry Hotspur, <i>Esq</i>.,<br>
<br>
    Sheweth,<br>
<br>
    Though the Petitioner swore, stamped, and threw down his Cards, he
    has all imaginable Respect for the Ladies, and the whole Company.<br>
<br>
    That he humbly de<b>Sir</b> es it may be considered in the Case of Gaming,
    there are many Motives which provoke to Disorder.<br>
<br>
    That the De<b>Sir</b> e of Gain, and the De<b>Sir</b> e of Victory, are both
    thwarted in Losing.<br>
<br>
    That all Conversations in the World have indulged Human Infirmity in
    this Case.<br>
<br>
    Your Petitioner therefore most humbly prays, that he may be restored
    to the Company, and he hopes to bear ill Fortune with a good Grace
    for the future, and to demean himself so as to be no more than
    chearful when he wins, than grave when he loses. </blockquote></blockquote>

  <i><b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  As you are Spectator-General, you may with Authority censure
  whatsoever looks ill, and is offensive to the Sight; the worst Nusance
  of which kind, methinks, is the scandalous Appearance of Poor in all
  Parts of this wealthy City. Such miserable Objects affect the
  compassionate Beholder with dismal Ideas, discompose the Chearfulness
  of his Mind, and deprive him of the Pleasure that he might otherwise
  take in surveying the Grandeur of our Metropolis. Who can without
  Remorse see a disabled Sailor, the Purveyor of our Luxury, destitute
  of Necessaries? Who can behold an honest Soldier, that bravely
  withstood the Enemy, prostrate and in Want amongst his Friends? It
  were endless to mention all the Variety of Wretchedness, and the
  numberless Poor, that not only singly, but in Companies, implore your
  Charity. Spectacles of this Nature every where occur; and it is
  unaccountable, that amongst the many lamentable Cries that infest this
  Town, your Comptroller-General should not take notice of the most
  shocking, <i>viz</i>. those of the Needy and Afflicted. I can't but think
  he wav'd it meerly out of good Breeding, chusing rather to stifle his
  Resentment, than upbraid his Countrymen with Inhumanity; however, let
  not Charity be sacrificed to Popularity, and if his Ears were deaf to
  their Complaints, let not your Eyes overlook their Persons. There are,
  I know, many Impostors among them. Lameness and Blindness are
  certainly very often acted; but can those that have their Sight and
  Limbs, employ them better than in knowing whether they are
  counterfeited or not? I know not which of the two misapplies his
  Senses most, he who pretends himself blind to move Compassion, or he
  who beholds a miserable Object without pitying it. But in order to
  remove such Impediments, I wish, Mr. SPECTATOR, you would give us a
  Discourse upon Beggars, that we may not pass by true Objects of
  Charity, or give to Impostors. I looked out of my Window the other
  Morning earlier than ordinary, and saw a blind Beggar, an Hour before
  the Passage he stands in is frequented, with a Needle and Thread,
  thriftily mending his Stockings: My Astonishment was still greater,
  when I beheld a lame Fellow, whose Legs were too big to walk within an
  Hour after, bring him a Pot of Ale. I will not mention the Shakings,
  Distortions, and Convulsions which many of them practise to gain an
  Alms; but sure I am, they ought to be taken Care of in this Condition,
  either by the Beadle or the Magistrate. They, it seems, relieve their
  Posts according to their Talents. There is the Voice of an old Woman
  never begins to beg 'till nine in the Evening, and then she is
  destitute of Lodging, turned out for want of Rent, and has the same
  ill Fortune every Night in the Year. You should employ an Officer to
  hear the Distress of each Beggar that is constant at a particular
  Place, who is ever in the same Tone, and succeeds because his Audience
  is continually changing, tho' he does not alter his Lamentation. If we
  have nothing else for our Money, let us have more Invention to be
  cheated with. All which is submitted to your Spectatorial Vigilance:

  I was last <i>Sunday</i> highly transported at our Parish-Church; the
  Gentleman in the Pulpit pleaded movingly in Behalf of the poor
  Children, and they for themselves much more forcibly by singing an
  Hymn; And I had the Happiness to be a Contributor to this little
  religious Institution of Innocents, and am sure I never disposed of
  Money more to my Satisfaction and Advantage. The inward Joy I find in
  my self, and the Good-will I bear to Mankind, make me heartily wish
  those pious Works may be encouraged, that the present Promoters may
  reap the Delight, and Posterity the Benefit of them. But whilst we are
  building this beautiful Edifice, let not the old Ruins remain in View
  to sully the Prospect: Whilst we are cultivating and improving this
  young hopeful Offspring, let not the ancient and helpless Creatures be
  shamefully neglected. The Crowds of Poor, or pretended Poor, in every
  Place, are a great Reproach to us, and eclipse the Glory of all other
  Charity. It is the utmost Reproach to Society, that there should be a
  poor Man unrelieved, or a poor Rogue unpunished. I hope you will think
  no Part of Human Life out of your Consideration, but will, at your
  Leisure, give us the History of Plenty and Want, and the natural
  Gradations towards them, calculated for the Cities of <i>London</i> and
  <i>Westminster</i>.<br>

  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  I beg you would be pleased to take Notice of a very great Indecency,
  which is extreamly common, though, I think, never yet under your
  Censure. It is, <b>Sir</b> , the strange Freedoms some ill-bred married People
  take in Company: The unseasonable Fondness of some Husbands, and the
  ill-timed Tenderness of some Wives. They talk and act, as if Modesty
  was only fit for Maids and Batchelors, and that too before both. I was
  once, Mr. SPECTATOR, where the Fault I speak of was so very flagrant,
  that (being, you must know, a very bashful Fellow, and several young
  Ladies in the Room) I protest I was quite out of Countenance.
  <i>Lucina</i>, it seems, was breeding, and she did nothing but entertain
  the Company with a Discourse upon the Difficulty of Reckoning to a
  Day, and said she knew those who were certain to an Hour; then fell a
  laughing at a silly unexperienced Creature, who was a Month above her
  Time. Upon her Husband's coming in, she put several Questions to him;
  which he not caring to resolve, Well, cries <i>Lucina</i>, I shall have 'em
  all at Night&mdash;But lest I should seem guilty of the very Fault I write
  against, I shall only intreat <i>Mr</i>. <b>Spectator</b> to correct such

I have lately been casting in my Thoughts the several Unhappinesses of
Life, and comparing the Infelicities of old Age to those of Infancy. The
Calamities of Children are due to the Negligence and Misconduct of
Parents, those of Age to the past Life which led to it. I have here the
History of a Boy and Girl to their Wedding-Day, and I think I cannot
give the Reader a livelier Image of the insipid way which Time
uncultivated passes, than by entertaining him with their authentick
Epistles, expressing all that was remarkable in their Lives, 'till the
Period of their Life above mentioned. The Sentence at the Head of this
Paper, which is only a warm Interrogation, <i>What is there in Nature so
dear as a Man's own Children to him?</i> is all the Reflection I shall at
present make on those who are negligent or cruel in the Education of
them.<br>

<br>
  I am now entring into my One and Twentieth Year, and do not know that
  I had one Day's thorough Satisfaction since I came to Years of any
  Reflection, till the Time they say others lose their Liberty, the Day
  of my Marriage. I am Son to a Gentleman of a very great Estate, who
  resolv'd to keep me out of the Vices of the Age; and in order to it
  never let me see any Thing that he thought could give me the least
  Pleasure. At ten Years old I was put to a Grammar-School, where my
  Master received Orders every Post to use me very severely, and have no
  regard to my having a great Estate. At Fifteen I was removed to the
  University, where I liv'd, out of my Father's great Discretion, in
  scandalous Poverty and Want, till I was big enough to be married, and
  I was sent for to see the Lady who sends you the Underwritten. When we
  were put together, we both considered that we could not be worse than
  we were in taking one another, out of a De<b>Sir</b> e of Liberty entered into
  Wedlock. My Father says I am now a Man, and may speak to him like
  another Gentleman.<br>

  <i>Mr</i>. SPEC.<br>
<br>
  I grew tall and wild at my Mother's, who is a gay Widow, and did not
  care for shewing me 'till about two Years and a half ago; at which
  time my Guardian Uncle sent me to a Boarding-School, with Orders to
  contradict me in nothing, for I had been misused enough already. I had
  not been there above a Month, when being in the Kitchin, I saw some
  Oatmeal on the Dresser; I put two or three Corns in my Mouth, liked
  it, stole a Handful, went into my Chamber, chewed it, and for two
  Months after never failed taking Toll of every Pennyworth of Oatmeal
  that came into the House: But one Day playing with a Tobacco-pipe
  between my Teeth, it happened to break in my Mouth, and the spitting
  out the Pieces left such a delicious Roughness on my Tongue, that I
  could not be satisfied 'till I had champed up the remaining Part of
  the Pipe. I forsook the Oatmeal, and stuck to the Pipes three Months,
  in which Time I had dispensed with thirty seven foul Pipes, all to the
  Boles; They belonged to an old Gentleman, Father to my Governess&mdash;He
  lock'd up the clean ones. I left off eating of Pipes, and fell to
  licking of Chalk. I was soon tired of this; I then nibbled all the red
  Wax of our last Ball-Tickets, and three Weeks after the black Wax from
  the Burying-Tickets of the old Gentleman. Two Months after this I
  liv'd upon Thunder-bolts, a certain long, round bluish Stone, which I
  found among the Gravel in our Garden. I was wonderfully delighted with
  this; but Thunder-bolts growing scarce, I fasten'd Tooth and Nail upon
  our Garden-Wall, which I stuck to almost a Twelvemonth, and had in
  that time peeled and devoured half a Foot towards our Neighbour's
  Yard. I now thought my self the happiest Creature in the World, and I
  believe in my Conscience, I had eaten quite through, had I had it in
  my Chamber; but now I became lazy, and unwilling to stir, and was
  obliged to seek Food nearer Home. I then took a strange Hankering to
  Coals; I fell to scranching 'em, and had already consumed, I am
  certain, as much as would have dressed my Wedding Dinner, when my
  Uncle came for me Home. He was in the Parlour with my Governess when I
  was called down. I went in, fell on my Knees, for he made me call him
  Father; and when I expected the Blessing I asked, the good Gentleman,
  in a Surprize, turns himself to my Governess, and asks, Whether this
  (pointing to me) was his Daughter? This (added he) is the very Picture
  of Death. My Child was a plump-fac'd, hale, fresh-coloured Girl; but
  this looks as if she was half-starved, a mere Skeleton. My Governess,
  who is really a good Woman, assured my Father I had wanted for
  nothing; and withal told him I was continually eating some Trash or
  other, and that I was almost eaten up with the Green-sickness, her
  Orders being never to cross me. But this magnified but little with my
  Father, who presently, in a kind of Pett, paying for my Board, took me
  home with him. I had not been long at home, but one <i>Sunday</i> at Church
  (I shall never forget it) I saw a young neighbouring Gentleman that
  pleased me hugely; I liked him of all Men I ever saw in my Life, and
  began to wish I could be as pleasing to him. The very next Day he
  came, with his Father, a visiting to our House: We were left alone
  together, with Directions on both Sides to be in Love with one
  another, and in three Weeks time we were married. I regained my former
  Health and Complexion, and am now as happy as the Day is long. Now,
  <i>Mr</i>. SPEC., I de<b>Sir</b> e you would find out some Name for these craving
  Damsels, whether dignified or distinguished under some or all of the
  following Denominations, (to wit) <i>Trash-eaters, Oatmeal-chewers,
  Pipe-champers, Chalk-lickers, Wax-nibbles, Coal-Scranchers,
  Wall-peelers</i>, or <i>Gravel-diggers</i>: And, good <b>Sir</b> , do your utmost
  endeavour to prevent (by exposing) this unaccountable Folly, so
  prevailing among the young ones of our Sex, who may not meet with such
  sudden good Luck as,<br>

<br>
  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  According to a late Invitation in one of your Papers to every Man who
  pleases to write, I have sent you the following short Dissertation
  against the Vice of being prejudiced.<br>
<br>
  <i>Your most humble Servant</i>.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
  Man is a sociable Creature, and a Lover of Glory; whence it is that
  when several Persons are united in the same Society, they are studious
  to lessen the Reputation of others, in order to raise their own. The
  Wise are content to guide the Springs in Silence, and rejoice in
  Secret at their regular Progress: To prate and triumph is the Part
  allotted to the Trifling and Superficial: The Geese were
  providentially ordained to save the <i>Capitol</i>. Hence it is, that the
  Invention of Marks and Devices to distinguish Parties, is owing to the
  <i>Beaux</i> and <i>Belles</i> of this Island. Hats moulded into different Cocks
  and Pinches, have long bid mutual Defiance; Patches have been set
  against Patches in Battel-aray; Stocks have risen or fallen in
  Proportion to Head-Dresses; and Peace or War been expected, as the
  <i>White</i> or the <i>Red</i> Hood hath prevailed. These are the
  Standard-Bearers in our contending Armies, the Dwarfs and Squires who
  carry the Impresses of the Giants or Knights, not born to fight
  themselves, but to prepare the Way for the ensuing Combat.<br>
<br>
  It is Matter of Wonder to reflect how far Men of weak Understanding
  and strong Fancy are hurried by their Prejudices, even to the
  believing that the whole Body of the adverse Party are a Band of
  Villains and D&aelig;mons. Foreigners complain, that the <i>English</i> are the
  proudest Nation under Heaven. Perhaps they too have their Share; but
  be that as it will, general Charges against Bodies of Men is the Fault
  I am writing against. It must be own'd, to our Shame, that our common
  People, and most who have not travelled, have an irrational Contempt
  for the Language, Dress, Customs, and even the Shape and Minds of
  other Nations. Some Men otherwise of Sense, have wondered that a great
  Genius should spring out of <i>Ireland</i>; and think you mad in affirming,
  that fine Odes have been written in <i>Lapland</i>.<br>
<br>
  This Spirit of Rivalship, which heretofore reigned in the Two
  Universities, is extinct, and almost over betwixt College and College:
  In Parishes and Schools the Thirst of Glory still obtains. At the
  Seasons of Football and Cock-fighting, these little Republicks
  reassume their national Hatred to each other. My Tenant in the Country
  is verily perswaded, that the Parish of the Enemy hath not one honest
  Man in it.<br>
<br>
  I always hated Satyrs against Woman, and Satyrs against Man; I am apt
  to suspect a Stranger who laughs at the Religion of <i>The Faculty</i>; My
  Spleen rises at a dull Rogue, who is severe upon Mayors and Aldermen;
  and was never better pleased than with a Piece of Justice executed
  upon the Body of a Templer, who was very arch upon Parsons.<br>
<br>
  The Necessities of Mankind require various Employments; and whoever
  excels in his Province is worthy of Praise. All Men are not educated
  after the same Manner, nor have all the same Talents. Those who are
  deficient deserve our Compassion, and have a Title to our Assistance.
  All cannot be bred in the same Place; but in all Places there arise,
  at different Times, such Persons as do Honour to their Society, which
  may raise Envy in little Souls, but are admired and cherished by
  generous Spirits.<br>
<br>
  It is certainly a great Happiness to be educated in Societies of great
  and eminent Men. Their Instructions and Examples are of extraordinary
  Advantage. It is highly proper to instill such a Reverence of the
  governing Persons, and Concern for the Honour of the Place, as may
  spur the growing Members to worthy Pursuits and honest Emulation: But
  to swell young Minds with vain Thoughts of the Dignity of their own
  Brotherhood, by debasing and villifying all others, doth them a real
  Injury. By this means I have found that their Efforts have become
  languid, and their Prattle irksome, as thinking it sufficient Praise
  that they are Children of so illustrious and ample a Family. I should
  think it a surer as well as more generous Method, to set before the
  Eyes of Youth such Persons as have made a noble Progress in
  Fraternities less talk'd of; which seems tacitly to reproach their
  Sloth, who loll so heavily in the Seats of mighty Improvement: Active
  Spirits hereby would enlarge their Notions, whereas by a servile
  Imitation of one, or perhaps two, admired Men in their own Body, they
  can only gain a secondary and derivative kind of Fame. These Copiers
  of Men, like those of Authors or Painters, run into Affectations of
  some Oddness, which perhaps was not disagreeable in the Original, but
  sits ungracefully on the narrow-soul'd Transcriber.<br>
<br>
  By such early Corrections of Vanity, while Boys are growing into Men,
  they will gradually learn not to censure superficially; but imbibe
  those Principles of general Kindness and Humanity, which alone can
  make them easie to themselves, and beloved by others.<br>
<br>
  Reflections of this nature have expunged all Prejudices out of my
  Heart, insomuch that, tho' I am a firm Protestant, I hope to see the
  Pope and Cardinals without violent Emotions; and tho' I am naturally
  grave, I expect to meet good Company at <i>Paris</i>.<br>

<br>

The Moral World, as consisting of Males and Females, is of a mixt
Nature, and filled with several Customs, Fashions and Ceremonies, which
would have no place in it, were there but <i>One</i> Sex. Had our Species no
Females in it, Men would be quite different Creatures from what they are
at present; their Endeavours to please the opposite Sex, polishes and
refines them out of those Manners which are most Natural to them, and
often sets them upon modelling themselves, not according to the Plans
which they approve in their own Opinions, but according to those Plans
which they think are most agreeable to the Female World. In a Word, Man
would not only be unhappy, but a rude unfinished Creature, were he
conversant with none but those of his own Make.<br>
<br>
Women, on the other side, are apt to form themselves in every thing with
regard to that other half of reasonable Creatures, with whom they are
here blended and confused; their Thoughts are ever turned upon appearing
amiable to the other Sex; they talk, and move, and smile, with a Design
upon us; every Feature of their Faces, every part of their Dress is
filled with Snares and Allurements. There would be no such Animals as
Prudes or Coquets in the World, were there not such an Animal as Man. In
short, it is the Male that gives Charms to Womankind, that produces an
Air in their Faces, a Grace in their Motions, a Softness in their
Voices, and a Delicacy in their Complections.<br>
<br>
As this mutual Regard between the two Sexes tends to the Improvement of
each of them, we may observe that Men are apt to degenerate into rough
and brutal Natures, who live as if there were no such things as Women in
the World; as on the contrary, Women, who have an Indifference or
Aversion for their Counter-parts in human Nature, are generally Sower
and Unamiable, Sluttish and Censorious.<br>
<br>
I am led into this Train of Thoughts by a little Manuscript which is
lately fallen into my Hands, and which I shall communicate to the
Reader, as I have done some other curious Pieces of the same Nature,
without troubling him with any Enquiries about the Author of it. It
contains a summary Account of two different States which bordered upon
one another. The one was a Commonwealth of <i>Amazons</i>, or Women without
Men; the other was a Republick of Males that had not a Woman in their
whole Community. As these two States bordered upon one another, it was
their way, it seems, to meet upon their Frontiers at a certain Season of
the Year, where those among the Men who had not made their Choice in any
former Meeting, associated themselves with particular Women, whom they
were afterwards obliged to look upon as their Wives in every one of
these yearly Rencounters. The Children that sprung from this Alliance,
if Males, were sent to their respective Fathers, if Females, continued
with their Mothers. By means of this Anniversary Carnival, which lasted
about a Week, the Commonwealths were recruited from time to time, and
supplied with their respective Subjects.<br>
<br>
These two States were engaged together in a perpetual League, Offensive
and Defensive, so that if any Foreign Potentate offered to attack either
of them, both the Sexes fell upon him at once, and quickly brought him
to Reason. It was remarkable that for many Ages this Agreement continued
inviolable between the two States, notwithstanding, as was said before,
they were Husbands and Wives; but this will not appear so wonderful, if
we consider that they did not live together above a Week in a Year.<br>
<br>
In the Account which my Author gives of the Male Republick, there were
several Customs very remarkable. The Men never shaved their Beards, or
pared their Nails above once in a Twelvemonth, which was probably about
the time of the great annual Meeting upon their Frontiers. I find the
Name of a Minister of State in one Part of their History, who was fined
for appearing too frequently in clean Linnen; and of a certain great
General who was turned out of his Post for Effeminacy, it having been
proved upon him by several credible Witnesses that he washed his Face
every Morning. If any Member of the Commonwealth had a soft Voice, a
smooth Face, or a supple Behaviour, he was banished into the
Commonwealth of Females, where he was treated as a Slave, dressed in
Petticoats, and set a Spinning. They had no Titles of Honour among them,
but such as denoted some Bodily Strength or Perfection, as such an one
<i>the Tall</i>, such an one <i>the Stocky</i>, such an one <i>the Gruff</i>. Their
publick Debates were generally managed with Kicks and Cuffs, insomuch
that they often came from the Council Table with broken Shins, black
Eyes, and bloody Noses. When they would reproach a Man in the most
bitter Terms, they would tell him his Teeth were white, or that he had a
fair Skin, and a soft Hand. The greatest Man I meet with in their
History, was one who could lift Five hundred Weight, and wore such a
prodigious Pair of Whiskers as had never been seen in the Commonwealth
before his Time. These Accomplishments it seems had rendred him so
popular, that if he had not died very seasonably, it is thought he might
have enslaved the Republick. Having made this short Extract out of the
History of the Male Commonwealth, I shall look into the History of the
neighbouring State which consisted of Females, and if I find any thing
in it, will not fail to Communicate it to the Publick.<br>

<br>

Having carefully perused the Manuscript I mentioned in my Yesterday's
Paper, so far as it relates to the Republick of Women, I find in it
several Particulars which may very well deserve the Reader's Attention.<br>
<br>
The Girls of Quality, from six to twelve Years old, were put to publick
Schools, where they learned to Box and play at Cudgels, with several
other Accomplishments of the same Nature; so that nothing was more usual
than to see a little Miss returning Home at Night with a broken Pate, or
two or three Teeth knocked out of her Head. They were afterwards taught
to ride the great Horse, to Shoot, Dart, or Sling, and listed into
several Companies, in order to perfect themselves in Military Exercises.
No Woman was to be married till she had killed her Man. The Ladies of
Fashion used to play with young Lions instead of Lap-dogs, and when they
made any Parties of Diversion, instead of entertaining themselves at
Ombre or Piquet, they would wrestle and pitch the Bar for a whole
Afternoon together. There was never any such thing as a Blush seen, or a
Sigh heard, in the Commonwealth. The Women never dressed but to look
terrible, to which end they would sometimes after a Battel paint their
Cheeks with the Blood of their Enemies. For this Reason likewise the
Face which had the most Scars was looked upon as the most beautiful. If
they found Lace, Jewels, Ribbons, or any Ornaments in Silver or Gold
among the Booty which they had taken, they used to dress their Horses
with it, but never entertained a Thought of wearing it themselves. There
were particular Rights and Privileges allowed to any Member of the
Commonwealth, who was a Mother of three Daughters. The Senate was made
up of old Women; for by the Laws of the Country none was to be a
Councellor of State that was not past Child-bearing. They used to boast
their Republick had continued Four thousand Years, which is altogether
improbable, unless we may suppose, what I am very apt to think, that
they measured their Time by <i>Lunar</i> Years.<br>
<br>
There was a great Revolution brought about in this Female Republick, by
means of a neighbouring King, who had made War upon them several Years
with various Success, and at length overthrew them in a very great
Battel. This Defeat they ascribe to several Causes; some say that the
Secretary of State having been troubled with the Vapours, had committed
some fatal Mistakes in several Dispatches about that Time. Others
pretend, that the first Minister being big with Child, could not attend
the Publick Affairs, as so great an Exigency of State required; but this
I can give no manner of Credit to, since it seems to contradict a
Fundamental Maxim in their Government which I have before mentioned. My
Author gives the most probable Reason of this great Disaster; for he
affirms, that the General was brought to Bed, or (as others say)
Miscarried the very Night before the Battel: However it was, this signal
Overthrow obliged them to call in the Male Republick to their
Assistance; but notwithstanding their Common Efforts to repulse the
Victorious Enemy, the War continued for many Years before they could
entirely bring it to a happy Conclusion.<br>
<br>
The Campaigns which both Sexes passed together made them so well
acquainted with one another, that at the End of the War they did not
care for parting. In the Beginning of it they lodged in separate Camps,
but afterwards as they grew more familiar, they pitched their Tents
promiscuously.<br>
<br>
From this time the Armies being Chequered with both Sexes, they polished
apace. The Men used to invite their Fellow-Soldiers into their Quarters,
and would dress their Tents with Flowers and Boughs, for their
Reception. If they chanced to like one more than another, they would be
cutting her Name in the Table, or Chalking out her Figure upon a Wall,
or talking of her in a kind of rapturous Language, which by degrees
improved into Verse and Sonnet. These were as the first Rudiments of
Architecture, Painting, and Poetry among this Savage People. After any
Advantage over the Enemy, both Sexes used to Jump together and make a
Clattering with their Swords and Shields, for Joy, which in a few Years
produced several Regular Tunes and Sett Dances.<br>
<br>
As the two Armies romped on these Occasions, the Women complained of the
thick bushy Beards and long Nails of their Confederates, who thereupon
took care to prune themselves into such Figures as were most pleasing to
their Female Friends and Allies.<br>
<br>
When they had taken any Spoils from the Enemy, the Men would make a
Present of every thing that was Rich and Showy to the Women whom they
most admired, and would frequently dress the Necks, or Heads, or Arms of
their Mistresses, with any thing which they thought appeared Gay or
Pretty. The Women observing that the Men took delight in looking upon
them, when they were adorned with such Trappings and Gugaws, set their
Heads at Work to find out new Inventions, and to outshine one another in
all Councils of War or the like solemn Meetings. On the other hand, the
Men observing how the Women's Hearts were set upon Finery, begun to
Embellish themselves and look as agreeably as they could in the Eyes of
their Associates. In short, after a few Years conversing together, the
Women had learnt to Smile, and the Men to Ogle, the Women grew Soft, and
the Men Lively.<br>
<br>
When they had thus insensibly formed one another, upon the finishing of
the War, which concluded with an entire Conquest of their common Enemy,
the Colonels in one Army Married the Colonels in the other; the Captains
in the same Manner took the Captains to their Wives: The whole Body of
common Soldiers were matched, after the Example of their Leaders. By
this means the two Republicks incorporated with one another, and became
the most Flourishing and Polite Government in the Part of the World
which they Inhabited.<br>

<br>

Most of the Papers I give the Publick are written on Subjects that never
vary, but are for ever fixt and immutable. Of this kind are all my more
serious Essays and Discourses; but there is another sort of
Speculations, which I consider as Occasional Papers, that take their
Rise from the Folly, Extravagance, and Caprice of the present Age. For I
look upon my self as one set to watch the Manners and Behaviour of my
Countrymen and Contemporaries, and to mark down every absurd Fashion,
ridiculous Custom, or affected Form of Speech that makes its Appearance
in the World, during the Course of these my Speculations. The Petticoat
no sooner begun to swell, but I observed its Motions. The Party-patches
had not time to muster themselves before I detected them. I had
Intelligence of the Coloured Hood the very first time it appeared in a
Publick Assembly. I might here mention several other the like Contingent
Subjects, upon which I have bestowed distinct Papers. By this Means I
have so effectually quashed those Irregularities which gave Occasion to
'em, that I am afraid Posterity will scarce have a sufficient Idea of
them, to relish those Discourses which were in no little Vogue at the
time when they were written. They will be apt to think that the Fashions
and Customs I attacked were some Fantastick Conceits of my own, and that
their Great-Grand-mothers could not be so whimsical as I have
represented them. For this Reason, when I think on the Figure my several
Volumes of Speculations will make about a Hundred Years hence, I
consider them as so many Pieces of old Plate, where the Weight will be
regarded, but the Fashion lost.<br>
<br>
Among the several Female Extravagancies I have already taken Notice of,
there is one which still keeps its Ground. I mean that of the Ladies who
dress themselves in a Hat and Feather, a Riding-coat and a Perriwig, or
at least tie up their Hair in a Bag or Ribbond, in imitation of the
smart Part of the opposite Sex. As in my Yesterday's Paper I gave an
Account of the Mixture of two Sexes in one Commonwealth, I shall here
take notice of this Mixture of two Sexes in one Person. I have already
shewn my Dislike of this Immodest Custom more than once; but in Contempt
of every thing I have hitherto said, I am informed that the Highways
about this great City are still very much infested with these Female
Cavaliers.<br>
<br>
I remember when I was at my Friend <b>Sir</b>  <b>Roger De Coverly's</b> about this
time Twelve-month, an Equestrian Lady of this Order appeared upon the
Plains which lay at a distance from his House. I was at that time
walking in the Fields with my old Friend; and as his Tenants ran out on
every side to see so strange a Sight, <b>Sir</b>  ROGER asked one of them who
came by us what it was? To which the Country Fellow reply'd, 'Tis a
Gentlewoman, saving your Worship's Presence, in a Coat and Hat. This
produced a great deal of Mirth at the Knight's House, where we had a
Story at the same time of another of his Tenants, who meeting this
Gentleman-like Lady on the High-way, was asked by her <i>whether that was</i>
Coverly-Hall, the Honest Man seeing only the Male Part of the Querist,
replied, <i>Yes, <b>Sir</b> </i>; but upon the second Question, <i>whether</i> <b>Sir</b>  <b>Roger
De Coverly</b> <i>was a married Man</i>, having dropped his Eye upon the
Petticoat, he changed his Note into <i>No, Madam</i>.<br>
<br>
Had one of these Hermaphrodites appeared in <i>Juvenal's</i> Days, with what
an Indignation should we have seen her described by that excellent
Satyrist. He would have represented her in a Riding Habit, as a greater
Monster than the Centaur. He would have called for Sacrifices or
Purifying Waters, to expiate the Appearance of such a Prodigy. He would
have invoked the Shades of <i>Portia</i> or <i>Lucretia</i>, to see into what the
<i>Roman</i> Ladies had transformed themselves.<br>
<br>
For my own part, I am for treating the Sex with greater Tenderness, and
have all along made use of the most gentle Methods to bring them off
from any little Extravagance into which they are sometimes unwarily
fallen: I think it however absolutely necessary to keep up the Partition
between the two Sexes, and to take Notice of the smallest Encroachments
which the one makes upon the other. I hope therefore that I shall not
hear any more Complaints on this Subject. I am sure my She-Disciples who
peruse these my daily Lectures, have profited but little by them, if
they are capable of giving into such an Amphibious Dress. This I should
not have mentioned, had not I lately met one of these my Female Readers
in <i>Hyde Park</i>, who looked upon me with a masculine Assurance, and
cocked her Hat full in my Face.<br>
<br>
For my part, I have one general Key to the Behaviour of the Fair Sex.
When I see them singular in any Part of their Dress, I conclude it is
not without some Evil Intention; and therefore question not but the
Design of this strange Fashion is to smite more effectually their Male
Beholders. Now to set them right in this Particular, I would fain have
them consider with themselves whether we are not more likely to be
struck by a Figure entirely Female, than with such an one as we may see
every Day in our Glasses: Or, if they please, let them reflect upon
their own Hearts, and think how they would be affected should they meet
a Man on Horseback, in his Breeches and Jack-Boots, and at the same time
dressed up in a Commode and a Night-raile.<br>
<br>
I must observe that this Fashion was first of all brought to us from
<i>France</i>, a Country which has Infected all the Nations of <i>Europe</i> with
its Levity. I speak not this in derogation of a whole People, having
more than once found fault with those general Reflections which strike
at Kingdoms or Commonwealths in the Gross: A piece of Cruelty, which an
ingenious Writer of our own compares to that of <i>Caligula</i>, who wished
the <i>Roman</i> People had all but one Neck, that he might behead them at a
Blow. I shall therefore only Remark, that as Liveliness and Assurance
are in a peculiar manner the Qualifications of the <i>French</i> Nation, the
same Habits and Customs will not give the same Offence to that People,
which they produce among those of our own Country. Modesty is our
distinguishing Character, as Vivacity is theirs: And when this our
National Virtue appears in that Female Beauty, for which our <i>British</i>
Ladies are celebrated above all others in the Universe, it makes up the
most amiable Object that the Eye of Man can possibly behold.<br>

<br>

Being a Person of insatiable Curiosity, I could not forbear going on
<i>Wednesday</i> last to a Place of no small Renown for the Gallantry of the
lower Order of <i>Britons</i>, <a name="fr4361">namely</a>, to the Bear-Garden at <i>Hockley in the
Hole</i><a href="#f4361"><sup>1</sup></a>; where (as a whitish brown Paper, put into my Hands in the
Street, informed me) there was to be a Tryal of Skill to be exhibited
between two Masters of the Noble Science of Defence, at two of the Clock
precisely. I was not a little charm'd with the Solemnity of the
Challenge, which ran thus:

<blockquote>  <i>I</i> James Miller, <i>Serjeant, (lately come from the Frontiers of</i>
  Portugal) <i>Master of the noble Science of Defence, hearing in most
  Places where I have been of the great Fame of</i> Timothy Buck <i>of</i>
  London, <i>Master of the said Science, do invite him to meet me, and
  exercise at the several Weapons following</i>, viz.<br>
<br>

</table></blockquote>

If the generous Ardour in <i>James Miller</i> to dispute the Reputation of
<i>Timothy Buck</i>, had something resembling the old Heroes of Romance,
<i>Timothy Buck</i> return'd Answer in the same Paper with the like Spirit,
adding a little Indignation at being challenged, and seeming to
condescend to fight <i>James Miller</i>, <a name="fr4362">not</a> in regard to <i>Miller</i> himself,
but in that, as the Fame went out, he had fought <i>Parkes</i> of <i>Coventry</i><a href="#f4362"><sup>2</sup></a>. The Acceptance of the Combat ran in these Words:

<blockquote>  <i>I</i> Timothy Buck <i>of</i> Clare-Market, <i>Master of the Noble Science of
  Defence, hearing he did fight Mr.</i> Parkes <i>of</i> Coventry, <i>will not
  fail (God Willing) to meet this fair Inviter at the Time and Place
  appointed, de<b>Sir</b> ing a clear Stage and no Favour.</i><br>
<br>
  Vivat Regina.</blockquote>

I shall not here look back on the Spectacles of the <i>Greeks</i> and
<i>Romans</i> of this kind, but must believe this Custom took its rise from
the Ages of Knight-Errantry; from those who lov'd one Woman so well,
that they hated all Men and Women else; from those who would fight you,
whether you were or were not of their Mind; from those who demanded the
Combat of their Contemporaries, both for admiring their Mistress or
discommending her. I cannot therefore but lament, that the terrible Part
of the ancient Fight is preserved, when the amorous Side of it is
forgotten. We have retained the Barbarity, but lost the Gallantry of the
old Combatants. I could wish, methinks, these Gentlemen had consulted me
in the Promulgation of the Conflict. I was obliged by a fair young Maid
whom I understood to be called <i>Elizabeth Preston</i>, Daughter of the
Keeper of the Garden, with a Glass of Water; whom I imagined might have
been, for Form's sake, the general Representative of the Lady sought
for, and from her Beauty the proper <i>Amarillis</i> on these Occasions. It
would have ran better in the Challenge, <i>I</i> James Miller, <i>Serjeant, who
have travelled Parts abroad, and came last from the Frontiers of</i>
Portugal, <i>for the Love of</i> Elizabeth Preston, <i>do assert, That the
said</i> Elizabeth is the Fairest of Women. Then the Answer; <i>I</i> Timothy
Buck, <i>who have stay'd in</i> Great Britain <i>during all the War in Foreign
Parts, for the Sake of</i> Susanna Page, <i>do deny that</i> Elizabeth Preston
<i>is so fair as the said</i> Susanna Page. Let <i>Susanna Page</i> look on, and I
de<b>Sir</b> e of <i>James Miller</i> no Favour.<br>
<br>
This would give the Battel quite another Turn; and a proper Station for
the Ladies, whose Complexion was disputed by the Sword, would animate
the Disputants with a more gallant Incentive than the Expectation of
Money from the <b>Spectators</b>; tho' I would not have that neglected, but
thrown to that Fair One, whose Lover was approved by the Donor.<br>
<br>
Yet, considering the Thing wants such Amendments, it was carried with
great Order. <i>James Miller</i> came on first, preceded by two disabled
Drummers, to shew, I suppose, that the Prospect of maimed Bodies did not
in the least deter him. There ascended with the daring <i>Miller</i> a
Gentleman, whose Name I could not learn, with a dogged Air, as
unsatisfied that he was not Principal. This Son of Anger lowred at the
whole Assembly, and weighing himself as he march'd around from Side to
Side, with a stiff Knee and Shoulder, he gave Intimations of the Purpose
he smothered till he saw the Issue of this Encounter. <i>Miller</i> had a
blue Ribband tied round the Sword Arm; which Ornament I conceive to be
the Remain of that Custom of wearing a Mistress's Favour on such
Occasions of old.<br>
<br>
<i>Miller</i> is a Man of six Foot eight Inches Height, of a kind but bold
Aspect, well-fashioned, and ready of his Limbs: and such Readiness as
spoke his Ease in them, was obtained from a Habit of Motion in Military
Exercise.<br>
<br>
The Expectation of the <b>Spectators</b> was now almost at its Height, and the
Crowd pressing in, several active Persons thought they were placed
rather according to their Fortune than their Merit, and took it in their
Heads to prefer themselves from the open Area, or Pitt, to the
Galleries. This Dispute between Desert and Property brought many to the
Ground, and raised others in proportion to the highest Seats by Turns
for the Space of ten Minutes, till <i>Timothy Buck</i> came on, and the whole
Assembly giving up their Disputes, turned their Eyes upon the Champions.
Then it was that every Man's Affection turned to one or the other
irresistibly. A judicious Gentleman near me said, <i>I could methinks be</i>
Miller's <i>Second, but I had rather have</i> Buck <i>for mine</i>. <i>Miller</i> had
an Audacious Look, that took the Eye; <i>Buck</i> a perfect Composure, that
engaged the Judgment. <i>Buck</i> came on in a plain Coat, and kept all his
Air till the Instant of Engaging; at which time he undress'd to his
Shirt, his Arm adorned with a Bandage of red Ribband. No one can
describe the sudden Concern in the whole Assembly; the most tumultuous
Crowd in Nature was as still and as much engaged, as if all their Lives
depended on the first Blow. The Combatants met in the Middle of the
Stage, and shaking Hands as removing all Malice, they retired with much
Grace to the Extremities of it; from whence they immediately faced
about, and approached each other, <i>Miller</i> with an Heart full of
Resolution, <i>Buck</i> with a watchful untroubled Countenance; <i>Buck</i>
regarding principally his own Defence, <i>Miller</i> chiefly thoughtful of
annoying his Opponent. It is not easie to describe the many Escapes and
imperceptible Defences between two Men of quick Eyes and ready Limbs,
but <i>Miller's</i> Heat laid him open to the Rebuke of the calm <i>Buck</i>, by a
large Cut on the Forehead. Much Effusion of Blood covered his Eyes in a
Moment, and the Huzzas of the Crowd undoubtedly quickened the Anguish.
The Assembly was divided into Parties upon their different ways of
Fighting; while a poor Nymph in one of the Galleries apparently suffered
for <i>Miller</i>, and burst into a Flood of Tears. As soon as his Wound was
wrapped up, he came on again with a little Rage, which still disabled
him further. But what brave Man can be wounded into more Patience and
Caution? The next was a warm eager Onset, which ended in a decisive
Stroke on the Left Leg of <i>Miller</i>. The Lady in the Gallery, during this
second Strife, covered her Face; and for my Part, I could not keep my
Thoughts from being mostly employed on the Consideration of her unhappy
Circumstance that Moment, hearing the Clash of Swords, and apprehending
Life or Victory concerned her Lover in every Blow, but not daring to
satisfie her self on whom they fell. The Wound was exposed to the View
of all who could delight in it, and sowed up on the Stage. The surly
Second of <i>Miller</i> declared at this Time, that he would that Day
Fortnight fight Mr. <i>Buck</i> at the same Weapons, declaring himself the
Master of the renowned <i>Gorman</i>; but <i>Buck</i> denied him the Honour of
that couragious Disciple, and asserting that he himself had taught that
Champion, accepted the Challenge.<br>
<br>
There is something in Nature very unaccountable on such Occasions, when
we see the People take a certain painful Gratification in beholding
these Encounters. Is it Cruelty that administers this Sort of Delight?
Or is it a Pleasure which is taken in the Exercise of Pity? It was
methought pretty remarkable, that the Business of the Day being a Tryal
of Skill, the Popularity did not run so high as one would have expected
on the Side of <i>Buck</i>. Is it that People's Passions have their Rise in
Self-Love, and thought themselves (in spite of all the Courage they had)
liable to the Fate of <i>Miller</i>, but could not so easily think themselves
qualified like <i>Buck</i>?<br>
<br>
<i>Tully</i> <a name="fr4363">speaks</a> of this Custom with less Horrour than one would expect,
though he confesses it was much abused in his Time, and seems directly
to approve of it under its first Regulations, when Criminals only fought
before the People. <i>Crudele Gladiatorum spectaculum et inhumanum
nonnullis videri solet; et haud scio annon ita sit ut nunc fit; cum vero
sontes ferro depugnabant, auribus fortasse multa, oculis quidem nulla,
poterat esse fortior contra dolorem et mortem disciplina. The Shows of
Gladiators may be thought barbarous and inhumane, and I know not but it
is so as it is now practised; but in those Times when only Criminals
were Combatants, the Ear perhaps might receive many better Instructions,
but it is impossible that any thing which affects our Eyes, should
fortifie us so well against Pain and Death.</i> <a href="#f4363"><sup>3</sup></a><br>

The other Day passed by me in her Chariot a Lady with that pale and wan
Complexion, which we sometimes see in young People, who are fallen into
Sorrow and private Anxiety of Mind, which antedate Age and Sickness. It
is not three Years ago since she was gay, airy, and a little towards
Libertine in her Carriage; but, methought, I easily forgave her that
little Insolence, which she so severely pays for in her present
Condition. <i>Favilla</i>, of whom I am speaking, is married to a sullen Fool
with Wealth: Her Beauty and Merit are lost upon the Dolt, who is
insensible of Perfection in any thing. Their Hours together are either
painful or insipid: The Minutes she has to herself in his Absence, are
not sufficient to give Vent at her Eyes to the Grief and Torment of his
last Conversation. This poor Creature was sacrificed with a Temper
(which, under the Cultivation of a Man of Sense, would have made the
most agreeable Companion) into the Arms of this loathsome Yoak-fellow by
<i>Sempronia</i>. <i>Sempronia</i> is a good Lady, who supports herself in an
affluent Condition, by contracting Friendship with rich young Widows and
Maids of plentiful Fortunes at their own Disposal, and bestowing her
Friends upon worthless indigent Fellows; on the other Side, she ensnares
inconsiderate and rash Youths of great Estates into the Arms of vitious
Women. For this Purpose, she is accomplished in all the Arts which can
make her acceptable at impertinent Visits; she knows all that passes in
every Quarter, and is well acquainted with all the favourite Servants,
Busiebodies, Dependants, and poor Relations of all Persons of Condition
in the whole Town. At the Price of a good Sum of Money, <i>Sempronia</i>, by
the Instigation of <i>Favilla's</i> Mother, brought about the Match for the
Daughter, and the Reputation of this, which is apparently, in point of
Fortune, more than <i>Favilla</i> could expect, has gained her the Visits and
frequent Attendance of the Crowd of Mothers, who had rather see their
Children miserable in great Wealth, than the happiest of the Race of
Mankind in a less conspicuous State of Life. When <i>Sempronia</i> is so well
acquainted with a Woman's Temper and Circumstance, that she believes
Marriage would be acceptable to her, and advantageous to the Man who
shall get her; her next Step is to look out for some one, whose
Condition has some secret Wound in it, and wants a Sum, yet, in the Eye
of the World, not unsuitable to her. If such is not easily had, she
immediately adorns a worthless Fellow with what Estate she thinks
convenient, and adds as great a Share of good Humour and Sobriety as is
requisite: After this is settled, no Importunities, Arts, and Devices
are omitted to hasten the Lady to her Happiness. In the general indeed
she is a Person of so strict Justice, that she marries a poor Gallant to
a rich Wench, and a Moneyless Girl to a Man of Fortune. But then she has
no manner of Conscience in the Disparity, when she has a Mind to impose
a poor Rogue for one of an Estate, she has no Remorse in adding to it,
that he is illiterate, ignorant, and unfashioned; but makes those
Imperfections Arguments of the Truth of his Wealth, and will, on such an
Occasion, with a very grave Face, charge the People of Condition with
Negligence in the Education of their Children. Exception being made
t'other Day against an ignorant Booby of her own Cloathing, whom she was
putting off for a rich Heir, <i>Madam</i>, said she, <i>you know there is no
making Children who know they have Estates attend their Books.</i><br>
<br>
<i>Sempronia,</i> by these Arts, is loaded with Presents, importuned for her
Acquaintance, and admired by those who do not know the first Taste of
Life, as a Woman of exemplary good Breeding. But sure, to murder and to
rob are less Iniquities, than to raise Profit by Abuses, as irreparable
as taking away Life; but more grievous, as making it lastingly unhappy.
To rob a Lady at Play of Half her Fortune, is not so ill, as giving the
whole and her self to an unworthy Husband. But <i>Sempronia</i> can
administer Consolation to an unhappy Fair at Home, by leading her to an
agreeable Gallant elsewhere. She can then preach the general Condition
of all the Married World, and tell an unexperienced young Woman the
Methods of softning her Affliction, and laugh at her Simplicity and Want
of Knowledge, with an <i>Oh! my Dear, you will know better.</i><br>
<br>
The Wickedness of <i>Sempronia,</i> one would think, should be superlative;
but I cannot but esteem that of some Parents equal to it; I mean such as
sacrifice the greatest Endowments and Qualifications to base Bargains. A
Parent who forces a Child of a liberal and ingenious Spirit into the
Arms of a Clown or a Blockhead, obliges her to a Crime too odious for a
Name. It is in a Degree the unnatural Conjunction of rational and brutal
Beings. Yet what is there so common, as the bestowing an accomplished
Woman with such a Disparity. And I could name Crowds who lead miserable
Lives, or want of Knowledge in their Parents, of this Maxim, that good
Sense and good Nature always go together. That which is attributed to
Fools, and called good Nature, is only an Inability of observing what is
faulty, which turns in Marriage, into a Suspicion of every thing as
such, from a Consciousness of that Inability.<br>

It is a very common Expression, That such a one is very good-natur'd,
but very passionate. The Expression indeed is very good-natur'd, to
allow passionate People so much Quarter: But I think a passionate Man
deserves the least Indulgence Imaginable. It is said, it is soon over;
that is, all the Mischief he does is quickly dispatch'd, which, I think,
is no great Recommendation to Favour. I have known one of these
good-natur'd passionate Men say in a mix'd Company even to his own Wife
or Child, such Things as the most inveterate Enemy of his Family would
not have spoke, even in Imagination. It is certain that quick
Sensibility is inseparable from a ready Understanding; but why should
not that good Understanding call to it self all its Force on such
Occasions, to master that sudden Inclination to Anger. <a name="fr4381">One</a> of the
greatest Souls now in the World<a href="#f4381"><sup>1</sup></a> is the most subject by Nature to
Anger, and yet so famous from a Conquest of himself this Way, that he is
the known Example when you talk of Temper and Command of a Man's Self.
To contain the Spirit of Anger, is the worthiest Discipline we can put
our selves to. When a Man has made any Progress this way, a frivolous
Fellow in a Passion, is to him as contemptible as a froward Child. It
ought to be the Study of every Man, for his own Quiet and Peace. When he
stands combustible and ready to flame upon every thing that touches him,
Life is as uneasie to himself as it is to all about him. <i>Syncropius</i>
leads, of all Men living, the most ridiculous Life; he is ever
offending, and begging Pardon. If his Man enters the Room without what
he sent for, <i>That Blockhead</i>, begins he&mdash;<i>Gentlemen, I ask your
Pardon, but Servants now a-days</i>&mdash;The wrong Plates are laid, they are
thrown into the Middle of the Room; his Wife stands by in Pain for him,
which he sees in her Face, and answers as if he had heard all she was
thinking; <i>Why, what the Devil! Why don't you take Care to give Orders
in these things?</i> His Friends sit down to a tasteless Plenty of every
thing, every Minute expecting new Insults from his impertinent Passions.
In a Word, to eat with, or visit <i>Syncropius</i>, is no other than going to
see him exercise his Family, exercise their Patience, and his own Anger.<br>
<br>
It is monstrous that the Shame and Confusion in which this good-natured
angry Man must needs behold his Friends while he thus lays about him,
does not give him so much Reflection as to create an Amendment. This is
the most scandalous Disuse of Reason imaginable; all the harmless Part
of him is no more than that of a Bull-Dog, they are tame no longer than
they are not offended. One of these good-natured angry Men shall, in an
Instant, assemble together so many Allusions to secret Circumstances, as
are enough to dissolve the Peace of all the Families and Friends he is
acquainted with, in a Quarter of an Hour, and yet the next Moment be the
best-natured Man in the whole World. If you would see Passion in its
Purity, without Mixture of Reason, behold it represented in a mad Hero,
drawn by a mad Poet. <i>Nat Lee</i> makes his <i>Alexander</i> say thus:

<blockquote><i>Away, begon, and give a Whirlwind Room,<br>
Or I will blow you up like Dust! Avaunt;<br>
Madness but meanly represents my Toil.<br>
Eternal Discord!<br>
Fury! Revenge! Disdain and Indignation!<br>
Tear my swoln Breast, make way for Fire and Tempest.<br>
My Brain is burst, Debate and Reason quench'd;<br>
The Storm is up, and my hot bleeding Heart<br>
Splits with the Rack, while Passions, like the Wind,<br>
Rise up to Heav'n, and put out all the Stars.</i></blockquote>

Every passionate Fellow in Town talks half the Day with as little
Consistency, and threatens Things as much out of his Power.<br>
<br>
The next disagreeable Person to the outrageous Gentleman, is one of a
much lower Order of Anger, and he is what we commonly call a peevish
Fellow. A peevish Fellow is one who has some Reason in himself for being
out of Humour, or has a natural Incapacity for Delight, and therefore
disturbs all who are happier than himself with Pishes and Pshaws, or
other well-bred Interjections, at every thing that is said or done in
his Presence. There should be Physick mixed in the Food of all which
these Fellows eat in good Company. This Degree of Anger passes,
forsooth, for a Delicacy of Judgment, that won't admit of being easily
pleas'd: but none above the Character of wearing a peevish Man's Livery,
ought to bear with his ill Manners. All Things among Men of Sense and
Condition should pass the Censure, and have the Protection, of the Eye
of Reason.<br>
<br>
No Man ought to be tolerated in an habitual Humour, Whim, or
Particularity of Behaviour, by any who do not wait upon him for Bread.
Next to the peevish Fellow is the Snarler. This Gentleman deals mightily
in what we call the Irony, and as those sort of People exert themselves
most against these below them, you see their Humour best, in their Talk
to their Servants. <i>That is so like you, You are a fine Fellow, Thou art
the quickest Head-piece</i>, and the like. One would think the Hectoring,
the Storming, the Sullen, and all the different Species and
Subordinations of the Angry should be cured, by knowing they live only
as pardoned Men; and how pityful is the Condition of being only
suffered? But I am interrupted by the pleasantest Scene of Anger and the
Disappointment of it that I have ever known, which happened while I was
yet Writing, and I overheard as I sat in the Backroom at a <i>French</i>
Bookseller's. There came into the Shop a very learned Man with an erect
Solemn Air, and tho' a Person of great Parts otherwise, slow in
understanding anything which makes against himself. The Composure of the
faulty Man, and the whimsical Perplexity of him that was justly angry,
is perfectly New: After turning over many Volumes, said the Seller to
the Buyer, <i><b>Sir</b> , you know I have long asked you to send me back the
first Volume of French Sermons I formerly lent you;</i> <b>Sir</b> , said the
Chapman, I have often looked for it but cannot find it; It is certainly
lost, and I know not to whom I lent it, it is so many Years ago; <i>then,
<b>Sir</b> , here is the other Volume, I'll send you home that, and please to
pay for both</i>. My Friend, reply'd he, canst thou be so Senseless as not
to know that one Volume is as imperfect in my Library as in your Shop?
<i>Yes, <b>Sir</b> , but it is you have lost the first Volume, and to be short I
will be Paid.</i> <b>Sir</b> , answered the Chapman, you are a young Man, your Book
is lost, and learn by this little Loss to bear much greater Adversities,
which you must expect to meet with. <i>Yes, <b>Sir</b> , I'll bear when I must,
but I have not lost now, for I say you have it and shall pay me.</i>
Friend, you grow Warm, I tell you the Book is lost, and I foresee in the
Course even of a prosperous Life, that you will meet Afflictions to make
you Mad, if you cannot bear this Trifle. <i><b>Sir</b> , there is in this Case no
need of bearing, for you have the Book.</i> I say, <b>Sir</b> , I have not the
Book. But your Passion will not let you hear enough to be informed that
I have it not. Learn Resignation of your self to the Distresses of this
Life: Nay do not fret and fume, it is my Duty to tell you that you are
of an impatient Spirit, and an impatient Spirit is never without Woe.
<i>Was ever any thing like this?</i> Yes, <b>Sir</b> , there have been many things
like this. The Loss is but a Trifle, but your Temper is Wanton, and
incapable of the least Pain; therefore let me advise you, be patient,
the Book is lost, but do not you for that Reason lose your self.<br>

<blockquote><i>Hi narrata ferunt alio: mensuraque ficti<br>
Crescit; et auditis aliquid novus adjicit auctor.</i><br>
<br>
Ovid.<a href="transindex.html#439t"><img src="images/qmark.png" width="15" height="15" align="right" alt="translation"></a></blockquote><br>
<br>

<i>Ovid</i> <a name="fr4391">describes</a> the Palace of Fame<a href="#f4391"><sup>1</sup></a> as situated in the very Center of
the Universe, and perforated with so many Windows and Avenues as gave
her the Sight of every thing that was done in the Heavens, in the Earth,
and in the Sea. The Structure of it was contrived in so admirable a
manner, that it Eccho'd every Word which was spoken in the whole Compass
of Nature; so that the Palace, says the Poet, was always filled with a
confused Hubbub of low dying Sounds, the Voices being almost spent and
worn out before they arrived at this General Rendezvous of Speeches and
Whispers.<br>
<br>
I consider Courts with the same Regard to the Governments which they
superintend, as <i>Ovid's</i> Palace of Fame with regard to the Universe. The
Eyes of a watchful Minister run through the whole People. There is
scarce a Murmur or Complaint that does not reach his Ears. They have
News-gatherers and Intelligencers distributed into their several Walks
and Quarters, who bring in their respective Quotas, and make them
acquainted with the Discourse and Conversation of the whole Kingdom or
Common-wealth where they are employed. The wisest of Kings, alluding to
these invisible and unsuspected Spies, who are planted by Kings and
Rulers over their Fellow-Citizens, as well as to those Voluntary
Informers that are buzzing about the Ears of a great Man, and making
their Court by such secret Methods of Intelligence, has given us a very
prudent <a name="fr4392">Caution</a>: <i>Curse not the King, no not in thy Thought, and Curse
not the Rich in thy Bedchamber: For a Bird of the Air shall carry the
Voice, and that which hath Wings shall tell the matter.</i><a href="#f4392"><sup>2</sup></a><br>
<br>
As it is absolutely necessary for Rulers to make use of other People's
Eyes and Ears, they should take particular Care to do it in such a
manner, that it may not bear too hard on the Person whose Life and
Conversation are enquired into. A Man who is capable of so infamous a
Calling as that of a Spy, is not very much to be relied upon. He can
have no great Ties of Honour, or Checks of Conscience, to restrain him
in those covert Evidences, where the Person accused has no Opportunity
of vindicating himself. He will be more industrious to carry that which
is grateful, than that which is true.<br>
<br>
There will be no Occasion for him, if he does not hear and see things
worth Discovery; so that he naturally inflames every Word and
Circumstance, aggravates what is faulty, perverts what is good, and
misrepresents what is indifferent. Nor is it to be doubted but that such
ignominious Wretches let their private Passions into these their
clandestine Informations, and often wreck their particular Spite or
Malice against the Person whom they are set to watch. It is a pleasant
Scene enough, which an <i>Italian</i> Author describes between a Spy, and a
Cardinal who employed him. The Cardinal is represented as minuting down
every thing that is told him. The Spy begins with a low Voice, Such an
one, the Advocate, whispered to one of his Friends, within my Hearing,
that your Eminence was a very great Poultron; and after having given his
Patron time to take it down, adds that another called him a Mercenary
Rascal in a publick Conversation. The Cardinal replies, Very well, and
bids him go on. The Spy proceeds, and loads him with Reports of the same
Nature, till the Cardinal rises in great Wrath, calls him an impudent
Scoundrel, and kicks him out of the Room.<br>
<br>
It is observed of great and heroick Minds, that they have not only shewn
a particular Disregard to those unmerited Reproaches which have been
cast upon 'em, but have been altogether free from that Impertinent
Curiosity of enquiring after them, or the poor Revenge of resenting
them. The Histories of <i>Alexander</i> and <i>C&aelig;sar</i> are full of this kind of
Instances. Vulgar Souls are of a quite contrary Character. <i>Dionysius</i>,
the Tyrant of <i>Sicily</i>, had a Dungeon which was a very curious Piece of
Architecture; and of which, as I am informed, there are still to be seen
some Remains in that Island. It was called <i>Dionysius's</i> Ear, and built
with several little Windings and Labyrinths in the form of a real Ear.
The Structure of it made it a kind of whispering Place, but such a one
as gathered the Voice of him who spoke into a Funnel, which was placed
at the very Top of it. The Tyrant used to lodge all his State-Criminals,
or those whom he supposed to be engaged together in any Evil Designs
upon him, in this Dungeon. He had at the <a name="fr4393">same</a> time an Apartment over it,
where he used to apply himself to the Funnel, and by that Means
over-hear every thing that was whispered in <span style="color: #663300;">the</span><a href="#f4393"><sup>3</sup></a> Dungeon. I believe
one may venture to affirm, that a <i>C&aelig;sar</i> or an <i>Alexander</i> would rather
have died by the Treason, than have used such disingenuous Means for the
detecting of it. A Man, who in ordinary Life is very Inquisitive after
every thing which is spoken ill of him, passes his Time but very
indifferently. He is wounded by every Arrow that is shot at him, and
puts it in the Power of every insignificant Enemy to disquiet him. Nay,
he will suffer from what has been said of him, when it is forgotten by
those who said or heard it. For this Reason I could never bear one of
those officious Friends, <a name="fr4394">that</a> would be telling every malicious Report,
every idle Censure that <span style="color: #663300;">passed</span><a href="#f4394"><sup>4</sup></a> upon me. The Tongue of Man is so
petulant, and his Thoughts so variable, that one should not lay too
great a Stress upon any present Speeches and Opinions. Praise and
Obloquy proceed very frequently out of the same Mouth upon the same
Person, and upon the same Occasion. A generous Enemy will sometimes
bestow Commendations, as the dearest Friend cannot sometimes refrain
from speaking Ill. The Man who is indifferent in either of these
Respects, gives his Opinion at random, and praises or disapproves as he
finds himself in Humour.<br>
<br>
I shall conclude this Essay with Part of a Character, which
is finely <a name="fr4395">drawn</a> by the Earl of <i>Clarendon</i>, in the first Book of
his History, and which gives us the lively Picture of a great
Man teizing himself with an absurd Curiosity.

 <blockquote> 'He had not that Application and Submission, and Reverence for the
  Queen, as might have been expected from his Wisdom and Breeding; and
  often crossed her Pretences and De<b>Sir</b> es with more Rudeness than was
  natural to him. Yet he was impertinently sollicitous to know what her
  Majesty said of him in private, and what Resentments she had towards
  him. And when by some Confidents, who had their Ends upon him from
  those Offices, he was informed of some bitter Expressions fallen from
  her Majesty, he was so exceedingly afflicted and tormented with the
  Sense of it, that sometimes by passionate Complaints and
  Representations to the King; sometimes by more dutiful Addresses and
  Expostulations with the Queen, in bewailing his Misfortune; he
  frequently exposed himself, and left his Condition worse than it was
  before, and the Eclaircisment commonly ended in the Discovery of the
  Persons from whom he had received his most secret Intelligence.'<a href="#f4395"><sup>5</sup></a></blockquote>

I have already given my Reader an Account of a Sett of merry Fellows,
who are passing their Summer together in the Country, being provided of
a great House, where there is not only a convenient Apartment for every
particular Person, but a large Infirmary for the Reception of such of
them as are any way indisposed, or out of Humour. Having lately received
a Letter from the Secretary of this Society, by Order of the whole
Fraternity, which acquaints me with their Behaviour during the last
Week, I shall here make a Present of it to the Publick.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote> <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'We are glad to find that you approve the Establishment which we have
  here made for the retrieving of good Manners and agreeable
  Conversation, and shall use our best Endeavours so to improve our
  selves in this our Summer Retirement, that we may next Winter serve as
  Patterns to the Town.  But to the end that this our Institution may be
  no less Advantageous to the Publick than to our selves, we shall
  communicate to you one Week of our Proceedings, de<b>Sir</b> ing you at the
  same time, if you see any thing faulty in them, to favour us with your
  Admonitions. For you must know, <b>Sir</b> , that it has been proposed among
  us to chuse you for our Visitor, to which I must further add, that one
  of the College having declared last Week, he did not like the
  <i>Spectator</i> of the Day, and not being able to assign any just Reasons
  for such his Dislike, he was sent to the Infirmary <i>Nemine
  Contradicente</i>.<br>
<br>
  'On <i>Monday</i> the Assembly was in very good Humour, having received
  some Recruits of <i>French</i> Claret that Morning: when unluckily, towards
  the middle of the Dinner, one of the Company swore at his Servant in a
  very rough manner, for having put too much Water in his Wine. Upon
  which the President of the Day, who is always the Mouth of the
  Company, after having convinced him of the Impertinence of his
  Passion, and the Insult it had made upon the Company, ordered his Man
  to take him from the Table and convey him to the Infirmary. There was
  but one more sent away that Day; this was a Gentleman who is reckoned
  by some Persons one of the greatest Wits, and by others one of the
  greatest Boobies about Town. This you will say is a strange Character,
  but what makes it stranger yet, it is a very true one, for he is
  perpetually the Reverse of himself, being always merry or dull to
  Excess. We brought him hither to divert us, which he did very well
  upon the Road, having lavished away as much Wit and Laughter upon the
  Hackney Coachman as might have served him during his whole Stay here,
  had it been duly managed. He had been lumpish for two or three Days,
  but was so far connived at, in hopes of Recovery, that we dispatched
  one of the briskest Fellows among the Brotherhood into the Infirmary,
  for having told him at Table he was not merry. But our President
  observing that he indulged himself in this long Fit of Stupidity, and
  construing it as a Contempt of the College, ordered him to retire into
  the Place prepared for such Companions. He was no sooner got into it,
  but his Wit and Mirth returned upon him in so violent a manner, that
  he shook the whole Infirmary with the Noise of it, and had so good an
  Effect upon the rest of the Patients, that he brought them all out to
  Dinner with him the next Day.<br>
<br>
  'On <i>Tuesday</i> we were no sooner sat down, but one of the Company
  complained that his Head aked; upon which another asked him, in an
  insolent manner, what he did there then; this insensibly grew into
  some warm Words; so that the President, in order to keep the Peace,
  gave directions to take them both from the Table, and lodge them in
  the Infirmary. Not long after, another of the Company telling us, he
  knew by a Pain in his Shoulder that we should have some Rain, the
  President ordered him to be removed, and placed as a Weather-glass in
  the Apartment above mentioned.<br>
<br>
  'On <i>Wednesday</i> a Gentleman having received a Letter written in a
  Woman's Hand, and changing Colour twice or thrice as he read it,
  de<b>Sir</b> ed leave to retire into the Infirmary. The President consented,
  but denied him the Use of Pen, Ink and Paper, till such time as he had
  slept upon it. One of the Company being seated at the lower end of the
  Table, and discovering his secret Discontent by finding fault with
  every Dish that was served up, and refusing to Laugh at any thing that
  was said, the President told him, that he found he was in an uneasie
  Seat, and de<b>Sir</b> ed him to accommodate himself better in the Infirmary.
  After Dinner a very honest Fellow chancing to let a Punn fall from
  him, his Neighbour cryed out, <i>to the Infirmary</i>; at the same time
  pretending to be Sick at it, as having the same Natural Antipathy to a
  Punn, which some have to a Cat. This produced a long Debate. Upon the
  whole, the Punnster was Acquitted and his Neighbour sent off.<br>
<br>
'On <i>Thursday</i> there was but one Delinquent. This was a Gentleman of
  strong Voice, but weak Understanding. He had unluckily engaged himself
  in a Dispute with a Man of excellent Sense, but of a modest Elocution.
  The Man of Heat replied to every Answer of his Antagonist with a
  louder Note than ordinary, and only raised his Voice when he should
  have enforced his Argument. Finding himself at length driven to an
  Absurdity, he still reasoned in a more clamorous and confused manner,
  and to make the greater Impression upon his Hearers, concluded with a
  loud Thump upon the Table. The President immediately ordered him to be
  carried off, and dieted with Water-gruel, till such time as he should
  be sufficiently weakened for Conversation.<br>
<br>
  'On <i>Friday</i> there passed very little remarkable, saving only, that
  several Petitions were read of the Persons in Custody, de<b>Sir</b> ing to be
  released from their Confinement, and vouching for one another's good
  Behaviour for the future.<br>
<br>
  'On <i>Saturday</i> we received many Excuses from Persons who had found
  themselves in an unsociable Temper, and had voluntarily shut
  themselves up. The Infirmary was indeed never so full as on this Day,
  which I was at some loss to account for, till upon my going Abroad I
  observed that it was an Easterly Wind. The Retirement of most of my
  Friends has given me Opportunity and Leisure of writing you this
  Letter, which I must not conclude without assuring you, that all the
  Members of our College, as well those who are under Confinement, as
  those who are at Liberty, are your very humble Servants, tho' none
  more than,  <i>&amp;c.</i>'</blockquote>

<br>

Man, considered in himself, is a very helpless and a very wretched
Being. He is subject every Moment to the greatest Calamities and
Misfortunes. He is beset with Dangers on all sides, and may become
unhappy by numberless Casualties, which he could not foresee, nor have
prevented, had he foreseen them.<br>
<br>
It is our Comfort, while we are obnoxious to so many Accidents, that we
are under the Care of one who directs Contingencies, and has in his
Hands the Management of every Thing that is capable of annoying or
offending us; who knows the Assistance we stand in need of, and is
always ready to bestow it on those who ask it of him.<br>
<br>
The natural Homage, which such a Creature bears to so infinitely Wise
and Good a Being, is a firm Reliance on him for the Blessings and
Conveniences of Life, and an habitual Trust in him for Deliverance out
of all such Dangers and Difficulties as may befall us.<br>
<br>
The Man, who always lives in this Disposition of Mind, has not the same
dark and melancholy Views of Human Nature, as he who considers himself
abstractedly from this Relation to the Supreme Being. At the same time
that he reflects upon his own Weakness and Imperfection, he comforts
himself with the Contemplation of those Divine Attributes, which are
employed for his Safety and his Welfare. He finds his Want of Foresight
made up by the Omniscience of him who is his Support. He is not sensible
of his own want of Strength, when he knows that his Helper is Almighty.
In short, the Person who has a firm trust on the Supreme Being is
Powerful in <i>his</i> Power, Wise by <i>his</i> Wisdom, Happy by <i>his</i> Happiness.
He reaps the Benefit of every Divine Attribute, and loses his own
Insufficiency in the Fullness of Infinite Perfection.<br>
<br>
To make our Lives more easie to us, we are commanded to put our Trust in
him, who is thus able to relieve and succour us; the Divine Goodness
having made such a Reliance a Duty, notwithstanding we should have been
miserable had it been forbidden us.<br>
<br>
Among several Motives, which might be made use of to recommend this Duty
to us, I shall only take notice of those that follow.<br>
<br>
The first and strongest is, that we are promised, <i>He will not fail those
who put their Trust in him.</i><br>
<br>
But without considering the Supernatural Blessing which accompanies this
Duty, we may observe that it has a natural Tendency to its own Reward,
or in other Words, that this firm Trust and Confidence in the great
Disposer of all Things, contributes very much to the getting clear of
any Affliction, or to the bearing it manfully. A Person who believes he
has his Succour at hand, and that he acts in the sight of his Friend,
often excites himself beyond his Abilities, and does Wonders that are
not to be matched by one who is not animated with such a Confidence of
Success. I could produce Instances from History, of Generals, who out of
a Belief that they were under the Protection of some invisible
Assistant, did not only encourage their Soldiers to do their utmost, but
have acted themselves beyond what they would have done, had they not
been inspired by such a Belief. I might in the same manner show how such
a Trust in the Assistance of an Almighty Being, naturally produces
Patience, Hope, Cheerfulness, and all other Dispositions of Mind that
alleviate those Calamities which we are not able to remove.<br>
<br>
The Practice of this Virtue administers great Comfort to the Mind of Man
in Times of Poverty and Affliction, but most of all in the Hour of
Death. <a name="fr4411">When</a> the Soul is hovering in the last Moments of its <span style="color: #663300;">Separation</span><a href="#f4411"><sup>1</sup></a>, when it is just entring on another State of Existence, to converse
with Scenes, and Objects, and Companions that are altogether new, what
can support her under such Tremblings of Thought, such Fear, such
Anxiety, such Apprehensions, but <a name="fr4412">the</a> casting of all her Cares upon him
who first gave her Being, who has conducted her through one Stage of it,
and will be always with her to Guide and Comfort her in her <span style="color: #663300;">Progress</span><a href="#f4412"><sup>2</sup></a> through Eternity?<br>
<br>
<i>David</i> has very beautifully represented this steady Reliance on God
Almighty in his <i>twenty third Psalm</i>, which is a kind of <i>Pastoral</i> Hymn,
and filled with those Allusions which are usual in that kind of Writing.
As <a name="fr4413">the</a> Poetry is very exquisite, I shall present my Reader with the

<br>

I do not know whether I enough explained my self to the World, when I
invited all Men to be assistant to me in this my Work of Speculation;
for I have not yet acquainted my Readers, that besides the Letters and
valuable Hints I have from Time to Time received from my Correspondents,
I have by me several curious and extraordinary Papers sent with a Design
(as no one will doubt when they are published) that they might be
printed entire, and without any Alteration, by way of <i>Spectator</i>. I
must acknowledge also, that I my self being the first Projector of the
Paper, thought I had a Right to make them my own, by dressing them in my
own Style, by leaving out what would not appear like mine, and by adding
whatever might be proper to adapt them to the Character and Genius of my
Paper, with which it was almost impossible these could exactly
correspond, it being certain that hardly two Men think alike, and
therefore so many Men so many <i><b>Spectators</b></i>. Besides, I must own my
Weakness for Glory is such, that if I consulted that only, I might be so
far sway'd by it, as almost to wish that no one could write a
<i>Spectator</i> besides myself; nor can I deny, but upon the first Perusal
of those Papers, I felt some secret Inclinations of Ill-will towards the
Persons who wrote them. This was the Impression I had upon the first
reading them; but upon a late Review (more for the Sake of Entertainment
than Use) regarding them with another Eye than I had done at first, (for
by converting them as well as I could to my own Use, I thought I had
utterly disabled them from ever offending me again as <i><b>Spectators</b></i>) I
found my self moved by a Passion very different from that of Envy;
sensibly touched with Pity, the softest and most generous of all
Passions, when I reflected what a cruel Disapointment the Neglect of
those Papers must needs have been to the Writers who impatiently longed
to see them appear in Print, and who, no doubt, triumphed to themselves
in the Hopes of having a Share with me in the Applause of the Publick; a
Pleasure so great, that none but those who have experienced it can have
a Sense of it. In this Manner of viewing these Papers, I really found I
had not done them Justice, there being something so extremely natural
and peculiarly good in some of them, that I will appeal to the World
whether it was possible to alter a Word in them without doing them a
manifest Hurt and Violence; and whether they can ever appear rightly,
and, as they ought, but in their own native Dress and Colours: And
therefore I think I should not only wrong them, but deprive the World of
a considerable Satisfaction, should I any longer delay the making them
publick.<br>
<br>
After I have published a few of these <i><b>Spectators</b></i>, I doubt not but I
shall find the Success of them to equal, if not surpass, that of the
best of my own. An Author should take all Methods to humble himself in
the Opinion he has of his own Performances. When these Papers appear to
the World, I doubt not but they will be followed by many others; and I
shall not repine, though I my self shall have left me but very few Days
to appear in Publick: But preferring the general Weal and Advantage to
any Consideration of my self, I am resolved for the Future to publish
any <i>Spectator</i> that deserves it, entire, and without any Alteration;
assuring the World (if there can be Need of it) that it is none of mine
and if the Authors think fit to subscribe their Names, I will add them.<br>
<br>
I think the best way of promoting this generous and useful Design, will
be by giving out Subjects or Themes of all Kinds whatsoever, on which
(with a Preamble of the extraordinary Benefit and Advantage that may
accrue thereby to the Publick) I will invite all manner of Persons,
whether Scholars, Citizens, Courtiers, Gentlemen of the Town or Country,
and all Beaux, Rakes, Smarts, Prudes, Coquets, Housewives, and all Sorts
of Wits, whether Male or Female, and however distinguished, whether they
be True-Wits, Whole, or Half-Wits, or whether Arch, Dry, Natural,
Acquired, Genuine, or Deprav'd Wits; and Persons of all sorts of Tempers
and Complexions, whether the Severe, the Delightful, the Impertinent,
the Agreeable, the Thoughtful, Busie, or Careless; the Serene or Cloudy,
Jovial or Melancholy, Untowardly or Easie; the Cold, Temperate, or
Sanguine; and of what Manners or Dispositions soever, whether the
Ambitious or Humble-minded, the Proud or Pitiful, Ingenious or
Base-minded, Good or Ill-natur'd, Publick-spirited or Selfish; and under
what Fortune or Circumstance soever, whether the Contented or Miserable,
Happy or Unfortunate, High or Low, Rich or Poor (whether so through Want
of Money, or De<b>Sir</b> e of more) Healthy or Sickly, Married or Single; nay,
whether Tall or Short, Fat or Lean; and of what Trade, Occupation,
Profession, Station, Country, Faction, Party, Persuasion, Quality, Age
or Condition soever, who have ever made Thinking a Part of their
Business or Diversion, and have any thing worthy to impart on these
Subjects to the World, according to their several and respective Talents
or Genius's, and as the Subject given out hits their Tempers, Humours,
or Circumstances, or may be made profitable to the Publick by their
particular Knowledge or Experience in the Matter proposed, to do their
utmost on them by such a Time; to the End they may receive the
inexpressible and irresistible Pleasure of seeing their Essay allowed of
and relished by the rest of Mankind.<br>
<br>
I will not prepossess the Reader with too great Expectation of the
extraordinary Advantages which must redound to the Publick by these
Essays, when the different Thoughts and Observations of all Sorts of
Persons, according to their Quality, Age, Sex, Education, Professions,
Humours, Manners and Conditions, &amp;c. shall be set out by themselves in
the clearest and most genuine Light, and as they themselves would wish
to have them appear to the World.<br>
<br>
<i>The</i> Thesis <i>propos'd for the present Exercise of the Adventurers to
write</i> <b>Spectators</b>, <i>is</i> <b>Money</b>, <i>on which Subject all Persons are de<b>Sir</b> ed
to send their Thoughts within Ten Days after the Date hereof.</i><br>

Camillia <i>to the</i> <b>Spectator</b>.<br>
<br>
  <i>Venice, July 10</i>, N. S.<br>
<br>
<br>  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'I Take it extreamly ill, that you do not reckon conspicuous Persons
  of your Nation are within your Cognizance, tho' out of the Dominions
  of Great Britain. I little thought in the green Years of my Life, that
  I should ever call it an Happiness to be out of dear <i>England</i>; but as
  I grew to Woman, I found my self less acceptable in Proportion to the
  Encrease of my Merit. Their Ears in <i>Italy</i> are so differently formed
  from the Make of yours in <i>England</i>, that I never come upon the Stage,
  but a general Satisfaction appears in every Countenance of the whole
  People. When I dwell upon a Note, I behold all the Men accompanying me
  with Heads enclining and falling of their Persons on one Side, as
  dying away with me. The Women too do Justice to my Merit, and no
  ill-natur'd worthless Creature cries, <i>The vain Thing</i>, when I am rapt
  up in the Performance of my Part, and sensibly touched with the Effect
  my Voice has upon all who hear me. I live here distinguished as one
  whom Nature has been liberal to in a graceful Person, an exalted Mein,
  and Heavenly Voice. These Particularities in this strange Country, are
  Arguments for Respect and Generosity to her who is possessed of them.
  The <i>Italians</i> see a thousand Beauties I am sensible I have no
  Pretence to, and abundantly make up to me the Injustice I received in
  my own Country, of disallowing me what I really had. The Humour of

  is calling all his Faculties together to hear <i>Arabella</i>;

<blockquote><i>Let all be hush'd, each softest Motion cease,<br>
Be ev'ry loud tumultuous Thought at Peace;<br>
And ev'ry ruder Gasp of Breath<br>
Be calm, as in the Arms of Death:<br>
And thou, most fickle, most uneasie Part,<br>
Thou restless Wanderer, my Heart,<br>
Be still; gently, ah! gently leave,<br>
Thou busie, idle Thing, to heave.<br>
Stir not a Pulse: and let my Blood,<br>
That turbulent, unruly Flood,<br>
     Be softly staid;<br>
Let me be all but my Attention dead.</i></blockquote>

  'The whole City of <i>Venice</i> is as still when I am singing, as this

  'The Project in yours of the 11th Instant, of furthering the
  Correspondence and Knowledge of that considerable Part of Mankind, the
  Trading World, cannot but be highly commendable. Good Lectures to
  young Traders may have very good Effects on their Conduct: but beware
  you propagate no false Notions of Trade; let none of your
  Correspondents impose on the World, by putting forth base Methods in a
  good Light, and glazing them over with improper Terms. I would have no
  Means of Profit set for Copies to others, but such as are laudable in
  themselves. Let not Noise be called Industry, nor Impudence Courage.
  Let not good Fortune be imposed on the World for good Management, nor
  Poverty be called Folly; impute not always Bankruptcy to Extravagance,
  nor an Estate to Foresight; Niggardliness is not good Husbandry, nor
  Generosity Profusion.<br>
<br>
  '<i>Honestus</i> is a well-meaning and judicious Trader, hath substantial
  Goods, and trades with his own Stock; husbands his Money to the best
  Advantage, without taking all Advantages of the Necessities of his
  Workmen, or grinding the Face of the Poor. <i>Fortunatus</i> is stocked
  with Ignorance, and consequently with Self-Opinion; the Quality of his
  Goods cannot but be suitable to that of his Judgment. <i>Honestus</i>
  pleases discerning People, and keeps their Custom by good Usage; makes
  modest Profit by modest Means, to the decent Support of his Family:
  Whilst <i>Fortunatus</i> blustering always, pushes on, promising much, and
  performing little, with Obsequiousness offensive to People of Sense;
  strikes at all, catches much the greater Part; raises a considerable
  Fortune by Imposition on others, to the Disencouragement and Ruin of
  those who trade in the same Way.<br>
<br>
  'I give here but loose Hints, and beg you to be very circumspect in
  the Province you have now undertaken: If you perform it successfully,
  it will be a very great Good; for nothing is more wanting, than that
  Mechanick Industry were set forth with the Freedom and Greatness of
  Mind which ought always to accompany a Man of a liberal Education.<br>

 'Notwithstanding the repeated Censures that your Spectatorial Wisdom

 disoblige. I should be very glad too if you would take Notice, that a
 daily Repetition of the same over-bearing Insolence is yet more

It gives me much Despair in the Design of reforming the World by my
Speculations, when I find there always arise, from one Generation to
another, successive Cheats and Bubbles, as naturally as Beasts of Prey,
and those which are to be their Food. There is hardly a Man in the
World, one would think, so ignorant, as not to know that the ordinary
Quack Doctors, who publish their great Abilities in little brown
Billets, distributed to all who pass by, are to a Man Impostors and
Murderers; yet such is the Credulity of the Vulgar, and the Impudence of
these Professors, that the Affair still goes on, and new Promises of
what was never done before are made every Day. What aggravates the Just
is, that even this Promise has been made as long as the Memory of Man
can trace it, and yet nothing performed, and yet still prevails. As I
was passing along to-day, a Paper given into my Hand by a Fellow without
a Nose tells us as follows what good News is come to Town, to wit, that
there is now a certain Cure for the <i>French</i> Disease, by a Gentleman
just <a name="fr4442">come</a> from his Travels.

  <blockquote><i>In</i> Russel-Court, <i>over-against the</i> Cannon-Ball, <i>at the</i> Surgeon's
  Arms <i>in</i> Drury-Lane, <i>is lately come from his Travels a Surgeon who
  has practised Surgery and Physick both by Sea and Land these twenty
  four Years. He (by the Blessing) cures the</i> Yellow Jaundice, Green
  Sickness, Scurvy, Dropsy, Surfeits, long Sea Voyages, Campains, and
  Womens Miscarriages, Lying-Inn, <i>&amp;c. as some People that has been lame
  these thirty Years can testifie; in short, he cureth all Diseases
  incident to Men, Women, or Children</i><a href="#f4442"><sup>2</sup></a>.</blockquote>

If a Man could be so indolent as to look upon this Havock of the human
Species which is made by Vice and Ignorance, it would be a good
ridiculous Work to comment upon the Declaration of this accomplished
Traveller. There is something unaccountably taking among the Vulgar in
those who come from a great Way off. Ignorant People of Quality, as many
there are of such, doat excessively this Way; many Instances of which
every Man will suggest to himself without my Enumeration of them. The
Ignorants of lower Order, who cannot, like the upper Ones, be profuse of
their Money to those recommended by coming from a Distance, are no less
complaisant than the others, for they venture their Lives from the same
Admiration.<br>
<br>
<i>The Doctor is lately come from his Travels</i>, and has <i>practised</i> both
by Sea and Land, and therefore Cures the <i>Green Sickness, long Sea
Voyages, Campains, and Lying-Inn</i>. Both by Sea and Land!&mdash;I will not
answer for the Distempers called <i>Sea Voyages and Campains</i>; But I dare
say, those of Green Sickness and Lying-Inn might be as well taken Care
of if the Doctor staid a-shoar. But the Art of managing Mankind, is only
to make them stare a little, to keep up their Astonishment, to let
nothing be familiar to them, but ever to have something in your Sleeve,
in which they must think you are deeper than they are. There is an
ingenious Fellow, a Barber, of my Acquaintance, who, besides his broken
Fiddle and a dryed Sea-Monster, has a Twine-Cord, strained with two
Nails at each End, over his Window, and the Words <i>Rainy, Dry, Wet</i>, and
so forth, written, to denote the Weather according to the Rising or
Falling of the Cord. We very great Scholars are not apt to wonder at
this: But I observed a very honest Fellow, a chance Customer, who sate
in the Chair before me to be shaved, fix his Eye upon this Miraculous
Performance during the Operation upon his Chin and Face. When those and
his Head also were cleared of all Incumbrances and Excrescences, he
looked at the Fish, then at the Fiddle, still grubling in his Pockets,
and casting his Eye again at the Twine, and the Words writ on each Side;
then altered his mind as to Farthings, and gave my Friend a Silver
Six-pence. The Business, as I said, is to keep up the Amazement; and if
my Friend had had only the Skeleton and Kitt, he must have been
contented with a less Payment. But the Doctor we were talking of, adds
to his long Voyages the Testimony of some People <i>that has been thirty
Years lame.</i> When I received my Paper, a sagacious Fellow took one at
the same time, and read till he came to the Thirty Years Confinement of
his Friends, and went off very well convinced of the Doctor's
Sufficiency. You have many of these prodigious Persons, who have had
some extraordinary Accident at their Birth, or a great Disaster in some
Part of their Lives. Any thing, however foreign from the Business the
People want of you, will convince them of your Ability in that you
profess. There is a Doctor in <i>Mouse-Alley</i> near <i>Wapping,</i> who sets up
for curing Cataracts upon the Credit of having, as his Bill sets forth,
lost an Eye in the Emperor's Service. His Patients come in upon this,
and he shews the Muster-Roll, which confirms that he was in his Imperial
Majesty's Troops; and he puts out their Eyes with great Success. Who
<a name="fr4443">would</a> believe that a Man should be a Doctor for the Cure of bursten
Children, by declaring that his Father and Grandfather were <span style="color: #663300;">born</span><a href="#f4443"><sup>3</sup></a>
bursten? But <i>Charles Ingoltson,</i> next Door to the <i>Harp</i> in <i>Barbican,</i>
has made a pretty Penny by that Asseveration. The Generality go upon
their first Conception, and think no further; all the rest is granted.
They take it, that there is something uncommon in you, and give you
Credit for the rest. You may be sure it is upon that I go, when
sometimes, let it be to the Purpose or not, I keep a <i>Latin</i> Sentence in
my Front; and I was not a little pleased when I observed one of my
Readers say, casting his Eye on my twentieth Paper, <i>More</i> Latin <i>still?
What a prodigious Scholar is this Man!</i> But as I have here taken much
Liberty with this learned Doctor, I must make up all I have said by
repeating what he seems to be in Earnest in, and honestly promise to
those who will not receive him as a great Man; to wit, That from <i>Eight
to Twelve, and from Two till Six, he attends for the good of the Publick
to bleed for Three Pence.</i><br>

This is the Day on which many eminent Authors will probably Publish
their Last Words. I am afraid that few of our Weekly Historians, who are
Men that above all others delight in War, will be able to subsist under
the Weight of a Stamp, and an approaching Peace. A Sheet of Blank Paper
that must have this new Imprimatur clapt upon it, before it is qualified
to Communicate any thing to the Publick, will make its way in the World
<a name="fr4451">but</a> very heavily. In short, the Necessity of carrying a Stamp<a href="#f4451"><sup>1</sup></a>, and
the Improbability of notifying a Bloody Battel, will, I am afraid, both
concur to the sinking of those thin Folios, which have every other Day
retailed to us the History of <i>Europe</i> for several Years last past. A
Facetious Friend of mine, who loves a Punn, calls this present Mortality
among Authors, <i>The Fall of the Leaf.</i><br>
<br>
I remember, upon Mr. <i>Baxter's</i> Death, there was Published a Sheet of
very good Sayings, inscribed, <i>The last Words of Mr.</i> Baxter. The Title
sold so great a Number of these Papers, that about a Week after there
came out a second Sheet, inscrib'd, <i>More last Words of Mr.</i> Baxter. In
the same manner, I have Reason to think, that several Ingenious Writers,
who have taken their Leave of the Publick, in farewell Papers, will not
give over so, but intend to appear again, tho' perhaps under another
Form, and with a different Title. Be that as it will, it is my Business,
in this place, to give an Account of my own Intentions, and to acquaint
my Reader with the Motives by which I Act, in this great Crisis of the
Republick of Letters.<br>
<br>
I have been long debating in my own Heart, whether I should throw up my
Pen, as an Author that is cashiered by the Act of Parliament, which is
to Operate within these Four and Twenty Hours, or whether I should still
persist in laying my Speculations, from Day to Day, before the Publick.
The Argument which prevails with me most on the first side of the
Question is, that I am informed by my Bookseller he must raise the Price
of every single Paper to Two-Pence, or that he shall not be able to pay
the Duty of it. Now as I am very de<b>Sir</b> ous my Readers should have their
Learning as cheap as possible, it is with great Difficulty that I comply
with him in this Particular.<br>
<br>
However, upon laying my Reasons together in the Balance, I find that
those which plead for the Continuance of this Work, have much the
greater Weight. For, in the first Place, in Recompence for the Expence
to which this will put my Readers, it is to be hoped they may receive
from every Paper so much Instruction, as will be a very good Equivalent.
And, in order to this, I would not advise any one to take it in, who
after the Perusal of it, does not find himself Two-pence the wiser, or
the better Man for it; or who upon Examination, does not believe that he
has had Two-pennyworth of Mirth or Instruction for his Money.<br>
<br>
But I must confess there is another Motive which prevails with me more
than the former. I consider that the Tax on Paper was given for the
Support of the Government; and as I have Enemies, who are apt to pervert
every thing I do or say, I fear they would ascribe the laying down my
Paper, on such an Occasion, to a Spirit of Malecontentedness, which I am
resolved none shall ever justly upbraid me with. No, I shall glory in
contributing my utmost to the Weal Publick; and if my Country receives
Five or Six Pounds a-day by my Labours, I shall be very well pleased to
find my self so useful a Member. It is a received Maxim, that no honest
Man should enrich himself by Methods that are prejudicial to the
Community in which he lives; and by the same Rule I think we may
pronounce the Person to deserve very well of his Countrymen, whose
Labours bring more into the publick Coffers, than into his own Pocket.<br>
<br>
Since I have mentioned the Word Enemies, I must explain my self so far
as to acquaint my Reader, that I mean only the insignificant Party
Zealots on both sides; Men of such poor narrow Souls, that they are not
capable of thinking on any thing but with an Eye to Whig or Tory. During
the Course of this Paper, I have been accused by these despicable
Wretches of Trimming, Time-serving, Personal Reflection, secret Satire,
and the like. Now, tho' in these my Compositions, it is visible to any
Reader of Common Sense, that I consider nothing but my Subject, which is
always of an indifferent Nature; how is it possible for me to write so
clear of Party, as not to lie open to the Censures of those who will be
applying every Sentence, and finding out Persons and Things in it, which
it has no regard to?<br>
<br>
Several Paltry Scriblers and Declaimers have done me the Honour to be
dull upon me in Reflections of this Nature; but notwithstanding my Name
has been sometimes traduced by this contemptible Tribe of Men, I have
hitherto avoided all Animadversions upon 'em. The Truth of it is, I am
afraid of making them appear considerable by taking Notice of them, for
they are like those imperceptible Insects which are discover'd by the
Microscope, and cannot be made the Subject of Observation without being
magnified.<br>
<br>
Having mentioned those few who have shewn themselves the Enemies of this
Paper, I should be very ungrateful to the Publick, did not I at the same
time testifie my Gratitude to those who are its Friends, in which Number
I may reckon many of the most distinguished Persons of all Conditions,
Parties and Professions in the Isle of <i>Great-Britain</i>. I am not so vain
as to think this Approbation is so much due to the Performance as to the
Design. There is, and ever will be, Justice enough in the World, to
afford Patronage and Protection for those who endeavour to advance Truth
and Virtue, without regard to the Passions and Prejudices of any
particular Cause or Faction. If I have any other Merit in me, it is that
I have new-pointed all the Batteries of Ridicule. They have been
generally planted against Persons who have appeared Serious rather than
Absurd; or at best, have aimed rather at what is Unfashionable than what
is Vicious. For my own part, I have endeavoured to make nothing
Ridiculous that is not in some measure Criminal. I have set up the
Immoral Man as the Object of Derision: In short, if I have not formed a
new Weapon against Vice and Irreligion, I have at least shewn how that
Weapon may be put to a right Use, which has so often fought the Battels
of Impiety and Profaneness.<br>

<a name="f4451"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote 1:</span></a> &nbsp;The Stamp Act was to take effect from the first of August.
Censorship of the press began in the Church soon after the invention of
printing. The ecclesiastical superintendence introduced in 1479 and 1496
was more completely established by a bull of Leo X. in 1515, which
required Bishops and Inquisitors to examine all books before printing,
and suppress heretical opinions. The Church of Rome still adheres to the
<i>Index Librorum Prohibitorum</i> begun by the Council of Trent in 1546; and
there is an Index Expurgatorius for works partly prohibited, or to be
read after expurgation. In accordance with this principle, the licensing
of English books had been in the power of the Archbishop of Canterbury
and his delegates before the decree of the Star Chamber in 1637, which
ordered that all books of Divinity, Physic, Philosophy, and Poetry
should be licensed either by the Archbishop of Canterbury or by the
Bishop of London personally or through their appointed substitutes. The
object of this decree was to limit the reprint of old books of divinity,
&amp;c. Thus Foxe's <i>Book of Martyrs </i>was denied a license. In 1640 <b>Sir</b>  Edward
Dering complained to Parliament that 

 <blockquote> 'the most learned labours of our
ancient and best divines must now be corrected and defaced with a
<i>deleatur</i> by the supercilious pen of my Lord's young chaplain, fit,
perhaps, for the technical arts, but unfit to hold the chair of
Divinity.' </blockquote>

(Rushworth's Hist. Coll. iv. 55.) Historical works seem to
have been submitted to the Secretary of State for his sanction. To May's
poem of the <i>Victorious Reign of King Edward the Third</i> is prefixed,

<blockquote> 'I
have perused this Book, and conceive it very worthy to be published. Io.
Coke, Knight, Principal Secretary of State, Whitehall, 17 of November,
1634.'</blockquote> 

But Aleyn's metrical <i>History of Henry VII.</i> (1638) is licensed
by the Bishop of London's domestic chaplain, who writes: 

<blockquote>'Perlegi
historicum hoc poema, dignumque judico quod Typis mandetur. Tho. Wykes
R. P. Episc. Lond. Chapell. Domest.'</blockquote> 

The first newspaper had been <i>the
Weekly Newes</i>, first published May 23, 1622, at a time when, says <b>Sir</b> 
Erskine May (in his <i>Constitutional History of England</i>, 1760-1860),

<blockquote>'political discussion was silenced by the licenser, the Star Chamber,
the dungeon, the pillory, mutilation, and branding.' </blockquote>

The contest between
King and Commons afterwards developed the free controversial use of
tracts and newspapers, but the Parliament was not more tolerant than the
king, and against the narrow spirit of his time Milton rose to his
utmost height, fashioning after the masterpiece of an old Greek orator
who sought to stir the blood of the Athenians, his <i>Areopagitica</i>, or
<i>Defence of the Liberty of Unlicensed Printing</i>. In the reign of Charles
II. the Licensing Act (13 and 14 Charles II. cap. 33) placed the control
of printing in the Government, confined exercise of the printer's art to
London, York, and the Universities, and limited the number of the master
printers to twenty. Government established a monopoly of news in the
London Gazette. 

<blockquote>'Authors and printers of obnoxious works,' says <b>Sir</b>  E.
May, citing cases in notes, were hung, 'quartered, and mutilated,
exposed in the pillory and flogged, or fined and imprisoned, according
to the temper of their judges: their productions were burned by the
common hangman. Freedom of opinion was under interdict: even news could
not be published without license... James II. and his infamous judges
carried the Licensing Act into effect with barbarous severity. But the
Revolution brought indulgence even to the Jacobite Press; and when the
Commons, in 1695, refused to renew the Licensing Act, a censorship of
the press was for ever renounced by the law of England.'</blockquote> 

There remained,
however, a rigorous interpretation of the libel laws; Westminster Hall
accepting the traditions of the Star Chamber. Still there was enough
removal of restriction to ensure the multiplication of newspapers and
the blending of intelligence with free political discussion. In Queen
Anne's reign the virulence of party spirit produced bitter personal
attacks and willingness on either side to bring an antagonist under the
libel laws. At the date of this <i>Spectator</i> paper Henry St. John, who
had been made Secretary of State at the age of 32, was 34 years old, and
the greatest commoner in England, as Swift said, turning the whole
Parliament, who can do nothing without him. This great position and the
future it might bring him he was throwing away for a title, and becoming
Viscount Bolingbroke. His last political act as a commoner was to impose
the halfpenny stamp upon newspapers and sheets like those of the
<i>Spectator.</i> Intolerant of criticism, he had in the preceding session
brought to the bar of the House of Commons, under his warrant as
Secretary of State, fourteen printers and publishers. In the beginning
of 1712, the Queen's message had complained that by seditious papers and
factious rumours designing men had been able to sink credit, and the
innocent had suffered. On the 12th of February a committee of the whole
house was appointed to consider how to stop the abuse of the liberty of
the press. Some were for a renewal of the Licensing Act, some for
requiring writers' names after their articles. The Government carried
its own design of a half-penny stamp by an Act (10 Anne, cap. 19) passed
on the 10th of June, which was to come in force on the 1st of August,
1712, and be in force for 32 years. 

 <blockquote> 'Do you know,' wrote Swift to Stella five days after the date of this
  <i>Spectator</i> paper, 'Do you know that all Grub street is dead and gone
  last week? No more ghosts or murders now for love or money... Every
  single half sheet pays a halfpenny to the Queen. The <i>Observator</i> is
  fallen; the <i>Medleys</i> are jumbled together with the <i>Flying Post;</i> the
  <i>Examiner</i> is deadly sick; the <i>Spectator</i> keeps up and doubles its
  price; I know not how long it will last.'</blockquote>

It so happened that the mortality was greatest among Government papers.
The Act presently fell into abeyance, was revived in 1725, and
thenceforth maintained the taxation of newspapers until the abolition of
the Stamp in 1859. One of its immediate effects was a fall in the
circulation of the <i>Spectator.</i> The paper remained unchanged, and some
of its subscribers seem to have resented the doubling of the tax upon
them, by charging readers an extra penny for each halfpenny with which
it had been taxed. (See <a href="#section488">No. 488</a>.)<br>

Since two or three Writers of Comedy who are now living have taken their
Farewell of the Stage, those who succeed them finding themselves
incapable of rising up to their Wit, Humour and good Sense, have only
imitated them in some of those loose unguarded Strokes, in which they
complied with the corrupt Taste of the more Vicious Part of their
Audience. When Persons of a low Genius attempt this kind of Writing,
they know no difference between being Merry and being Lewd. It is with
an Eye to some of these degenerate Compositions that I have written the
following Discourse.<br>
<br>
Were our <i>English</i> Stage but half so virtuous as that of the <i>Greeks</i> or
<i>Romans</i>, we should quickly see the Influence of it in the Behaviour of
all the Politer Part of Mankind. It would not be fashionable to ridicule
Religion, or its Professors; the Man of Pleasure would not be the
compleat Gentleman; Vanity would be out of Countenance, and every
Quality which is Ornamental to Human Nature, would meet with that Esteem
which is due to it.<br>
<br>
If the <i>English</i> Stage were under the same Regulations the <i>Athenian</i>
was formerly, it would have the same Effect that had, in recommending
the Religion, the Government, and Publick Worship of its Country. Were
our Plays subject to proper Inspections and Limitations, we might not
only pass away several of our vacant Hours in the highest
Entertainments; but should always rise from them wiser and better than
we sat down to them.<br>
<br>
It is one of the most unaccountable things in our Age, that the Lewdness
of our Theatre should be so much complained of, so well exposed, and so
little redressed. It is to be hoped, that some time or other we may be
at leisure to restrain the Licentiousness of the Theatre, and make it
contribute its Assistance to the Advancement of Morality, and to the
Reformation of the Age. As Matters stand at present, Multitudes are shut
out from this noble Diversion, by reason of those Abuses and Corruptions
that accompany it. A Father is often afraid that his Daughter should be
ruin'd by those Entertainments, which were invented for the
Accomplishment and Refining of Human Nature. The <i>Athenian</i> and <i>Roman</i>
Plays were written with such a Regard to Morality, that <i>Socrates</i> used
to frequent the one, and <i>Cicero</i> the other.<br>
<br>
It happened once indeed, that Cato dropped into the <i>Roman</i> Theatre,
when the <i>Floralia</i> were to be represented; and as in that Performance,
which was a kind of Religious Ceremony, there were several indecent
Parts to be acted, the People refused to see them whilst <i>Cato</i> was
present. <i>Martial</i> on this Hint made the following Epigram, which we
must suppose was applied to some grave Friend of his, that had been
accidentally present at some such Entertainment.

<blockquote><i>Nosces jocos&aelig; dulce cum sacrum Flor&aelig;,<br>
Festosque lusus, et licentiam vulgi,<br>
Cur in Theatrum Cato severe venisti?<br>
An ideo tantum veneras, ut exires?</i><br><br>

Why dost thou come, great Censor of the Age,<br>
To see the loose Diversions of the Stage?<br>
With awful Countenance and Brow severe,<br>
What in the Name of Goodness dost thou here?<br>
See the mixt Crowd! how Giddy, Lewd and Vain!<br>
Didst thou come in but to go out again?</blockquote>

An Accident of this Nature might happen once in an Age among the
<i>Greeks</i> or <i>Romans</i>; but they were too wise and good to let the
constant Nightly Entertainment be of such a Nature, that People of the
most Sense and Virtue could not be at it. Whatever Vices are represented
upon the Stage, they ought to be so marked and branded by the Poet, as
not to appear either laudable or amiable in the Person who is tainted
with them. But if we look into the <i>English</i> Comedies above mentioned,
we would think they were formed upon a quite contrary Maxim, and that
this Rule, tho' it held good upon the Heathen Stage, was not be regarded
in Christian Theatres. There is another Rule likewise, which was
observed by Authors of Antiquity, and which these modern Genius's have
no regard to, and that was never to chuse an improper Subject for
Ridicule. Now a Subject is improper for Ridicule, if it is apt to stir
up Horrour and Commiseration rather than Laughter. For this Reason, we
do not find any Comedy in so polite an Author as <i>Terence</i>, raised upon
the Violations of the Marriage-Bed. The Falshood of the Wife or Husband
has given Occasion to noble Tragedies, but a <i>Scipio</i> or a <i>Lelius</i>
would have look'd upon Incest or Murder to have been as proper Subjects
for Comedy. On the contrary, Cuckoldom is the Basis of most of our
Modern Plays. If an Alderman appears upon the Stage, you may be sure it
is in order to be Cuckolded. An Husband that is a little grave or
elderly, generally meets with the same Fate. Knights and Baronets,
Country Squires, and Justices of the <i>Quorum</i>, come up to Town for no
other Purpose. I have seen poor <i>Dogget</i> Cuckolded in all these
Capacities. In short, our <i>English</i> Writers are as frequently severe
upon this innocent unhappy Creature, commonly known by the Name of a
Cuckold, as the Ancient Comick Writers were upon an eating Parasite or a
vain-glorious Soldier.<br>
<br>
At the same time the Poet so contrives Matters, that the two Criminals
are the Favourites of the Audience. We sit still, and wish well to them
through the whole Play, are pleased when they meet with proper
Opportunities, and out of humour when they are disappointed. The Truth
of it is, the accomplished Gentleman upon the <i>English Stage</i>, is the
Person that is familiar with other Men's Wives, and indifferent to his
own; as the fine Woman is generally a Composition of Sprightliness and
Falshood. I do not know whether it proceeds from Barrenness of
Invention, Depravation of Manners, or Ignorance of Mankind, but I have
often wondered that our ordinary Poets cannot frame to themselves the
Idea of a Fine Man who is not a Whore-master, or of a Fine Woman that is
not a Jilt.<br>
<br>
I have sometimes thought of compiling a System of Ethics out of the
Writings of these corrupt Poets, under the Title of <i>Stage Morality</i>.
But I have been diverted from this Thought, by a Project which has been
executed by an ingenious Gentleman of my Acquaintance. He has compos'd,
it seems, the History of a young Fellow, who has taken all his Notions
of the World from the Stage, and who has directed himself in every
Circumstance of his Life and Conversation, by the Maxims and Examples of
the Fine Gentlemen in <i>English</i> Comedies. If I can prevail upon him to
give me a Copy of this new-fashioned Novel, I will bestow on it a Place
in my Works, and question not but it may have as good an Effect upon the
Drama, as <i>Don Quixote</i> had upon Romance.<br>

There is not a Common Saying which has a better turn of Sense in it,
than what we often hear in the Mouths of the Vulgar, that Custom is a
second Nature. It is indeed able to form the Man anew, and to give him
Inclinations and Capacities altogether different from those he was born
with. <a name="fr4471"></a>Dr. <i>Plot</i>, in his History of <i>Staffordshire</i><a href="#f4471"><sup>1</sup></a>, tells us of an
Ideot that chancing to live within the Sound of a Clock, and always
amusing himself with counting the Hour of the Day whenever the Clock
struck, the Clock being spoiled by some Accident, the Ideot continued to
strike and count the Hour without the help of it, in the same manner as
he had done when it was entire. Though I dare not vouch for the Truth of
this Story, it is very certain that Custom has a Mechanical Effect upon
the Body, at the same time that it has a very extraordinary Influence
upon the Mind.<br>
<br>
I shall in this Paper consider one very remarkable Effect which Custom
has upon Human Nature; and which, if rightly observed, may lead us into
very useful Rules of Life. What I shall here take notice of in Custom,
is its wonderful Efficacy in making every thing pleasant to us. A Person
who is addicted to Play or Gaming, though he took but little delight in
it at first, by degrees contracts so strong an Inclination towards it,
and gives himself up so entirely to it, that it seems the only End of
his Being. The Love of a retired or busie Life will grow upon a Man
insensibly, as he is conversant in the one or the other, till he is
utterly unqualified for relishing that to which he has been for some
time disused. Nay, a Man may Smoak, or Drink, or take Snuff, till he is
unable to pass away his Time without it; not to mention our Delight in
any particular Study, Art, or Science, rises and improves in Proportion
to the Application which we bestow upon it. Thus what was at first an
Exercise, becomes at length an Entertainment. Our Employments are
changed into our Diversions. The Mind grows fond of those Actions she is
accustomed to, and is drawn with Reluctancy from those Paths in which
she has been used to walk.<br>
<br>
Not only such Actions as were at first Indifferent to us, but even such
as were Painful, will by Custom and Practice become pleasant. <b>Sir</b> 
<i>Francis Bacon</i> observes in his Natural Philosophy, that our Taste is
never pleased better, than with those things which at first created a
Disgust in it. He gives particular Instances of Claret, Coffee, and
other Liquors, which the palate seldom approves upon the first Taste;
but when it has once got a Relish of them, generally retains it for
Life. The Mind is constituted after the same manner, and after having
habituated her self to any particular Exercise or Employment, not only
loses her first Aversion towards it, but conceives a certain Fondness
and Affection for it. I <a name="fr4472">have</a> heard one of the greatest Genius's this Age
has produced<a href="#f4472"><sup>2</sup></a>, who had been trained up in all the Polite Studies of
Antiquity assure me, upon his being obliged to search into several Rolls
and Records, that notwithstanding such an Employment was at first very
dry and irksome to him, he at last took an incredible Pleasure in it,
and preferred it even to the reading of <i>Virgil</i> or <i>Cicero</i>. The Reader
will observe, that I have not here considered Custom as it makes things
easie, but as it renders them delightful; and though others have often
made the same Reflections, it is possible they may not have drawn those
Uses from it, with which I intend to fill the remaining Part of this
Paper.<br>
<br>
If we consider attentively this Property of Human Nature, it may
instruct us in very fine Moralities. In the first place, I would have no
Man discouraged with that kind of Life or Series of Action, in which the
Choice of others, or his own Necessities, may have engaged him. It may
perhaps be very disagreeable to him at first; but Use and Application
will certainly render it not only less painful, but pleasing and
satisfactory.<br>
<br>
In <a name="fr4473">the</a> second place I would recommend to every one that admirable
Precept which <i>Pythagoras</i><a href="#f4473"><sup>3</sup></a> is said to have given to his Disciples,
and which that Philosopher must have drawn from the Observation I have
enlarged upon. <i>Optimum vit&aelig; genus eligito, nam consuetudo faciet
jucundissimum</i>, Pitch upon that Course of Life which is the most
Excellent, and Custom will render it the most Delightful. Men, whose
Circumstances will permit them to chuse their own Way of Life, are
inexcusable if they do not pursue that which their Judgment tells them
is the most laudable. The Voice of Reason is more to be regarded than
the Bent of any present Inclination, since by the Rule above mentioned,
Inclination will at length come over to Reason, though we can never
force Reason to comply with Inclination.<br>
<br>
In the third place, this Observation may teach the most sensual and
irreligious Man, to overlook those Hardships and Difficulties which are
apt to discourage him from the Prosecution of a Virtuous Life. <a name="fr4474"></a><i>The
Gods</i>, said <i>Hesiod</i><a href="#f4474"><sup>4</sup></a>, <i>have placed Labour before Virtue, the Way to
her is at first rough and difficult, but grows more smooth and easier
the further you advance in it</i>. The Man who proceeds in it, with
Steadiness and Resolution, will in a little time find that <i>her Ways are
Ways of Pleasantness, and that all her Paths are Peace</i>.<br>
<br>
To enforce this Consideration, we may further observe that the Practice
of Religion will not only be attended with that Pleasure, which
naturally accompanies those Actions to which we are habituated, but with
those Supernumerary Joys of Heart, that rise from the Consciousness of
such a Pleasure, from the Satisfaction of acting up to the Dictates of
Reason, and from the Prospect of an happy Immortality.<br>
<br>
In the fourth place, we may learn from this Observation which we have
made on the Mind of Man, to take particular Care, when we are once
settled in a regular Course of Life, how we too frequently indulge our
selves in any of the most innocent Diversions and Entertainments, since
the Mind may insensibly fall off from the Relish of virtuous Actions,
and, by degrees, exchange that Pleasure which it takes in the
Performance of its Duty, for Delights of a much more inferior and
unprofitable Nature.<br>
<br>
The last Use which I shall make of this remarkable Property in Human
Nature, of being delighted with those Actions to which it is accustomed,
is to shew how absolutely necessary it is for us to gain Habits of
Virtue in this Life, if we would enjoy the Pleasures of the next. The
State of Bliss we call Heaven will not be capable of affecting those
Minds, which are not thus qualified for it; we must, in this World, gain
a Relish of Truth and Virtue, if we would be able to taste that
Knowledge and Perfection, which are to make us happy in the next. The
Seeds of those spiritual Joys and Raptures, which are to rise up and
Flourish in the Soul to all Eternity, must be planted in her, during
this her present State of Probation. In short, Heaven is not to be
looked upon only as the Reward, but as the natural Effect of a religious
Life.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, those evil Spirits, who, by long Custom, have
contracted in the Body Habits of Lust and Sensuality, Malice and
Revenge, an Aversion to every thing that is good, just or laudable, are
naturally seasoned and prepared for Pain and Misery. Their Torments have
already taken root in them, they cannot be happy when divested of the
Body, unless we may suppose, that Providence will, in a manner, create
them anew, and work a Miracle in the Rectification of their Faculties.
They may, indeed, taste a kind of malignant Pleasure in those Actions to
which they are accustomed, whilst in this Life; but when they are
removed from all those Objects which are here apt to gratifie them, they
will <a name="fr4475">naturally</a> become their own Tormentors, and cherish in themselves
those painful Habits of Mind, which are called, <span style="color: #663300;">in</span><a href="#f4475"><sup>5</sup></a> Scripture
Phrase, the Worm which never dies. This Notion of Heaven and Hell is so
very conformable to the Light of Nature, that it was discovered by
several of the most exalted Heathens. It has been finely improved by
many Eminent Divines of the last Age, as in <a name="fr4476">particular</a> by Arch-Bishop
<i>Tillotson</i> and Dr. <i>Sherlock</i>, but there is none who has raised such
noble Speculations upon it as Dr. <i>Scott</i><a href="#f4476"><sup>6</sup></a> in the First Book of his
Christian Life, which is one of the finest and most rational Schemes of
Divinity, that is written in our Tongue, or in any other. That Excellent
Author has shewn how every particular Custom and Habit of Virtue will,
in its own Nature, produce the Heaven, or a State of Happiness, in him
who shall hereafter practise it: As on the contrary, how every Custom or
Habit of Vice will be the natural Hell of him in whom it subsists.<br>

The first Steps towards Ill are very carefully to be avoided, for Men
insensibly go on when they are once entered, and do not keep up a lively
Abhorrence of the least Unworthiness. There is a certain frivolous
Falshood that People indulge themselves in, which ought to be had in
greater Detestation than it commonly meets with: What I mean is a
Neglect of Promises made on small and indifferent Occasions, such as
Parties of Pleasure, Entertainments, and sometimes Meetings out of
Curiosity in Men of like Faculties to be in each other's Company. There
are many Causes to which one may assign this light Infidelity. <i>Jack
Sippet</i> never keeps the Hour he has appointed to come to a Friend's to
Dinner; but he is an insignificant Fellow who does it out of Vanity. He
could never, he knows, make any Figure in Company, but by giving a
little Disturbance at his Entry, and therefore takes Care to drop in
when he thinks you are just seated. He takes his Place after having
discomposed every Body, and de<b>Sir</b> es there may be no Ceremony; then does
he begin to call himself the saddest Fellow, in disappointing so many
Places as he was invited to elsewhere. It is the Fop's Vanity to name
Houses of better Chear, and to acquaint you that he chose yours out of
ten Dinners which he was obliged to be at that Day. The last Time I had
the Fortune to eat with him, he was imagining how very fat he should
have been had he eaten all he had ever been invited to. But it is
impertinent to dwell upon the Manners of such a Wretch as obliges all
whom he disappoints, though his Circumstances constrain them to be civil
to him. But there are those that every one would be glad to see, who
fall into the same detestable Habit. It is a merciless thing that any
one can be at Ease, and suppose a Set of People who have a Kindness for
him, at that Moment waiting out of Respect to him, and refusing to taste
their Food or Conversation with the utmost Impatience. One of these
Promisers sometimes shall make his Excuses for not coming at all, so
late that half the Company have only to lament, that they have neglected
Matters of Moment to meet him whom they find a Trifler. They immediately
repent of the Value they had for him; and such Treatment repeated, makes
Company never depend upon his Promise any more; so that he often comes
at the Middle of a Meal, where he is secretly slighted by the Persons
with whom he eats, and cursed by the Servants, whose Dinner is delayed
by his prolonging their Master's Entertainment. It is wonderful, that
Men guilty this Way, could never have observed, that the whiling Time,
the gathering together, and waiting a little before Dinner, is the most
awkwardly passed away of any Part in the four and twenty Hours. If they
did think at all, they would reflect upon their Guilt, in lengthning
such a Suspension of agreeable Life. The constant offending this Way,
has, in a Degree, an Effect upon the Honesty of his Mind who is guilty
of it, as common Swearing is a kind of habitual Perjury: It makes the
Soul unattentive to what an Oath is, even while it utters it at the
Lips. <i>Phocion</i> beholding a wordy Orator while he was making a
magnificent Speech to the People full of vain Promises, <i>Methinks</i>, said
he, <i>I am now fixing my Eyes upon a Cypress Tree, it has all the Pomp
and Beauty imaginable in its Branches, Leaves, and Height, but alas it
bears no Fruit.</i><br>
<br>
Though the Expectation which is raised by impertinent Promisers is thus
barren, their Confidence, even after Failures, is so great, that they
subsist by still promising on. I have heretofore discoursed of the
insignificant Liar, the Boaster, and the Castle-Builder, and treated
them as no ill-designing Men, (tho' they are to be placed among the
frivolously false ones) but Persons who fall into that Way purely to
recommend themselves by their Vivacities; but indeed I cannot let
heedless Promisers, though in the most minute Circumstances, pass with
so slight a Censure. If a Man should take a Resolution to pay only Sums
above an hundred Pounds, and yet contract with different People Debts of
five and ten, how long can we suppose he will keep his Credit? This Man
will as long support his good Name in Business, as he will in
Conversation, who without Difficulty makes Assignations which he is
indifferent whether he keeps or not.<br>
<br>
I am the more severe upon this Vice, because I have been so unfortunate
as to be a very great Criminal my self. <b>Sir</b>  <b>Andrew Freeport</b>, and all
other my Friends who are scrupulous to Promises of the meanest
Consideration imaginable from an Habit of Virtue that way, have often
upbraided me with it. I take Shame upon my self for this Crime, and more
particularly for the greatest I ever committed of the Sort, that when as
agreeable a Company of Gentlemen and Ladies as ever were got together,
and I forsooth, Mr. SPECTATOR, to be of the Party with Women of Merit,
like a Booby as I was, mistook the time of Meeting, and came the Night
following. I wish every Fool who is negligent in this Kind, may have as
great a Loss as I had in this; for the same Company will never meet
more, but are dispersed into various Parts of the World, and I am left
under the Compunction that I deserve, in so many different Places to be
called a Trifler.<br>
<br>
This Fault is sometimes to be accounted for, when de<b>Sir</b> able People are
fearful of appearing precious and reserved by Denials; but they will
find the Apprehension of that Imputation will betray them into a
childish Impotence of Mind, and make them promise all who are so kind to
ask it of them. This leads such soft Creatures into the Misfortune of
seeming to return Overtures of Good-will with Ingratitude. The first
Steps in the Breach of a Man's Integrity are much more important than
Men are aware of. The Man who scruples breaking his Word in little
Things would not suffer in his own Conscience so great Pain for Failures
of Consequence, as he who thinks every little Offence against Truth and
Justice a Disparagement. We should not make any thing we our selves
disapprove habitual to us, if we would be sure of our Integrity.<br>
<br>
I remember a Falshood of the trivial Sort, tho' not in relation to
Assignations, that exposed a Man to a very uneasie Adventure. <i>Will.
Trap</i> and <i>Jack Stint</i> were Chamber-fellows in the <i>Inner-Temple</i> about
25 Years ago. They one Night sate in the Pit together at a Comedy, where
they both observed and liked the same young Woman in the Boxes. Their
Kindness for her entered both Hearts deeper than they imagined. <i>Stint</i>
had a good Faculty at writing Letters of Love, and made his Address
privately that way; while <i>Trap</i> proceeded in the ordinary Course, by
Money and her Waiting-Maid. The Lady gave them both Encouragement,
receiving <i>Trap</i> into the utmost Favour, and answering at the same time
<i>Stint's</i> Letters, and giving him appointments at third Places. <i>Trap</i>
began to suspect the Epistolary Correspondence of his Friend, and
discovered also that <i>Stint</i> opened all his Letters which came to their
common Lodgings, in order to form his own Assignations. After much
Anxiety and Restlessness, <i>Trap</i> came to a Resolution, which he thought
would break off their Commerce with one another without any hazardous
Explanation. He therefore writ a Letter in a feigned Hand to Mr. <i>Trap</i>
at his Chambers in the <i>Temple</i>. <i>Stint</i>, according to Custom, seized
and opened it, and was not a little surpriz'd to find the Inside
directed to himself, when, with great Perturbation of Spirit, he read as
follows.

<blockquote>  Mr. <i>Stint</i>,<br>
<br>
  You have gained a slight Satisfaction at the Expence of doing a very
  heinous Crime. At the Price of a faithful Friend you have obtained an
  inconstant Mistress. I rejoice in this Expedient I have thought of to
  break my Mind to you, and tell you, You are a base Fellow, by a Means
  which does not expose you to the Affront except you deserve it. I
  know, <b>Sir</b> , as criminal as you are, you have still Shame enough to
  avenge yourself against the Hardiness of any one that should publickly
  tell you of it. I therefore, who have received so many secret Hurts
  from you, shall take Satisfaction with Safety to my self. I call you
  Base, and you must bear it, or acknowledge it; I triumph over you that
  you cannot come at me; nor do I think it dishonourable to come in
  Armour to assault him, who was in Ambuscade when he wounded me.

  What need more be said to convince you of being guilty of the basest
  Practice imaginable, than that it is such as has made you liable to be
  treated after this Manner, while you your self cannot in your own
  Conscience but allow the Justice of the Upbraidings of <i>Your Injured
  Friend</i>,

  Ralph Trap.</blockquote>

<br>

When I reflect upon my Labours for the Publick, I cannot but observe,
that Part of the Species, of which I profess my self a Friend and
Guardian, is sometimes treated with Severity; that is, there are in my
Writings many Descriptions given of ill Persons, and not yet any direct
Encomium made of those who are good. When I was convinced of this Error,
I could not but immediately call to Mind several of the Fair Sex of my
Acquaintance, whose Characters deserve to be transmitted to Posterity in
Writings which will long outlive mine. But I do not think that a Reason
why I should not give them their Place in my Diurnal as long as it will
last. For the Service therefore of my Female Readers, I shall single out
some Characters of Maids, Wives and Widows, which deserve the Imitation
of the Sex. She who shall lead this small illustrious Number of Heroines
shall be the amiable <i>Fidelia</i>.<br>
<br>
Before I enter upon the particular Parts of her Character, it is
necessary to Preface, that she is the only Child of a decrepid Father,
whose Life is bound up in hers. This Gentleman has used <i>Fidelia</i> from
her Cradle with all the Tenderness imaginable, and has view'd her
growing Perfections with the Partiality of a Parent, that soon thought
her accomplished above the Children of all other Men, but never thought
she was come to the utmost Improvement of which she her self was
capable. This Fondness has had very happy Effects upon his own
Happiness, for she reads, she dances, she sings, uses her Spinet and
Lute to the utmost Perfection: And the Lady's Use of all these
Excellencies, is to divert the old Man in his easie Chair, when he is
out of the Pangs of a Chronical Distemper. <i>Fidelia</i> is now in the
twenty third Year of her Age; but the Application of many Lovers, her
vigorous time of Life, her quick Sense of all that is truly gallant and
elegant in the Enjoyment of a plentiful Fortune, are not able to draw
her from the Side of her good old Father. Certain it is, that there is
no kind of Affection so pure and angelick as that of a Father to a
Daughter. He beholds her both with, and without Regard to her Sex. In
Love to our Wives there is De<b>Sir</b> e, to our Sons there is Ambition; but in
that to our Daughters, there is something which there are no Words to
express. Her Life is designed wholly Domestick, and she is so ready a
Friend and Companion, that every thing that passes about a Man, is
accompanied with the Idea of her Presence. Her Sex also is naturally so
much exposed to Hazard, both as to Fortune and Innocence, that there is,
perhaps, a new Cause of Fondness arising from that Consideration also.
None but Fathers can have a true Sense of these sort of Pleasures and
Sensations; but my Familiarity with the Father of <i>Fidelia</i>, makes me
let drop the Words which I have heard him speak, and observe upon his
Tenderness towards her.<br>
<br>
<i>Fidelia</i> on her Part, as I was going to say, as accomplished as she is,
with all her Beauty, Wit, Air, and Mien, employs her whole Time in Care
and Attendance upon her Father. How have I been charmed to see one of
the most beauteous Women the Age has produced on her Knees helping on an
old Man's Slipper! Her filial Regard to him is what she makes her
Diversion, her Business, and her Glory. When she was asked by a Friend
of her deceased Mother to admit of the Courtship of her Son, she
answer'd, That she had a great Respect and Gratitude to her for the
Overture in Behalf of one so near to her, but that during her Father's
Life, she would admit into her Heart no Value for any thing that should
interfere with her Endeavour to make his Remains of Life as happy and
easie as could be expected in his Circumstances. The Lady admonished her
of the Prime of Life with a Smile; which <i>Fidelia</i> answered with a
Frankness that always attends unfeigned Virtue. <i>It is true, Madam,
there is to be sure very great Satisfactions to be expected in the
Commerce of a Man of Honour, whom one tenderly loves; but I find so much
Satisfaction in the Reflection, how much I mitigate a good Man's Pains,
whose Welfare depends upon my Assiduity about him, that I wittingly
exclude the loose Gratifications of Passion for the solid Reflections of
Duty. I know not whether any Man's Wife would be allow'd, and (what I
still more fear) I know not whether I, a Wife, should be willing to be
as officious as I am at present about my Parent</i>. The happy Father has
her Declaration that she will not marry during his Life, and the
Pleasure of seeing that Resolution not uneasie to her. Were one to paint
filial Affection in its utmost Beauty, he could not have a more lively
Idea of it than in beholding <i>Fidelia</i> serving her Father at his Hours
of Rising, Meals, and Rest.<br>
<br>
When the general Crowd of Female Youth are consulting their Glasses,
preparing for Balls, Assemblies, or Plays; for a young Lady, who could
be regarded among the foremost in those Places, either for her Person,
Wit, Fortune, or Conversation, and yet contemn all these Entertainments,
to sweeten the heavy Hours of a decrepid Parent, is a Resignation truly
heroick. <i>Fidelia</i> performs the Duty of a Nurse with all the Beauty of a
Bride; nor does she neglect her Person, because of her Attendance on
him, when he is too ill to receive Company, to whom she may make an
Appearance.<br>
<br>
<i>Fidelia</i>, who gives him up her Youth, does not think it any great
Sacrifice to add to it the Spoiling of her Dress. Her Care and Exactness
in her Habit, convince her Father of the Alacrity of her Mind; and she
has of all Women the best Foundation for affecting the Praise of a
seeming Negligence. What adds to the Entertainment of the good old Man
is, that <i>Fidelia</i>, where Merit and Fortune cannot be overlook'd by
Epistolary Lovers, reads over the Accounts of her Conquests, plays on
her Spinet the gayest Airs, (and while she is doing so, you would think
her formed only for Gallantry) to intimate to him the Pleasures she
despises for his Sake.<br>
<br>
Those who think themselves the Patterns of good Breeding and Gallantry,
would be astonished to hear that in those Intervals when the old
Gentleman is at Ease, and can bear Company, there are at his House in
the most regular Order, Assemblies of People of the highest Merit; where
there is Conversation without Mention of the Faults of the Absent,
Benevolence between Men and Women without Passion, and the highest
Subjects of Morality treated of as natural and accidental Discourse; All
which is owing to the Genius of <i>Fidelia</i>, who at once makes her
Father's Way to another World easie, and her self capable of being an
Honour to his Name in this.<br>

<br>
  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  All Men, through different Paths, make at the same common thing,
  <i>Money</i>; and it is to her we owe the Politician, the Merchant, and the
  Lawyer; nay, to be free with you, I believe to that also we are
  beholden for our <i>Spectator</i>. I am apt to think, that could we look
  into our own Hearts, we should see Money ingraved in them in more
  lively and moving Characters than Self-Preservation; for who can
  reflect upon the Merchant hoisting Sail in a doubtful Pursuit of her,
  and all Mankind sacrificing their Quiet to her, but must perceive that
  the Characters of Self-Preservation (which were doubtless originally
  the brightest) are sullied, if not wholly defaced; and that those of
  Money (which at first was only valuable as a Mean to Security) are of
  late so brightened, that the Characters of Self-Preservation, like a
  less Light set by a greater, are become almost imperceptible? Thus has
  Money got the upper Hand of what all Mankind formerly thought most
  dear, <i>viz</i>. Security; and I wish I could say she had here put a Stop
  to her Victories; but, alas! common Honesty fell a Sacrifice to her.
  This is the Way Scholastick Men talk of the greatest Good in the
  World; but I, a Tradesman, shall give you another Account of this
  Matter in the plain Narrative of my own Life. I think it proper, in
  the first Place, to acquaint my Readers, that since my setting out in
  the World, which was in the Year 1660, I never wanted Money; having
  begun with an indifferent good Stock in the Tobacco-Trade, to which I
  was bred; and by the continual Successes, it <a name="fr4501">has</a> pleased Providence to
  bless my Endeavours with, am at last arrived at what they call a
  <i>Plumb</i><a href="#f4501"><sup>1</sup></a>. To uphold my Discourse in the Manner of your Wits or
  Philosophers, by speaking fine things, or drawing Inferences, as they
  pretend, from the Nature of the Subject, I account it vain; having
  never found any thing in the Writings of such Men, that did not favour
  more of the Invention of the Brain, or what is styled Speculation,
  than of sound Judgment or profitable Observation. I will readily grant
  indeed, that there is what the Wits call Natural in their Talk; which
  is the utmost those curious Authors can assume to themselves, and is
  indeed all they endeavour at, for they are but lamentable Teachers.
  And, what, I pray, is Natural? That which is pleasing and easie: And
  what are Pleasing and Easie? Forsooth, a new Thought or Conceit
  dressed up in smooth quaint Language, to make you smile and wag your
  Head, as being what you never imagined before, and yet wonder why you
  had not; meer frothy Amusements! fit only for Boys or silly Women to
  be caught with.<br>
<br>
  'It is not my present Intention to instruct my Readers in the Methods
  of acquiring Riches; that may be the Work of another Essay; but to
  exhibit the real and solid Advantages I have found by them in my long
  and manifold Experience; nor yet all the Advantages of so worthy and
  valuable a Blessing, (for who does not know or imagine the Comforts of
  being warm or living at Ease? And that Power and Preheminence are
  their inseperable Attendants?) But only to instance the great Supports
  they afford us under the severest Calamities and Misfortunes; to shew
  that the Love of them is a special Antidote against Immorality and
  Vice, and that the same does likewise naturally dispose Men to Actions
  of Piety and Devotion: All which I can make out by my own Experience,
  who think my self no ways particular from the rest of Mankind, nor
  better nor worse by Nature than generally other Men are.<br>
<br>
  'In the Year 1665, when the Sickness was, I lost by it my Wife and two
  Children, which were all my Stock. Probably I might have had more,
  considering I was married between 4 and 5 Years; but finding her to be
  a teeming Woman, I was careful, as having then little above a Brace of
  thousand Pounds, to carry on my Trade and maintain a Family with. I
  loved them as usually Men do their Wives and Children, and therefore
  could not resist the first Impulses of Nature on so wounding a Loss;
  but I quickly roused my self, and found Means to alleviate, and at
  last conquer my Affliction, by reflecting how that she and her
  Children having been no great Expence to me, the best Part of her
  Fortune was still left; that my Charge being reduced to my self, a
  Journeyman, and a Maid, I might live far cheaper than before; and that
  being now a childless Widower, I might perhaps marry a no less
  deserving Woman, and with a much better Fortune than she brought,
  which was but &pound;800. And to convince my Readers that such
  Considerations as these were proper and apt to produce such an Effect,
  I remember it was the constant Observation at that deplorable Time,
  when so many Hundreds were swept away daily, that the Rich ever bore
  the Loss of their Families and Relations far better than the Poor; the
  latter having little or nothing before-hand, and living from Hand to
  Mouth, placed the whole Comfort and Satisfaction of their Lives in
  their Wives and Children, and were therefore inconsolable.<br>
<br>
  'The following Year happened the Fire; at which Time, by good
  Providence, it was my Fortune to have converted the greatest Part of
  my Effects into ready Money, on the Prospect of an extraordinary
  Advantage which I was preparing to lay Hold on. This Calamity was very
  terrible and astonishing, the Fury of the Flames being such, that
  whole Streets, at several distant Places, were destroyed at one and
  the same Time, so that (as it is well known) almost all our Citizens
  were burnt out of what they had. But what did I then do? I did not
  stand gazing on the Ruins of our noble Metropolis; I did not shake my
  Head, wring my Hands, sigh, and shed Tears; I consider'd with my self
  what could this avail; I fell a plodding what Advantages might be made
  of the ready Cash I had, and immediately bethought my self what
  wonderful Pennyworths might be bought of the Goods, that were saved
  out of the Fire. In short, with about &pound;2000 and a little Credit, I
  bought as much Tobacco as rais'd my Estate to the Value of &pound;10000 I
  then <i>looked on the Ashes of our City, and, the Misery of its late
  Inhabitants, as an Effect of the just Wrath and Indignation of Heaven
  towards a sinful and perverse People</i>.<br>
<br>
  'After this I married again, and that Wife dying, I took another; but
  both proved to be idle Baggages: the first gave me a great deal of
  Plague and Vexation by her Extravagancies, and I became one of the
  Bywords of the City. I knew it would be to no manner of Purpose to go
  about to curb the Fancies and Inclinations of Women, which fly out the
  more for being restrained; but what I could I did. I watched her
  narrowly, and by good Luck found her in the Embraces (for which I had
  two Witnesses with me) of a wealthy Spark of the Court-end of the
  Town; of whom I recovered 15000 Pounds, which made me Amends for what
  she had idly squanderd, and put a Silence to all my Neighbours, taking
  off my Reproach by the Gain they saw I had by it. The last died about
  two Years after I married her, in Labour of three Children. I
  conjecture they were begotten by a Country Kinsman of hers, whom, at
  her Recommendation, I took into my Family, and gave Wages to as a
  Journeyman. What this Creature expended in Delicacies and high Diet
  with her Kinsman (as well as I could compute by the Poulterers,
  Fishmongers, and Grocers Bills) amounted in the said two Years to one
  hundred eighty six Pounds, four Shillings, and five Pence Half-penny.
  The fine Apparel, Bracelets, Lockets, and Treats, &amp;c. of the other,
  according to the best Calculation, came in three Years and about three
  Quarters to Seven hundred forty four Pounds, seven Shillings and nine
  Pence. After this I resolv'd never to marry more, and found I had been
  a Gainer by my Marriages, and the Damages granted me for the Abuses of
  my Bed, (all Charges deducted) eight thousand three hundred Pounds
  within a Trifle.<br>
<br>
  'I come now to shew the good Effects of the Love of Money on the Lives
  of Men towards rendring them honest, sober, and religious. When I was
  a young Man, I had a Mind to make the best of my Wits, and
  over-reached a Country Chap in a Parcel of unsound Goods; to whom,
  upon his upbraiding, and threatning to expose me for it, I returned
  the Equivalent of his Loss; and upon his good Advice, wherein he
  clearly demonstrated the Folly of such Artifices, which can never end
  but in Shame, and the Ruin of all Correspondence, I never after
  transgressed. Can your Courtiers, who take Bribes, or your Lawyers or
  Physicians in their Practice, or even the Divines who intermeddle in
  worldly Affairs, boast of making but one Slip in their Lives, and of
  such a thorough and lasting Reformation? Since my coming into the
  World I do not remember I was ever overtaken in Drink, save nine
  times, one at the Christening of my first Child, thrice at our City
  Feasts, and five times at driving of Bargains. My Reformation I can
  attribute to nothing so much as the Love and Esteem of Money, for I
  found my self to be extravagant in my Drink, and apt to turn
  Projector, and make rash Bargains. As for Women, I never knew any,
  except my Wives: For my Reader must know, and it is what he may
  confide in as an excellent Recipe, That the Love of Business and Money
  is the greatest Mortifier of inordinate De<b>Sir</b> es imaginable, as
  employing the Mind continually in the careful Oversight of what one
  has, in the eager Quest after more, in looking after the Negligences
  and Deceits of Servants, in the due Entring and Stating of Accounts,
  in hunting after Chaps, and in the exact Knowledge of the State of
  Markets; which Things whoever thoroughly attends, will find enough and
  enough to employ his Thoughts on every Moment of the Day; So that I
  cannot call to Mind, that in all the Time I was a Husband, which, off
  and on, was about twelve Years, I ever once thought of my Wives but in
  Bed. And, lastly, for Religion, I have ever been a constant Churchman,
  both Forenoons and Afternoons on Sundays, never forgetting to be
  thankful for any Gain or Advantage I had had that Day; and on
  <i>Saturday</i> Nights, upon casting up my Accounts, I always was grateful
  for the Sum of my Week's Profits, and at <i>Christmas</i> for that of the
  whole Year. It is true, perhaps, that my Devotion has not been the
  most fervent; which, I think, ought to be imputed to the Evenness and
  Sedateness of my Temper, which never would admit of any Impetuosities
  of any Sort: And I can remember that in my Youth and Prime of Manhood,
  when my Blood ran brisker, I took greater Pleasure in Religious
  Exercises than at present, or many Years past, and that my Devotion
  sensibly declined as Age, which is dull and unwieldly, came upon me.<br>
<br>
'I have, I hope, here proved, that the Love of Money prevents all
  Immorality and Vice; which if you will not allow, you must, that the
  Pursuit of it obliges Men to the same Kind of Life as they would
  follow if they were really virtuous: Which is all I have to say at
  present, only recommending to you, that you would think of it, and
  turn ready Wit into ready Money as fast as you can. I conclude,<br>
<br>
  <i>Your Servant</i>, <br>
  Ephraim Weed.'</blockquote>

There is nothing so scandalous to a Government, and detestable in the
Eyes of all good Men, as defamatory Papers and Pamphlets; but at the
same time there is nothing so difficult to tame, as a Satyrical Author.
An angry Writer, who cannot appear in Print, naturally vents his Spleen
in Libels and Lampoons. A gay old Woman, says the Fable, seeing all her
Wrinkles represented in a large Looking-glass, threw it upon the Ground
in a Passion, and broke it into a thousand Pieces, but as she was
afterwards surveying the Fragments with a spiteful kind of Pleasure, she
could not forbear uttering her self in the following Soliloquy. What
have I got by this revengeful Blow of mine, I have only multiplied my
Deformity, and see an hundred ugly Faces, where before I saw but one.<br>
<br>
It has been proposed, <i>to oblige every Person that writes a Book, or a
Paper, to swear himself the Author of it, and enter down in a publick
Register his Name and Place of Abode</i>.<br>
<br>
This, indeed, would have effectually suppressed all printed Scandal,
which generally appears under borrowed Names, or under none at all. But
it is to be feared, that such an Expedient would not only destroy
Scandal, but Learning. It would operate promiscuously, and root up the
Corn and Tares together. Not to mention some of the most celebrated
Works of Piety, which have proceeded from Anonymous Authors, who have
made it their Merit to convey to us so great a Charity in secret: There
are few Works of Genius that come out at first with the Author's Name.
The Writer generally makes a Tryal of them in the World before he owns
them; and, I believe, very few, who are capable of Writing, would set
Pen to Paper, if they knew, before-hand, that they must not publish
their Productions but on such Conditions. For my own part, I must
declare, the Papers I present the Publick are like Fairy Favours, which
shall last no longer than while the Author is concealed.<br>
<br>
That which makes it particularly difficult to restrain these Sons of
Calumny and Defamation is, that all Sides are equally guilty of it, and
that every dirty Scribler is countenanced by great Names, whose
Interests he propagates by such vile and infamous Methods. I have never
yet heard of a Ministry, who have inflicted an exemplary Punishment on
an Author that has supported their Cause with Falsehood and Scandal, and
treated, in a most cruel manner, the names of those who have been looked
upon as their Rivals and Antagonists. Would a Government set an
everlasting Mark of their Displeasure upon one of those infamous
Writers, who makes his Court to them by tearing to Pieces the Reputation
of a Competitor, we should quickly see an End put to this Race of
Vermin, that are a Scandal to Government, and a Reproach to Human
Nature. Such a Proceeding would make a Minister of State shine in
History, and would fill all Mankind with a just Abhorrence of Persons
who should treat him unworthily, and employ against him those Arms which
he scorned to make use of against his Enemies.<br>
<br>
I cannot think that any one will be so unjust as to imagine, what I have
here said is spoken with a Respect to any Party or Faction. Every one
who has in him the Sentiments either of a Christian or a Gentleman,
cannot but be highly offended at this wicked and ungenerous Practice,
which is so much in use among us at present, that it is become a kind of
National Crime, and distinguishes us from all the Governments that lie
about us. I cannot but look upon the finest Strokes of Satyr which are
aimed at particular Persons, and which are supported even with the
Appearances of Truth, to be the Marks of an evil Mind, and highly
Criminal in themselves. Infamy, like other Punishments, is under the
Direction and Distribution of the Magistrate, and not of any private
Person. Accordingly we learn from a Fragment of <i>Cicero</i>, that tho'
there were very few Capital Punishments in the twelve Tables, a Libel or
Lampoon which took away the good Name of another, was to be punished by
Death. But this is far from being our Case. Our Satyr is nothing but
Ribaldry, and <i>Billingsgate</i>. Scurrility passes for Wit; and he who can
call Names in the greatest Variety of Phrases, is looked upon to have
the shrewdest Pen. By this Means the Honour of Families is ruined, the
highest Posts and greatest Titles are render'd cheap and vile in the
Sight of the People; the noblest Virtues, and most exalted Parts,
exposed to the Contempt of the Vicious and the Ignorant. Should a
Foreigner, who knows nothing of our private Factions, or one who is to
act his Part in the World when our present Heats and Animosities are
forgot, should, I say, such an one form to himself a Notion of the
greatest Men of all Sides in the <i>British</i> Nation, who are now living,
from the Characters which are given them in some or other of those
abominable Writings which are daily Published among us, what a Nation of
Monsters must we appear!<br>
<br>
As this cruel Practice tends to the utter Subversion of all Truth and
Humanity among us, it deserves the utmost Detestation and Discouragement
of all who have either the Love of their Country, or the Honour of their
Religion at Heart. I would therefore earnestly recommend it to the
Consideration of those who deal in these pernicious Arts of Writing; and
of those who take Pleasure in the Reading of them. As for the first, I
have spoken of them in former Papers, and have not stuck to rank them
with the Murderer and Assassin. Every honest Man sets as high a Value
upon a good Name, as upon Life it self; and I cannot but think that
those who privily assault the one, would destroy the other, might they
do it with the same Secrecy and Impunity.<br>
<br>
As for Persons who take Pleasure in the reading and dispersing of such
detestable Libels, I am afraid they fall very little short of the Guilt
of the first Composers. By a Law of the Emperors <i>Valentinian</i> and
<i>Valens</i>, it was made Death for any Person not only to write a Libel,
but if he met with one by chance, not to tear or burn it. But because I
would not be thought singular in my Opinion of this Matter, I shall
conclude my Paper with the Words of Monsieur <i>Bayle</i>, who was a Man of
great Freedom of Thought, as well as of exquisite Learning and Judgment.

<blockquote>  I <a name="fr4511">cannot</a> imagine, that a Man who disperses a Libel is less de<b>Sir</b> ous of
  doing Mischief than the Author himself. But what shall we say of the
  Pleasure which a Man takes in the reading of a Defamatory Libel? Is it
  not an heinous Sin in the Sight of God? We must distinguish in this
  Point. This Pleasure is either an agreeable Sensation we are afflicted
  with, when we meet with a witty Thought which is well expressed, or it
  is a Joy which we conceive from the Dishonour of the Person who is
  defamed. I will say nothing to the first of these Cases; for perhaps
  some would think that my Morality is not severe enough, if I should
  affirm that a Man is not Master of those agreeable Sensations, any
  more than of those occasioned by Sugar or Honey, when they touch his
  Tongue; but as to the second, every one will own that Pleasure to be a
  heinous Sin. The Pleasure in the first Case is of no Continuance; it
  prevents our Reason and Reflection, and may be immediately followed by
  a secret Grief, to see our Neighbour's Honour blasted. If it does not
  cease immediately, it is a Sign that we are not displeased with the
  Ill-nature of the Satyrist, but are glad to see him defame his Enemy
  by all kinds of Stories; and then we deserve the Punishment to which
  the Writer of the Libel is subject. I shall here add the Words of a
  Modern Author. <i>St</i>. Gregory <i>upon excommunicating those Writers who
  had dishonoured Castorius, does not except those who read their Works;
  because</i>, says he, <i>if Calumnies have always been the delight of the
  Hearers, and a gratification of those Persons who have no other
  Advantage over honest Men, is not he who takes Pleasure in reading
  them as guilty as he who composed them?</i> It is an uncontested Maxim,
  that they who approve an Action would certainly do it if they could;
  that is, if some Reason of Self-love did not hinder them. There is no
  difference, says <i>Cicero</i>, between advising a Crime, and approving it
  when committed. The <i>Roman</i> Law confirmed this Maxim, having subjected
  the Approvers and Authors of this Evil to the same Penalty. We may
  therefore conclude, that those who are pleased with reading Defamatory
  Libels, so far as to approve the Authors and Dispersers of them, are
  as guilty as if they had composed them: for if they do not write such
  Libels themselves, it is because they have not the Talent of Writing,
  or because they will run no hazard<a href="#f4511"><sup>1</sup></a>.</blockquote>

The Author produces other Authorities to confirm his Judgment in this
particular.<br>

There is no Humour in my Countrymen, which I am more enclined to wonder
at, than their general Thirst after News. There are about half a Dozen
Ingenious Men, who live very plentifully upon this Curiosity of their
Fellow-Subjects. They all of them receive the same Advices from abroad,
and very often in the same Words; but their Way of Cooking it is so
different, that there is no Citizen, who has an Eye to the publick Good,
that can leave the Coffee-house with Peace of Mind before he has given
every one of them a Reading. These several Dishes of News are so very
agreeable to the Palate of my Countrymen, that they are not only pleased
with them when they are served up hot, but when they are again set cold
before them, by those penetrating Politicians, who oblige the Publick
with their Reflections and Observations upon every piece of Intelligence
that is sent us from abroad. The Text is given us by one set of Writers,
and the Comment by another.<br>
<br>
But notwithstanding we have the same Tale told us in so many different
papers, and if occasion requires in so many Articles of the same Paper;
notwithstanding a Scarcity of Foreign Posts we hear the same Story
repeated, by different Advices from <i>Paris</i>, <i>Brussels</i>, the <i>Hague</i>,
and from every great Town in <i>Europe;</i> notwithstanding the Multitude of
Annotations, Explanations, Reflections, and various Readings which it
passes through, our Time lies heavy on our Hands till the Arrival of a
fresh Mail: We long to receive further particulars, to hear what will be
the next Step, or what will be the Consequences of that which has been
already taken. A Westerly Wind keeps the whole Town in Suspence, and
puts a Stop to Conversation.<br>
<br>
This general Curiosity has been raised and inflamed by our late Wars,
and, if rightly directed, might be of good Use to a Person who has such
a Thirst awakened in him. Why should not a Man, who takes Delight in
reading every thing that is new, apply himself to History, Travels, and
other Writings of the same kind, where he will find perpetual Fuel for
his Curiosity, and meet with much more Pleasure and Improvement, than in
these Papers of the Week? An honest Tradesman, who languishes a whole
Summer in Expectation of a Battel, and perhaps is balked at last, may
here meet with half a dozen in a Day. He may read the News of a whole
Campaign, in less time than he now bestows upon the Products of any
single Post. Fights, Conquests and Revolutions lye thick together. The
Reader's Curiosity is raised and satisfied every Moment, and his
Passions <a name="fr4521">disappointed</a> or gratified, without being detained in a State of
uncertainty from Day to Day, or lying at the Mercy of Sea <span style="color: #663300;">and</span><a href="#f4521"><sup>1</sup></a>
Wind. In short, the Mind is not here kept in a perpetual Gape after
Knowledge, nor punished with that Eternal Thirst, which is the Portion
of all our modern News-mongers and Coffee-house Politicians.<br>
<br>
All Matters of Fact, which a Man did not know before, are News to him;
and I do not see how any Haberdasher in <i>Cheapside</i> is more concerned in
the present Quarrel of the Cantons, than he was in that of the League.
At least, I believe every one will allow me, it is of more Importance to
an <i>Englishman</i> to know the History of his Ancestors, than that of his
Contemporaries who live upon the Banks of the <i>Danube</i> or the
<i>Borysthenes</i>. As for those who are of another Mind, I shall recommend
to them the following Letter, from a Projector, who is willing to turn a
Penny by this remarkable Curiosity of his Countrymen.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'You must have observed, that Men who frequent Coffee-houses, and
  delight in News, are pleased with every thing that is Matter of Fact,
  so it be what they have not heard before. A Victory, or a Defeat, are
  equally agreeable to them. The shutting of a Cardinal's Mouth pleases
  them one Post, and the opening of it another. They are glad to hear
  the <i>French</i> Court is removed to <i>Marli</i>, and are afterwards as much
  delighted with its Return to <i>Versailles</i>. They read the
  Advertisements with the same Curiosity as the Articles of publick
  News; and are as pleased to hear of a Pye-bald Horse that is stray'd
  out of a Field near <i>Islington</i>, as of a whole Troop that has been
  engaged in any Foreign Adventure. In short, they have a Relish for
  every thing that is News, let the matter of it be what it will; or to
  speak more properly, they are Men of a Voracious Appetite, but no
  Taste. Now, <b>Sir</b> , since the great Fountain of News, I mean the War, is
  very near being dried up; and since these Gentlemen have contracted
  such an inextinguishable Thirst after it; I have taken their Case and
  my own into Consideration, and have thought of a Project which may
  turn to the Advantage of us both. I have Thoughts of publishing a
  daily Paper, which shall comprehend in it all the most remarkable
  Occurences in every little Town, Village and Hamlet, that lye within
  ten Miles of <i>London</i>, or in other Words, within the Verge of the
  Penny-Post. I have pitched upon this Scene of Intelligence for two
  Reasons; first, because the Carriage of Letters will be very cheap;
  and secondly, because I may receive them every Day. By this means my
  Readers will have their News fresh and fresh, and many worthy Citizens
  who cannot Sleep with any Satisfaction at present, for want of being
  informed how the World goes, may go to Bed contentedly, it being my
  Design to put out my Paper every Night at nine-a-Clock precisely. I
  have already established Correspondences in these several Places, and
  received very good Intelligence.<br>
<br>
  By my last Advices from <i>Knights-bridge</i> I hear that a Horse was
  clapped into the Pound on the third Instant, and that he was not
  released when the Letters came away.<br>
<br>
  <a name="fr4522">We</a> are informed from <i>Pankridge</i><a href="#f4522"><sup>2</sup></a> that a dozen Weddings were lately
  celebrated in the Mother Church of that Place, but are referred to
  their next Letters for the Names of the Parties concerned.<br>
<br>
  Letters from <i>Brompton</i> advise. That the Widow <i>Bligh</i> had received
  several Visits from <i>John Milldew</i>, which affords great matter of
  Speculation in those Parts.<br>
<br>
  By a Fisherman which lately touched at <i>Hammersmith</i>, there is Advice
  from <i>Putney</i>, that a certain Person well known in that Place, is like
  to lose his Election for Church-warden; but this being Boat-news, we
  cannot give entire Credit to it.<br>
<br>
  Letters from <i>Paddington</i> bring little more, than that <i>William
  Squeak</i>, the Sow-gelder, passed through that Place the 5th Instant.<br>
<br>
  They advise from <i>Fulham</i>, that things remained there in the same
  State they were. They had Intelligence, just as the Letters came away,
  of a Tub of excellent Ale just set abroach at <i>Parson's Green</i>; but
  this wanted Confirmation.<br>
<br>
  I have here, <b>Sir</b> , given you a Specimen of the News with which I intend
  to entertain the Town, and which, when drawn up regularly in the Form
  of a News Paper, will, I doubt not, be very acceptable to many of
  those Publick-spirited Readers, who take more delight in acquainting
  themselves with other People's Business than their own. I hope a Paper
  of this kind, which lets us know what is done near home, may be more
  useful to us, than those which are filled with Advices from <i>Zug</i> and
  <i>Bender</i>, and make some amends for that Dearth of Intelligence, which
  we may justly apprehend from times of Peace. If I find that you
  receive this Project favourably, I will shortly trouble you with one
  or two more; and in the mean time am, most worthy <b>Sir</b> , with all due
  Respect,<br>
<br>
<i>Your most Obedient,<br>
  and most Humble Servant.</i></blockquote><br>

There is not a more pleasing Exercise of the Mind than Gratitude. It is
accompanied with such an inward Satisfaction, that the Duty is
sufficiently rewarded by the Performance. It is not like the Practice of
many other Virtues, difficult and painful, but attended with so much
Pleasure, that were there no positive Command which enjoin'd it, nor any
Recompence laid up for it hereafter, a generous Mind would indulge in
it, for the natural Gratification that accompanies it.<br>
<br>
If Gratitude is due from Man to Man, how much more from Man to his
Maker? The Supream Being does not only confer upon us those Bounties
which proceed more immediately from his Hand, but even those Benefits
which are conveyed to us by others. Every Blessing we enjoy, by what
Means soever it may be derived upon us, is the Gift of him who is the
great Author of Good, and Father of Mercies.<br>
<br>
If Gratitude, when exerted towards one another, naturally produces a
very pleasing Sensation in the Mind of a Grateful Man; it exalts the
Soul into Rapture, when it is employed on this great Object of
Gratitude; on this Beneficent Being who has given us every thing we
already possess, and from whom we expect every thing we yet hope for.<br>
<br>
Most of the Works of the Pagan Poets were either direct Hymns to their
Deities, or tended indirectly to the Celebration of their respective
Attributes and Perfections. Those who are acquainted with the Works of
the Greek and Latin Poets which are still extant, will upon Reflection
find this Observation so true, that I shall not enlarge upon it. One
would wonder that more of our Christian Poets have not turned their
Thoughts this way, especially if we consider, that our Idea of the
Supream Being is not only infinitely more Great and Noble than what
could possibly enter into the Heart of an Heathen, but filled with every
thing that can raise the Imagination, and give an Opportunity for the
sublimest Thoughts and Conceptions.<br>
<br>
<i>Plutarch</i> tells of a Heathen who was singing an Hymn to <i>Diana</i>, in
which he celebrated her for her Delight in Human Sacrifices, and other
Instances of Cruelty and Revenge; upon which a Poet who was present at
this piece of Devotion, and seems to have had a truer Idea of the Divine
Nature, told the Votary, by way of Reproof, that in recompence for his
Hymn, he heartily wished he might have a Daughter of the same Temper
with the Goddess he celebrated. It was indeed impossible to write the
Praises of one of those false Deities, according to the Pagan Creed,
without a mixture of Impertinence and Absurdity.<br>
<br>
The <i>Jews</i>, who before the Times of Christianity were the only People
that had the Knowledge of the True God, have set the Christian World an
Example how they ought to employ this Divine Talent of which I am
speaking. As that Nation produced Men of great Genius, without
considering them as inspired Writers, they have transmitted to us many
Hymns and Divine Odes, which excel those that are delivered down to us
by the Ancient <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i>, in the Poetry, as much as in the
Subject to which it was consecrated. This I think might easily be shewn,
if there were occasion for it.<br>
<br>
I have already communicated to the Publick some Pieces of Divine Poetry,
and as they have met with a very favourable Reception, I <a name="fr4531">shall</a> from time
to time publish any Work of the same nature which has not yet appeared
<span style="color: #663300;">in Print</span><a href="#f4531"><sup>1</sup></a>, and may be acceptable to my Readers.<br>

It is an inexpressible Pleasure to know a little of the World, and be of
no Character or Significancy in it. To be ever unconcerned, and ever
looking on new Objects with an endless Curiosity, is a Delight known
only to those who are turned for Speculation: Nay, they who enjoy it,
must value Things only as they are the Objects of Speculation, without
drawing any worldly Advantage to themselves from them, but just as they
are what contribute to their Amusement, or the Improvement of the Mind.
I lay one Night last Week at <i>Richmond</i>; and being restless, not out of
Dissatisfaction, but a certain busie Inclination one sometimes has, I
rose at Four in the Morning, and took Boat for <i>London</i>, with a
Resolution to rove by Boat and Coach for the next Four and twenty Hours,
till the many different Objects I must needs meet with should tire my
Imagination, and give me an Inclination to a Repose more profound than I
was at that Time capable of. I beg People's Pardon for an odd Humour I
am guilty of, and was often that Day, which is saluting any Person whom
I like, whether I know him or not. This is a Particularity would be
tolerated in me, if they considered that the greatest Pleasure I know I
receive at my Eyes, and that I am obliged to an agreeable Person for
coming abroad into my View, as another is for a Visit of Conversation at
their own Houses.<br>
<br>
The Hours of the Day and Night are taken up in the Cities of <i>London</i>
and <i>Westminster</i> by People as different from each other as those who
are born in different Centuries. Men of Six a Clock give way to those of
Nine, they of Nine to the Generation of Twelve, and they of Twelve
disappear, and make Room for the fashionable World, who have made Two a
Clock the Noon of the Day.<br>
<br>
When we first put off from Shore, we soon fell in with a Fleet of
Gardeners bound for the several Market-Ports of <i>London</i>; and it was the
most pleasing Scene imaginable to see the Chearfulness with which those
industrious People ply'd their Way to a certain Sale of their Goods. The
Banks on each Side are as well peopled, and beautified with as agreeable
Plantations, as any Spot on the Earth; but the <i>Thames</i> it self, loaded
with the Product of each Shore, added very much to the Landskip. It was
very easie to observe by their Sailing, and the Countenances of the
ruddy Virgins, who were Super-Cargoes, the Parts of the Town to which
they were bound. There was an Air in the Purveyors for <i>Covent-Garden</i>,
who frequently converse with Morning Rakes, very unlike the seemly
Sobriety of those bound for <i>Stocks Market</i>.<br>
<br>
Nothing remarkable happened in our Voyage; but I landed
with Ten Sail of Apricock Boats at <i>Strand-Bridge</i>, after having
put in at <i>Nine-Elms</i>, and taken in Melons, consigned by
Mr. <i>Cuffe</i> of that Place, to <i>Sarah Sewell</i> and Company, at
their Stall in <i>Covent-Garden</i>. We arrived at <i>Strand-Bridge</i> at
Six of the Clock, and were unloading: when the Hackney Coachmen
of the foregoing Night took their leave of each other
at the <i>Dark-House</i>, to go to Bed before the Day was too far
spent, Chimney-Sweepers pass'd by us as we made up to the
Market, and some Raillery happened between one of the Fruit
Wenches and those black Men, about the Devil and <i>Eve</i>, with
Allusion to their several Professions. I could not believe any
Place more entertaining than <i>Covent-Garden</i>; where I strolled
from one Fruit-Shop to another, with Crowds of agreeable
young Women around me, who were purchasing Fruit for their
respective Families. It was almost eight of the Clock before
I could leave that Variety of Objects. I took Coach and
followed a Young Lady, who tripped into another just before
me, attended by her Maid. I saw immediately she was of the
Family of the <i>Vainloves</i>. There are a set of these who of all
Things affect the Play of <i>Blindman's-Buff</i>, and leading Men
into Love for they know not whom, who are fled they know
not where. This sort of Woman is usually a janty Slattern;
she hangs on her Cloaths, plays her Head, varies her Posture,
and changes Place incessantly, and all with an Appearance of
striving at the same time to hide her self, and yet give you to
understand she is in Humour to laugh at you. You must have
often seen the Coachmen make Signs with their Fingers as
they drive by each other, to intimate how much they have got
that Day. They can carry on that Language to give Intelligence
where they are driving. In an Instant my Coachman
took the Wink to pursue, and the Lady's Driver gave the Hint
that he was going through <i>Long-Acre</i> towards St. <i>James's</i>:
While he whipped up <i>James-Street</i>, we drove for <i>King-Street</i>,
to save the Pass at St. <i>Martin's-Lane</i>. The Coachmen took
care to meet, jostle, and threaten each other for Way, and be
entangled at the End of <i>Newport-Street</i> and <i>Long-Acre</i>. The 
Fright, you must believe, brought down the Lady's Coach
Door, and obliged her, with her Mask off, to enquire into the
Bustle, when she sees the Man she would avoid. The Tackle
of the Coach-Window is so bad she cannot draw it up again,
and she drives on sometimes wholly discovered, and sometimes 
half escaped, according to the Accident of Carriages in
her Way. One of these Ladies keeps her Seat in a Hackney-Coach, 
as well as the best Rider does on a managed Horse.
The laced Shooe of her left Foot, with a careless Gesture, just
appearing on the opposite Cushion, held her both firm, and in
a proper Attitude to receive the next Jolt.<br>
<br>
As she was an excellent Coach Woman, many were the Glances at each other
which we had for an Hour and an Half in all Parts of the Town by the
Skill of our Drivers; till at last my Lady was conveniently lost with
Notice from her Coachman to ours to make off, and he should hear where
she went. This Chase was now at an End, and the Fellow who drove her
came to us, and discovered that he was ordered to come again in an Hour,
for that she was a Silk-Worm. I was surprized with this Phrase, but
found it was a Cant among the Hackney Fraternity for their best
Customers, Women who ramble twice or thrice a Week from Shop to Shop, to
turn over all the Goods in Town without buying any thing. The Silk-worms
are, it seems, indulged by the Tradesmen; for tho' they never buy, they
are ever talking of new Silks, Laces and Ribbands, and serve the Owners
in getting them Customers as their common Dunners do in making them pay.<br>
<br>
The Day of People of Fashion began now to Break, and Carts and Hacks
were mingled with Equipages of Show and Vanity; when I resolved to walk
it out of Cheapness; but my unhappy Curiosity is such, that I find it
always my Interest to take Coach, for some odd Adventure among Beggars,
Ballad-Singers, or the like, detains and throws me into Expence. It
happened so immediately; for at the Corner of <i>Warwick Street</i>, as I was
listening to a new Ballad, a ragged Rascal, a Beggar who knew me, came
up to me, and began to turn the Eyes of the good Company upon me, by
telling me he was extream Poor, and should die in the Street for want of
Drink, except I immediately would have the Charity to give him Six-pence
to go into the next Ale-house and save his Life. He urged, with a
melancholy Face, that all his Family had died of Thirst. All the Mob
have Humour, and two or three began to take the Jest; by which Mr.
<i>Sturdy</i> carried his Point, and let me sneak off to a Coach. As I drove
along, it was a pleasing Reflection to see the World so prettily
chequered since I left <i>Richmond</i>, and the Scene still filling with
Children of a new Hour. This Satisfaction encreased as I moved towards
the City; and gay Signs, well disposed Streets, magnificent publick
Structures, and wealthy Shops, adorned with contented Faces, made the
Joy still rising till we came into the Centre of the City, and Centre of
the World of Trade, the <i>Exchange</i> of <i>London</i>. As other men in the
Crowds about me were pleased with their Hopes and Bargains, I found my
Account in observing them, in Attention to their several Interests. I,
indeed, looked upon my self as the richest Man that walked the
<i>Exchange</i> that Day; for my Benevolence made me share the Gains of every
Bargain that was made. It was not the least of my Satisfactions in my
Survey, to go up Stairs, and pass the Shops of agreeable Females; to
observe so many pretty Hands busie in the Foldings of Ribbands, and the
utmost Eagerness of agreeable Faces in the sale of Patches, Pins, and
Wires, on each Side the Counters, was an Amusement, in which I should
longer have indulged my self, had not the dear Creatures called to me to
ask what I wanted, when I could not answer, only <i>To look at you</i>. I
went to one of the Windows which opened to the Area below, where all the
several Voices lost their Distinction, and rose up in a confused
Humming; which created in me a Reflection that could not come into the
Mind of any but of one a little too studious; for I said to my self,
with a kind of Pun in Thought, <i>What Nonsense is all the Hurry of this
World to those who are above it?</i> In these, or not much wiser Thoughts,
I had like to have lost my Place at the Chop-House, where every Man
according to the natural Bashfulness or Sullenness of our Nation, eats
in a publick Room a Mess of Broth, or Chop of Meat, in dumb Silence, as
if they had no pretence to speak to each other on the Foot of being Men,
except they were of each other's Acquaintance.<br>
<br>
I went afterwards to <i>Robin's</i>, and saw People who had dined with me at
the Five-penny Ordinary just before, give Bills for the Value of large
Estates; and could not but behold with great Pleasure, Property lodged
in, and transferred in a Moment from such as would never be Masters of
half as much as is seemingly in them, and given from them every Day they
live. But before Five in the Afternoon I left the City, came to my
common Scene of <i>Covent-Garden</i>, and passed the Evening at <i>Will's</i> in
attending the Discourses of several Sets of People, who relieved each
other within my Hearing on the Subjects of Cards, Dice, Love, Learning,
and Politicks. The last Subject kept me till I heard the Streets in the
Possession of the Bellman, who had now the World to himself, and cry'd,
<i>Past Two of Clock</i>. This rous'd me from my Seat, and I went to my
Lodging, led by a Light, whom I put into the Discourse of his private
&&oelig;lig;conomy, and made him give me an Account of the Charge, Hazard, Profit
and Loss of a Family that depended upon a Link, with a Design to end my
trivial Day with the Generosity of Six-pence, instead of a third Part of
that Sum. When I came to my Chambers I writ down these Minutes; but was
at a Loss what Instruction I should propose to my Reader from the
Enumeration of so many Insignificant Matters and Occurrences; and I
thought it of great Use, if they could learn with me to keep their Minds
open to Gratification, and ready to receive it from any thing it meets
with. This one Circumstance will make every Face you see give you the
Satisfaction you now take in beholding that of a Friend; will make every
Object a pleasing one; will make all the Good which arrives to any Man,
an Encrease of Happiness to your self.<br>

The following Letters have in them Reflections which will seem of
Importance both to the Learned World and to Domestick Life. There is in
the first an Allegory so well carry'd on, that it cannot but be very
pleasing to those who have a Taste of good Writing; and the other
Billets may have their Use in common Life.<br>

<blockquote>  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  As I walked t'other Day in a fine Garden, and observed the great
  Variety of Improvements in Plants and Flowers beyond what they
  otherwise would have been, I was naturally led into a Reflection upon
  the Advantages of Education, or Moral Culture; how many good Qualities
  in the Mind are lost, for want of the like due Care in nursing and
  skilfully managing them, how many Virtues are choaked, by the
  Multitude of Weeds which are suffered to grow among them; how
  excellent Parts are often starved and useless, by being planted in a
  wrong Soil; and how very seldom do these Moral Seeds produce the noble
  Fruits which might be expected from them, by a Neglect of proper
  Manuring, necessary Pruning, and an artful Management of our tender
  Inclinations and first Spring of Life: These obvious Speculations made
  me at length conclude, that there is a sort of vegetable Principle in
  the Mind of every Man when he comes into the World. In Infants the
  Seeds lie buried and undiscovered, till after a while they sprout
  forth in a kind of rational <i>Leaves</i>, which are <i>Words</i>; and in due
  Season the <i>Flowers</i> begin to appear in Variety of beautiful Colours,
  and all the gay Pictures of youthful Fancy and Imagination; at last
  the Fruit knits and is formed, which is green, perhaps, first, and
  soure, unpleasant to the Taste, and not fit to be gathered; till
  ripened by due Care and Application, it discovers itself in all the
  noble Productions of Philosophy, Mathematicks, close Reasoning, and
  handsome Argumentation: And these Fruits, when they arrive at a just
  Maturity, and are of a good Kind, afford the most vigorous Nourishment
  to the Minds of Men. I reflected further on the intellectual Leaves
  beforementioned, and found almost as great a Variety among them as in
  the vegetable World. I could easily observe the smooth shining
  <i>Italian</i> Leaves; the nimble <i>French</i> Aspen always in Motion; the
  <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i> Evergreens, the <i>Spanish</i> Myrtle, the <i>English</i>
  Oak, the <i>Scotch</i> Thistle, the <i>Irish</i> Shambrogue, the prickly
  <i>German</i> and <i>Dutch</i> Holly, the <i>Polish</i> and <i>Russian</i> Nettle, besides
  a vast Number of Exoticks imported from <i>Asia</i>, <i>Africk</i>, and
  <i>America</i>. I saw several barren Plants, which bore only Leaves,
  without any Hopes of Flower or Fruit: The Leaves of some were fragrant
  and well-shaped, of others ill-scented and irregular. I wonder'd at a
  Set of old whimsical Botanists, who spent their whole Lives in the
  Contemplation of some withered <i>&AElig;gyptian</i>, <i>Coptick</i>, <i>Armenian</i>, or
  <i>Chinese</i> Leaves, while others made it their Business to collect in
  voluminous Herbals all the several Leaves of some one Tree. The
  Flowers afforded a most diverting Entertainment, in a wonderful
  Variety of Figures, Colours and Scents; however, most of them withered
  soon, or at best are but <i>Annuals</i>. Some professed Florists make them
  their constant Study and Employment, and despise all Fruit; and now
  and then a few fanciful People spend all their Time in the Cultivation
  of a single Tulip, or a Carnation: But the most agreeable Amusement
  seems to be the well chusing, mixing, and binding together these
  Flowers, in pleasing Nosegays to present to Ladies. The Scent of
  <i>Italian</i> Flowers is observed, like their other Perfume, to be too
  strong, and to hurt the Brain; that of the <i>French</i> with glaring,
  gaudy Colours, yet faint and languid; <i>German</i> and <i>Northern</i> Flowers
  have little or no Smell, or sometimes an unpleasant one. The Antients
  had a Secret to give a lasting Beauty, Colour, and Sweetness to some
  of their choice Flowers, which flourish to this Day, and which few of
  the Moderns can effect. These are becoming enough and agreeable in
  their Season, and do often handsomely adorn an Entertainment, but an
  Over-fondness of them seems to be a Disease. It rarely happens to find
  a Plant vigorous enough, to have (like an Orange-Tree) at once
  beautiful shining Leaves, fragrant Flowers, and delicious nourishing
  Fruit.<br>

<br>
  <i>Dear</i> SPEC,<br>
<br>
  You have given us in your <i>Spectator</i> of <i>Saturday</i> last, a very
  excellent Discourse upon the Force of Custom, and its wonderful
  Efficacy in making every thing pleasant to us. I cannot deny but that
  I received above Two penny-worth of Instruction from your Paper, and
  in the general was very well pleased with it; but I am, without a
  Compliment, sincerely troubled that I cannot exactly be of your
  Opinion, That it makes every thing pleasing to us. In short, I have
  the Honour to be yoked to a young Lady, who is, in plain English, for
  her Standing, a very eminent Scold. She began to break her Mind very
  freely both to me and to her Servants about two Months after our
  Nuptials; and tho' I have been accustomed to this Humour of hers this
  three Years, yet, I do not know what's the Matter with me, but I am no
  more delighted with it than I was at the very first. I have advised
  with her Relations about her, and they all tell me that her Mother and
  her Grandmother before her were both taken much after the same Manner;
  so that since it runs in the Blood, I have but small Hopes of her
  Recovery. I should be glad to have a little of your Advice in this
  Matter: I would not willingly trouble you to contrive how it may be a
  Pleasure to me; if you will but put me in a Way that I may bear it
  with Indifference, I shall rest satisfied.<br>
<br>
  <i>Dear</i> SPEC,

  <i>Your very humble Servant</i>.<br>
<br>
  <i>P. S.</i> I must do the poor Girl the Justice to let you know, that this
  Match was none of her own chusing, (or indeed of mine either;) in
  Consideration of which I avoid giving her the least Provocation; and
  indeed we live better together than usually Folks do who hated one
  another when they were first joined: To evade the Sin against Parents,
  or at least to extenuate it, my Dear rails at my Father and Mother,
  and I curse hers for making the Match.<br>
<br>

<br>
  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  I like the Theme you lately gave out extremely, and should be as glad
  to handle it as any Man living: But I find myself no better qualified
  to write about Money, than about my Wife; for, to tell you a Secret
  which I de<b>Sir</b> e may go no further, I am Master of neither of those
  Subjects.<br>

  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  I de<b>Sir</b> e you would print this in <i>Italick</i>, so as it may be generally
  taken Notice of. It is designed only to admonish all Persons, who
  speak either at the Bar, Pulpit, or any publick Assembly whatsoever,
  how they discover their Ignorance in the Use of Similes. There are in
  the Pulpit it self, as well as other Places, such gross Abuses in this
  Kind, that I give this Warning to all I know, I shall bring them for
  the Future before your Spectatorial Authority. On <i>Sunday</i> last, one,
  who shall be nameless, reproving several of his Congregation for
  standing at Prayers, was pleased to say, <i>One would think</i>, like the

<br>

<b>Otway</b>, in his Tragedy of <i>Venice Preserv'd</i>, has described the Misery of
a Man, whose Effects are in the Hands of the Law, with great Spirit. The
Bitterness of being the Scorn and Laughter of base Minds, the Anguish of
being insulted by Men hardened beyond the Sense of Shame or Pity, and
the Injury of a Man's Fortune being wasted, under Pretence of Justice,
<a name="fr4561">are</a> excellently aggravated in the following Speech of <i>Pierre</i> to
<i>Faffeir</i><a href="#f4561"><sup>1</sup></a>:

<blockquote><i>I pass'd this very Moment by thy Doors,<br>
And found them guarded by a Troop of Villains:<br>
The Sons of publick Rapine were destroying.<br>
They told me, by the Sentence of the Law,<br>
They had Commission to seize all thy Fortune:<br>
Nay more</i>, Priuli's <i>cruel Hand had sign'd it.<br>
Here stood a Ruffian with a horrid Face,<br>
Lording it o'er a Pile of massy Plate,<br>
Tumbled into a Heap for publick Sale.<br>
There was another making villanous Jests<br>
At thy Undoing: He had ta'en Possession<br>
Of all thy ancient most domestick Ornaments:<br>
Rich Hangings intermix'd and wrought with Gold;<br>
The very Bed, which on thy Wedding Night<br>
Received thee to the Arms of</i> Belvedira,<br>
<i>The Scene of all thy Joys, was violated<br>
By the coarse Hands of filthy Dungeon Villains,<br>
And thrown amongst the common Lumber.</i></blockquote>

Nothing indeed can be more unhappy than the Condition of Bankrupcy. The
Calamity which happens to us by ill Fortune, or by the Injury of others,
has in it some Consolation; but what arises from our own Misbehaviour or
Error, is the State of the most exquisite Sorrow. When a Man considers
not only an ample Fortune, but even the very Necessaries of Life, his
Pretence to Food it self at the Mercy of his Creditors, he cannot but
look upon himself in the State of the Dead, with his Case thus much
worse, that the last Office is performed by his Adversaries, instead of
his Friends. From this Hour the cruel World does not only take
Possession of his whole Fortune, but even of every thing else, which had
no Relation to it. All his indifferent Actions have new Interpretations
put upon them; and those whom he has favoured in his former Life,
discharge themselves of their Obligations to him, by joining in the
Reproaches of his Enemies. It is almost incredible that it should be so;
but it is too often seen that there is a Pride mixed with the Impatience
of the Creditor, and there are who would rather recover their own by the
Downfal of a prosperous Man, than be discharged to the common
Satisfaction of themselves and their Creditors. The wretched Man, who
was lately Master of Abundance, is now under the Direction of others;
and the Wisdom, &&oelig;lig;conomy, good Sense and Skill in human Life before, by
reason of his present Misfortune, are of no Use to him in the
Disposition of any thing. The Incapacity of an Infant or a Lunatick, is
designed for his Provision and Accommodation; but that of a Bankrupt,
without any Mitigation in respect of the Accidents by which it arrived,
is calculated for his utter Ruin, except there be a Remainder ample
enough after the Discharge of his Creditors to bear also the Expence of
rewarding those by whose Means the Effect of all his Labours was
transferred from him. This Man is to look on and see others giving
Directions upon what Terms and Conditions his Goods are to be purchased,
and all this usually done not with an Air of Trustees to dispose of his
Effects, but Destroyers to divide and tear them to Pieces.<br>
<br>
There is something sacred in Misery to great and good Minds; for this
Reason all wise Lawgivers have been extremely tender how they let loose
even the Man who has Right on his Side, to act with any Mixture of
Resentment against the Defendant. Virtuous and modest Men, though they
be used with some Artifice, and have it in their Power to avenge
themselves, are slow in the Application of that Power, and are ever
constrained to go into rigorous Measures. They are careful to
demonstrate themselves not only Persons injured, but also that to bear
it longer, would be a Means to make the Offender injure others, before
they proceed. Such Men clap their Hands upon their Hearts, and consider
what it is to have at their Mercy the Life of a Citizen. Such would have
it to say to their own Souls, if possible, That they were merciful when
they could have destroyed, rather than when it was in their Power to
have spared a Man, they destroyed. This is a Due to the common Calamity
of Human Life, due in some measure to our very Enemies. They who scruple
doing the least Injury, are cautious of exacting the utmost Justice.<br>
<br>
Let any one who is conversant in the Variety of Human Life reflect upon
it, and he will find the Man who wants Mercy has a Taste of no Enjoyment
of any Kind. There is a natural Disrelish of every thing which is good
in his very Nature, and he is born an Enemy to the World. He is ever
extremely partial to himself in all his Actions, and has no Sense of
Iniquity but from the Punishment which shall attend it. The Law of the
Land is his Gospel, and all his Cases of Conscience are determined by
his Attorney. Such Men know not what it is to gladden the Heart of a
miserable Man, that Riches are the Instruments of serving the Purposes
of Heaven or Hell, according to the Disposition of the Possessor. The
wealthy can torment or gratifie all who are in their Power, and chuse to
do one or other as they are affected with Love or Hatred to Mankind. As
for such who are insensible of the Concerns of others, but merely as
they affect themselves, these Men are to be valued only for their
Mortality, and as we hope better Things from their Heirs. I could not
but read with great Delight a Letter from an eminent Citizen, who has
failed, to one who was intimate with him in his better Fortune, and able
by his Countenance to retrieve his lost Condition.

<blockquote>  <b>Sir</b> ,<br>
<br>
  It is in vain to multiply Words and make Apologies for what is never
  to be defended by the best Advocate in the World, the Guilt of being
  Unfortunate. All that a Man in my Condition can do or say, will be
  received with Prejudice by the Generality of Mankind, but I hope not
  with you: You have been a great Instrument in helping me to get what I
  have lost, and I know (for that Reason, as well as Kindness to me) you
  cannot but be in pain to see me undone. To shew you I am not a Man
  incapable of bearing Calamity, I will, though a poor Man, lay aside
  the Distinction between us, and talk with the Frankness we did when we
  were nearer to an Equality: As all I do will be received with
  Prejudice, all you do will be looked upon with Partiality. What I
  de<b>Sir</b> e of you, is, that you, who are courted by all, would smile upon
  me who am shunned by all. Let that Grace and Favour which your Fortune
  throws upon you, be turned to make up the Coldness and Indifference
  that is used towards me. All good and generous Men will have an Eye of
  Kindness for me for my own Sake, and the rest of the World will regard
  me for yours. There is an happy Contagion in Riches, as well as a
  destructive one in Poverty; the Rich can make rich without parting
  with any of their Store, and the Conversation of the Poor makes Men
  poor, though they borrow nothing of them. How this is to be accounted
  for I know not? but Men's Estimation follows us according to the
  Company we keep. If you are what you were to me, you can go a great
  Way towards my Recovery; if you are not, my good Fortune, if ever it
  returns, will return by slower Approaches.<br>
<br>
  <i>I am <b>Sir</b> ,<br>
  Your Affectionate Friend,<br>
  and Humble Servant.</i>
</blockquote>

This was answered with a Condescension that did not, by long impertinent
Professions of Kindness, insult his Distress, but was as follows.

<blockquote>  <i>Dear Tom</i>,<br>
<br>
  I am very glad to hear that you have Heart enough to begin the World a
  second Time. I assure you, I do not think your numerous Family at all
  diminished (in the Gifts of Nature for which I have ever so much
  admired them) by what has so lately happened to you. I shall not only
  countenance your Affairs with my Appearance for you, but shall
  accommodate you with a considerable Sum at common Interest for three
  Years. You know I could make more of it; but I have so great a Love
  for you that I can wave Opportunities of Gain to help you: For I do
  not care whether they say of me after I am dead, that I had an hundred
  or fifty thousand Pounds more than I wanted when I was living.<br>

  <i>Your obliged humble Servant</i>.</blockquote>

I shall this Day lay before my Reader a Letter, written by the same Hand
with that of last Friday, which contained Proposals for a Printed
News-paper, that should take in the whole Circle of the Penny-Post.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote><b>Sir</b> ,<br>
<br>
  The kind Reception you gave my last Friday's Letter, in which I
  broached my Project of a News-Paper, encourages me to lay before you
  two or three more; for, you must know, <b>Sir</b> , that we look upon you to
  be the <i>Lowndes</i> of the learned World, and cannot think any Scheme
  practicable or rational before you have approved of it, tho' all the
  Money we raise by it is on our own Funds, and for our private Use.<br>
<br>
  I have often thought that a <i>News-Letter of Whispers</i>, written every
  Post, and sent about the Kingdom, after the same Manner as that of Mr.
  <i>Dyer</i>, Mr. <i>Dawkes</i>, or any other Epistolary Historian, might be
  highly gratifying to the Publick, as well as beneficial to the Author.
  By Whispers I mean those Pieces of News which are communicated as
  Secrets, and which bring a double Pleasure to the Hearer; first, as
  they are private History, and in the next place as they have always in
  them a Dash of Scandal. <a name="fr4571">These</a> are the two chief Qualifications in an
  Article of News, <span style="color: #663300;">which</span><a href="#f4571"><sup>1</sup></a> recommend it, in a more than ordinary
  Manner, to the Ears of the Curious. Sickness of Persons in high Posts,
  Twilight Visits paid and received by Ministers of State, Clandestine
  Courtships and Marriages, Secret Amours, Losses at Play, Applications
  for Places, with their respective Successes or Repulses, are the
  Materials in which I chiefly intend to deal. I have two Persons, that
  are each of them the Representative of a Species, who are to furnish
  me with those Whispers which I intend to convey to my Correspondents.
  The first of these is <i>Peter Hush</i>, descended from the ancient Family
  of the <i>Hushes</i>. The other is the old Lady <i>Blast</i>, who has a very
  numerous Tribe of Daughters in the two great Cities of <i>London</i> and
  <i>Westminster</i>. <i>Peter Hush</i> has a whispering Hole in most of the great
  Coffee-houses about Town. If you are alone with him in a wide Room, he
  carries you up into a Corner of it, and speaks in your Ear. I have
  seen <i>Peter</i> seat himself in a Company of seven or eight Persons, whom
  he never saw before in his Life; and after having looked about to see
  there was no one that overheard him, has communicated to them in a low
  Voice, and under the Seal of Secrecy, the Death of a great Man in the
  Country, who was <a name="fr4572">perhaps</a> a Fox-hunting the very Moment this Account
  was <span style="color: #663300;">given</span><a href="#f4572"><sup>2</sup></a> of him. If upon your entring into a Coffee-house you
  see a Circle of Heads bending over the Table, and lying close by one
  another, it is ten to one but my Friend <i>Peter</i> is among them. I have
  known <i>Peter</i> publishing the Whisper of the Day by eight a-Clock in
  the Morning at <i>Garraway's</i>, by twelve at <i>Will's</i>, and before two at
  the <i>Smyrna</i>. When <i>Peter</i> has thus effectually launched a Secret, I
  have been very well pleased to hear People whispering it to one
  another at second Hand, and spreading it about as their own; for you
  must know, <b>Sir</b> , the great Incentive to Whispering is the Ambition
  which every one has of being thought in the Secret, and being look'd
  upon as a Man who has Access to greater People than one would imagine.
  After having given you this Account of <i>Peter Hush</i>, I proceed to that
  virtuous Lady, the old Lady <i>Blast</i>, who is to communicate to me the
  private Transactions of the Crimp Table, with all the <i>Arcana</i> of the
  Fair Sex. The Lady <i>Blast</i>, you must understand, has such a particular
  Malignity in her Whisper, that it blights like an Easterly Wind, and
  withers every Reputation that it breathes upon. She has a particular
  Knack at making private Weddings, and last Winter married above five
  Women of Quality to their Footmen. Her Whisper can make an innocent
  young Woman big with Child, or fill an healthful young Fellow with
  Distempers that are not to be named. She can turn a Visit into an
  Intrigue, and a distant Salute into an Assignation. She can beggar the
  Wealthy, and degrade the Noble. In short, she can whisper Men Base or
  Foolish, Jealous or Ill-natured, or, if Occasion requires, can tell
  you the Slips of their Great Grandmothers, and traduce the Memory of
  honest Coachmen that have been in their Graves above these hundred
  Years. By these and the like Helps, I question not but I shall furnish
  out a very handsome News-Letter. If you approve my Project, I shall
  begin to whisper by the very next Post, and question not but every one
  of my Customers will be very well pleased with me, when he considers
  that every Piece of News I send him is a Word in his Ear, and lets him
  into a Secret.<br>
<br>
  Having given you a Sketch of this Project, I shall, in the next Place,
  suggest to you another for a Monthly Pamphlet, which I shall likewise
  submit to your Spectatorial Wisdom. I need not tell you, <b>Sir</b> , that
  there are several Authors in <i>France</i>, <i>Germany</i>, and <i>Holland</i>, as
  well as in our own Country, who publish every Month, what they call
  <i>An Account of the Works of the Learned</i>, in which they give us an
  Abstract of all such Books as are printed in any Part of <i>Europe</i>.
  Now, <b>Sir</b> , it is my Design to publish every Month, <i>An Account of the
  Works of the Unlearned</i>. Several late Productions of my own
  Countrymen, who many of them make a very eminent Figure in the
  Illiterate World, Encourage me in this Undertaking. I may, in this
  Work, possibly make a Review of several Pieces which have appeared in
  the Foreign <i>Accounts</i> above-mentioned, tho' they ought not to have
  been taken Notice of in Works which bear such a Title. I may,
  likewise, take into Consideration, such Pieces as appear, from time to
  time, under the Names of those Gentlemen who Compliment one another,
  in Publick Assemblies, by the Title of the <i>Learned Gentlemen</i>. Our
  Party-Authors will also afford me a great Variety of Subjects, not to
  mention Editors, Commentators, and others, who are often Men of no
  Learning, or, what is as bad, of no Knowledge. I shall not enlarge
  upon this Hint; but if you think any thing can be made of it, I shall
  set about it with all the Pains and Application that so useful a Work
  deserves.<br>
<br>
  <i>I am ever</i>,<br>

  <i>Most Worthy <b>Sir</b> </i>, &amp;c.</blockquote>

I could not Smile at the Account that was Yesterday given me of a modest
young Gentleman, who being invited to an Entertainment, though he was
not used to drink, had not the Confidence to refuse his Glass in his
Turn, when on a sudden he grew so flustered that he took all the Talk of
the Table into his own Hands, abused every one of the Company, and flung
a Bottle at the Gentleman's Head who treated him. This has given me
Occasion to reflect upon the ill Effects of a vicious Modesty, and to
remember the Saying of <i>Brutus</i>, as it is quoted by <i>Plutarch</i>, that
<i>the Person has had but an ill Education, who has not been taught to
deny any thing</i>. This false kind of Modesty has, perhaps, betrayed both
Sexes into as many Vices as the most abandoned Impudence, and is the
more inexcusable to Reason, because it acts to gratify others rather
than it self, and is punished with a kind of Remorse, not only like
other vicious Habits when the Crime is over, but even at the very time
that it is committed.<br>
<br>
Nothing is more amiable than true Modesty, and nothing is more
contemptible than the false. The one guards Virtue, the other betrays
it. True Modesty is ashamed to do any thing that is repugnant to the
Rules of right Reason: False Modesty is ashamed to do any thing that is
opposite to the Humour of the Company. True Modesty avoids every thing
that is criminal, false Modesty every thing that is unfashionable. The
latter is only a general undetermined Instinct; the former is that
Instinct, limited and circumscribed by the Rules of Prudence and
Religion.<br>
<br>
We may conclude that Modesty to be false and vicious, which engages a
Man to do any thing that is ill or indiscreet, or which restrains him
from doing any thing that is of a contrary Nature. How many Men, in the
common Concerns of Life, lend Sums of Money which they are not able to
spare, are bound for Persons whom they have but little Friendship for,
give Recommendatory Characters of Men whom they are not acquainted with,
bestow Places on those whom they do not esteem, live in such a Manner as
they themselves do not approve, and all this meerly because they have
not the Confidence to resist Solicitation, Importunity or Example?<br>
<br>
Nor does this false Modesty expose us only to such Actions as are
indiscreet, <a name="fr4581">but</a> very often to such as are highly criminal. When
<i>Xenophanes</i><a href="#f4581"><sup>1</sup></a> was called timorous, because he would not venture his
Money in a Game at Dice: <i>I confess</i>, said he, <i>that I am exceeding
timorous, for I dare not do any ill thing</i>. On the contrary, a Man of
vicious Modesty complies with every thing, and is only fearful of doing
what may look singular in the Company where he is engaged. He falls in
with the Torrent, and lets himself go to every Action or Discourse,
however unjustifiable in it self, so it be in Vogue among the present
Party. This, tho' one of the most common, is one of the most ridiculous
Dispositions in Human Nature, that Men should not be ashamed of speaking
or acting in a dissolute or irrational Manner, but that one who is in
their Company should be ashamed of governing himself by the Principles
of Reason and Virtue.<br>
<br>
In the second place we are to consider false Modesty, as it restrains a
Man from doing what is good and laudable. My Reader's own Thoughts will
suggest to him many Instances and Examples under this Head. I shall only
dwell upon one Reflection, which I cannot make without a Secret Concern.
We have in <i>England</i> a particular Bashfulness in every thing that
regards Religion. A well-bred Man is obliged to conceal any Serious
Sentiment of this Nature, and very often to appear a greater Libertine
than he is, that he may keep himself in Countenance among the Men of
Mode. Our Excess of Modesty makes us shamefaced in all the Exercises of
Piety and Devotion. This Humour prevails upon us daily; insomuch, that
at many well-bred Tables, the Master of the House is so very Modest a
Man, that he has not the Confidence to say Grace at his own Table: A
Custom which is not only practised by all the Nations about us, but was
never omitted by the Heathens themselves. <i>English</i> Gentlemen who travel
into Roman-Catholick Countries, are not a little surprized to meet with
People of the best Quality kneeling in their Churches, and engaged in
their private Devotions, tho' it be not at the Hours of Publick Worship.
An Officer of the Army, or a Man of Wit and Pleasure in those Countries,
would be afraid of passing not only for an irreligious, but an ill-bred
Man, should he be seen to go to Bed, or sit down at Table, without
offering up his Devotions on such Occasions. The same Show of Religion
appears in all the Foreign Reformed Churches, and enters so much into
their Ordinary Conversation, that an <i>Englishman</i> is apt to term them
Hypocritical and Precise.<br>
<br>
This little Appearance of a Religious Deportment in our Nation, may
proceed in some measure from that Modesty which is natural to us, but
the great occasion of it is certainly this. Those Swarms of Sectaries
that overran the Nation in the time of the great Rebellion, carried
their Hypocrisie so high, that they had converted our whole Language
into a Jargon of Enthusiasm; insomuch that upon the Restoration Men
thought they could not recede too far from the Behaviour and Practice of
those Persons, who had made Religion a Cloak to so many Villanies. This
led them into the other Extream, every Appearance of Devotion was looked
upon as Puritannical, and falling into the Hands of the Ridiculers who
flourished in that Reign, and attacked every thing that was Serious, it
has ever since been out of Countenance among us. By this means we are
gradually fallen into that Vicious Modesty which has in some measure
worn out <a name="fr4582">from</a> among us the Appearance of Christianity in Ordinary Life
and Conversation, and which distinguishes us from all<span style="color: #663300;"> our Neighbours</span><a href="#f4582"><sup>2</sup></a>.<br>
<br>
Hypocrisie cannot indeed be too much detested, but at the same time is
to be preferred to open Impiety. They are both equally destructive to
the Person who is possessed with them; but in regard to others,
Hypocrisie is not so pernicious as bare-faced Irreligion. The due Mean
to be observed is to be sincerely Virtuous, and at the same time to let
the World see we are so. I do not know a more dreadful Menace in the
Holy Writings, than that which is pronounced against those who have this
perverted Modesty, to be ashamed before Men in a Particular of such
unspeakable Importance.<br>

<br>

Religion may be considered under two General Heads. The first
comprehends what we are to believe, the other what we are to practise.
By those things which we are to believe, I mean whatever is revealed to
us in the Holy Writings, and which we could not have obtained the
Knowledge of by the Light of Nature; by the things which we are to
practise, I mean all those Duties to which we are directed by Reason or
Natural Religion. The first of these I shall distinguish by the Name of
<i>Faith</i>, the Second by that of <i>Morality</i>.<br>
<br>
If we look into the more Serious Part of Mankind, we find many who lay
so great a Stress upon Faith, that they neglect Morality; and many who
build so much upon Morality, that they do not pay a due Regard to Faith.
The perfect Man should be defective in neither of these Particulars, as
will be very evident to those who consider the Benefits which arise from
each of them, and which I shall make the Subject of this Day's Paper.<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding this general Division of Christian Duty into Morality
and Faith, and that they have both their peculiar Excellencies, the
first has the Pre-eminence in several Respects.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><i>First:</i> Because the greatest Part of Morality (as I have stated the
  Notion of it,) is of a fixt Eternal Nature, and will endure when Faith
  shall fail, and be lost in Conviction.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Secondly:</i> Because a Person may be qualified to do greater
Good to Mankind, and become more beneficial to the World,
by Morality, without Faith, than by Faith without Morality.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Thirdly:</i> Because Morality gives a greater Perfection to human
  Nature, by quieting the Mind, moderating the Passions, and advancing
  the Happiness of every Man in his private Capacity.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Fourthly:</i> Because the Rule of Morality is much more certain than
  that of Faith, all the Civilized Nations of the World agreeing in the
  great Points of Morality, as much as they differ in those of Faith.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Fifthly:</i> Because Infidelity is not of so malignant a Nature as
  Immorality; or to put the same Reason in another Light, because it is
  generally owned, there may be Salvation for a virtuous Infidel,
  (particularly in the Case of Invincible Ignorance) but none for a
  vicious Believer.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Sixthly:</i> Because Faith seems to draw its principal, if not all its
  Excellency, from the Influence it has upon Morality; as we shall see
  more at large, if we consider wherein consists the Excellency of
  Faith, or the Belief of Revealed Religion; and this I think is,</li></ul>

<blockquote><ul>
<li><i>First:</i> In explaining and carrying to greater Heights, several
    Points of Morality.</li></ul>

<ul><li><i>Secondly:</i> In furnishing new and stronger Motives to enforce the
    Practice of Morality.</li></ul>

<ul><li><i>Thirdly:</i> In giving us more amiable Ideas of the Supreme Being,
    more endearing Notions of one another, and a truer State of our
    selves, both in regard to the Grandeur and Vileness of our Natures.</li></ul>

<ul><li><i>Fourthly:</i> By shewing us the Blackness and Deformity of Vice, which
    in the Christian System is so very great, that he who is possessed
    of all Perfection and the Sovereign Judge of it, is represented by
    several of our Divines as hating Sin to the same Degree that he
    loves the Sacred Person who was made the Propitiation of it.</li></ul>

<ul><li><i>Fifthly:</i> In being the ordinary and prescribed Method of making
    Morality effectual to Salvation.</li></ul></blockquote>

I have only touched on these several Heads, which every one who is
conversant in Discourses of this Nature will easily enlarge upon in his
own Thoughts, and draw Conclusions from them which may be useful to him
in the Conduct of his Life. One I am sure is so obvious, that he cannot
miss it, namely that a Man cannot be perfect in his Scheme of Morality,
who does not strengthen and support it with that of the Christian Faith.<br>
<br>
Besides this, I shall lay down two or three other Maxims which I think
we may deduce from what has been said.<br>
<br>
<ul><li><i>First:</i> That we should be particularly cautious of making any
  thing an Article of Faith, which does not contribute to the
  Confirmation or Improvement of Morality.</li></ul>

<ul><li><i>Secondly:</i> That no Article of Faith can be true and authentick, which
  weakens or subverts the practical part of Religion, or what I have
  hitherto called Morality.</li></ul>

<ul><li><i>Thirdly:</i> That the greatest Friend of Morality, or Natural Religion,
  cannot possibly apprehend any Danger from embracing Christianity, as
  it is preserved pure and uncorrupt in the Doctrines of our National
  Church.</li></ul><br>

There is likewise another Maxim which I think may be drawn from the
foregoing Considerations, which is this, that we should, in all dubious
Points, consider any ill Consequences that may arise from them,
supposing they should be Erroneous, before we give up our Assent to
them.<br>
<br>
For example, In that disputable Point of Prosecuting Men for Conscience
Sake, besides the imbittering their Minds with Hatred, Indignation, and
all the Vehemence of Resentment, and ensnaring them to profess what they
do not believe; we cut them off from the Pleasures and Advantages of
Society, afflict their Bodies, distress their Fortunes, hurt their
Reputations, ruin their Families, make their Lives painful, or put an
End to them. Sure when I see such dreadful Consequences rising from a
Principle, I would be as fully convinced of the Truth of it, as of a
Mathematical Demonstration, before I would venture to act upon it, or
make it a part of my Religion.<br>
<br>
In this Case the Injury done our Neighbour is plain and evident, the
Principle that puts us upon doing it, of a dubious and disputable
Nature. Morality seems highly violated by the one, and whether or no a
Zeal for what a Man thinks the true System of Faith may justifie it, is
very uncertain. I cannot but think, if our Religion produce Charity as
well as Zeal, it will not be for shewing it self by such cruel
Instances. <a name="fr4591">But</a>, to conclude with the Words of an excellent Author<a href="#f4591"><sup>1</sup></a>,
<i>We have just enough Religion to make us hate, but not enough to make us
love, one another.</i><br>

<br>

Our defects and Follies are too often unknown to us; nay, they are so
far from being known to us, that they pass for Demonstrations of our
Worth. This makes us easy in the midst of them, fond to shew them, fond
to improve in them, and to be esteemed for them. Then it is that a
thousand unaccountable Conceits, gay Inventions, and extravagant Actions
must afford us Pleasures, and display us to others in the Colours which
we ourselves take a Fancy to glory in: And indeed there is something so
amusing for the time in this State of Vanity and ill-grounded
Satisfaction, that even the wiser World has chosen an exalted Word to
describe its Enchantments, and called it the <i>Paradise of Fools</i>.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the latter part of this Reflection may seem a false Thought to
some, and bear another Turn than what I have given: but it is at present
none of my Business to look after it, who am going to confess that I
have been lately amongst them in a Vision.<br>
<br>
Methought I was transported to a Hill, green, flowery, and of an easie
Ascent. Upon the broad Top of it resided squinteyed <i>Error</i>, and popular
<i>Opinion</i> with many Heads; two that dealt in Sorcery, and were famous
for bewitching People with the Love of themselves. To these repaired a
Multitude from every Side, by two different Paths which lead towards
each of them. Some who had the most assuming Air, went directly of
themselves to <i>Errour</i>, without expecting a Conductor; others of a
softer Nature went first to popular <i>Opinion</i>, from whence as she
influenced and engaged them with their own Praises, she delivered them
over to his Government.<br>
<br>
When we had ascended to an open Part of the Summit where <i>Opinion</i>
abode, we found her entertaining several who had arrived before us. Her
Voice was pleasing; she breathed Odours as she spoke: She seemed to have
a Tongue for every one; every one thought he heard of something that was
valuable in himself, and expected a Paradise, which she promised as the
Reward of his Merit. Thus were we drawn to follow her, till she should
bring us where it was to be bestowed: And it was observable, that all
the Way we went, the Company was either praising themselves for their
Qualifications, or one another for those Qualifications which they took
to be conspicuous in their own Characters, or dispraising others for
wanting theirs, or vying in the Degrees of them.<br>
<br>
At last we approached a Bower, at the Entrance of which <i>Errour</i> was
seated. The Trees were thick-woven, and the Place where he sat artfully
contrived to darken him a little. He was disguised in a whitish Robe,
which he had put on, that he might appear to us with a nearer
Resemblance to <i>Truth:</i> And as she has a Light whereby she manifests the
Beauties of Nature to the Eyes of her Adorers, so he had provided
himself with a magical Wand, that he might do something in Imitation of
it, and please with Delusions. This he lifted solemnly, and muttering to
himself, bid the Glories which he kept under Enchantment to appear
before us. Immediately we cast our Eyes on that part of the Sky to which
he pointed, and observed a thin blue Prospect, which cleared as
Mountains in a Summer Morning when the Mists go off, and the Palace of
<i>Vanity</i> appeared to Sight.<br>
<br>
The Foundation hardly seemed a Foundation, but a Set of curling Clouds,
which it stood upon by magical Contrivance. The Way by which we ascended
was painted like a Rainbow; and as we went the Breeze that played about
us bewitched the Senses. The Walls were gilded all for Show; the lowest
Set of Pillars were of the slight fine <i>Corinthian</i> Order, and the Top
of the Building being rounded, bore so far the Resemblance of a Bubble.<br>
<br>
At the Gate the Travellers neither met with a Porter, nor waited till
one should appear; every one thought his Merits a sufficient Passport,
and pressed forward. In the Hall we met with several Phantoms, that
rov'd amongst us, and rang'd the Company according to their Sentiments.
There was decreasing <i>Honour</i>, that had nothing to shew in but an old
Coat of his Ancestors Atchievements: There was <i>Ostentation</i>, that made
himself his own constant Subject, and <i>Gallantry</i> strutting upon his
Tiptoes. At the upper End of the Hall stood a Throne, whose Canopy
glitter'd with all the Riches that Gayety could contrive to lavish on
it; and between the gilded Arms sat <i>Vanity</i>, deck'd in the Peacock's
Feathers, and acknowledged for another <i>Venus</i> by her Votaries. The Boy
who stood beside her for a <i>Cupid</i>, and who made the World to bow before
her, was called <i>Self-Conceit</i>. His Eyes had every now and then a Cast
inwards to the Neglect of all Objects about him; and the Arms which he
made use of for Conquest, were borrowed from those against whom he had a
Design. The Arrow which he shot at the Soldier, was fledged from his own
Plume of Feathers; the Dart he directed against the Man of Wit, was
winged from the Quills he writ with; and that which he sent against
those who presumed upon their Riches, was headed with Gold out of their
Treasuries: He made Nets for Statesmen from their own Contrivances; he
took Fire from the Eyes of Ladies, with which he melted their Hearts;
and Lightning from the Tongues of the Eloquent, to enflame them with
their own Glories. At the Foot of the Throne sat three false Graces.
<i>Flattery</i> with a Shell of Paint, <i>Affectation</i> with a Mirrour to
practise at, and <i>Fashion</i> ever changing the Posture of her Cloaths.
These applied themselves to secure the Conquests which <i>Self-Conceit</i>
had gotten, and had each of them their particular Polities. <i>Flattery</i>
gave new Colours and Complections to all Things. <i>Affectation</i> new Airs
and Appearances, which, as she said, were not vulgar, and <i>Fashion</i> both
concealed some home Defects, and added some foreign external Beauties<br>
<br>
As I was reflecting upon what I saw, I heard a Voice in the Crowd,
bemoaning the Condition of Mankind, which is thus managed by the Breath
of <i>Opinion</i>, deluded by <i>Errour</i>, fired by <i>Self-Conceit</i>, and given up
to be trained in all the Courses of <i>Vanity</i>, till <i>Scorn</i> or <i>Poverty</i>
come upon us. These Expressions were no sooner handed about, but I
immediately saw a general  Disorder, till at last there was a Parting in
one Place, and a grave old Man, decent and resolute, was led forward to
be punished for the Words he had uttered. He appeared inclined to have
spoken in his own Defence, but I could not observe that any one was
willing to hear him. <i>Vanity</i> cast a scornful Smile at him;
<i>Self-Conceit</i> was angry; <i>Flattery</i>, who knew him for <i>Plain-dealing</i>,
put on a Vizard, and turned away; <i>Affectation</i> tossed her Fan, made
Mouths, and called him <i>Envy</i> or <i>Slander</i>; and <i>Fashion</i> would have it,
that at least he must be <i>Ill-Manners</i>. Thus slighted and despised by
all, he was driven out for abusing People of Merit and Figure; and I
heard it firmly resolved, that he should be used no better wherever they
met with him hereafter.<br>
<br>
I had already seen the Meaning of most part of that Warning which he had
given, and was considering how the latter Words should be fulfilled,
when a mighty Noise was heard without, and the Door was blackned by a
numerous Train of Harpies crowding in upon us. <i>Folly</i> and <i>Broken
Credit</i> were seen in the House before they entered. <i>Trouble, Shame,
Infamy, Scorn</i> and <i>Poverty</i> brought up the Rear. <i>Vanity</i>, with her
<i>Cupid</i> and <i>Graces</i>, disappeared; her Subjects ran into Holes and
Corners; but many of them were found and carried off (as I was told by
one who stood near me) either to Prisons or Cellars, Solitude, or little
Company, the meaner Arts or the viler Crafts of Life. But these, added
he with a disdainful Air, are such who would fondly live here, when
their Merits neither matched the Lustre of the Place, nor their Riches
its Expences. We have seen such Scenes as these before now; the Glory
you saw will all return when the Hurry is over. I thanked him for his
Information, and believing him so incorrigible as that he would stay
till it was his Turn to be taken, I made off to the Door, and overtook
some few, who, though they would not hearken to <i>Plain-dealing</i>, were
now terrified to good purpose by the Example of others: But when they
had touched the Threshold, it was a strange Shock to them to find that
the Delusion of <i>Errour</i> was gone, and they plainly discerned the
Building to hang a little up in the Air without any real Foundation. At
first we saw nothing but a desperate Leap remained for us, and I a
thousand times blamed my unmeaning Curiosity that had brought me into so
much Danger. But as they began to sink lower in their own Minds,
methought the Palace sunk along with us, till they were arrived at the
due Point of <i>Esteem</i> which they ought to have for themselves; then the
Part of the Building in which they stood touched the Earth, and we
departing out, it retired from our Eyes. Now, whether they who stayed in
the Palace were sensible of this Descent, I cannot tell; it was then my
Opinion that they were not. However it be, my Dream broke up at it, and
has given me Occasion all my Life to reflect upon the fatal Consequences
of following the Suggestions of <i>Vanity</i>.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote><i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'I write to you to de<b>Sir</b> e, that you would again touch upon a certain
  Enormity, which is chiefly in Use among the Politer and better-bred
  Part of Mankind; I mean the Ceremonies, Bows, Courtsies, Whisperings,
  Smiles, Winks, Nods, with other familiar Arts of Salutation, which
  take up in our Churches so much Time, that might be better employed,
  and which seem so utterly inconsistent with the Duty and true Intent
  of our entering into those Religious Assemblies. The Resemblance which
  this bears to our indeed proper Behaviour in Theatres, may be some
  Instance of its Incongruity in the above-mentioned Places. In <i>Roman</i>
  Catholick Churches and Chappels abroad, I my self have observed, more
  than once, Persons of the first Quality, of the nearest Relation, and
  intimatest Acquaintance passing by one another unknowing as it were
  and unknown, and with so little Notices of each other, that it looked
  like having their Minds more suitably and more solemnly engaged; at
  least it was an Acknowledgment that they ought to have been so. I have
  been told the same even of the <i>Mahometans</i>, with relation to the
  Propriety of their Demeanour in the Conventions of their erroneous
  Worship: And I cannot but think either of them sufficient and laudable
  Patterns for our Imitation in this Particular.<br>
<br>
  'I cannot help upon this Occasion remarking on the excellent Memories
  of those Devotionists, who upon returning from Church shall give a
  particular Account how two or three hundred People were dressed; a
  Thing, by reason of its Variety, so difficult to be digested and fixed
  in the Head, that 'tis a Miracle to me how two poor Hours of
  Divine Service can be Time sufficient for so elaborate an undertaking,
  the Duty of the Place too being jointly and, no doubt, oft
  pathetically performed along with it. Where it is <a name="fr4602">said</a> in Sacred Wit,
  that <i>the Woman ought to have a Covering on her Head, because of the
  Angels</i><a href="#f4602"><sup>2</sup></a> that last Word is by some thought to be metaphorically
  used, and to signify young Men. Allowing this Interpretation to be
  right, the Text may not appear to be wholly foreign to our present
  Purpose.<br>
<br>
  'When you are in a Disposition proper for writing on such a Subject, I
  earnestly recommend this to you, and am,<br>
<br>
  <i><b>Sir</b> ,<br>
<br>
  Your very humble Servant.</i>

<a name="f4601"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote 1:</span></a> &nbsp; Thomas Parnell, the writer of this allegory, was the son of
a commonwealthsman, who at the Restoration ceased to live on his
hereditary lands at Congleton, in Cheshire, and bought an estate in
Ireland. Born in 1679, at Dublin, where he became M.A. of Trinity
College, in 1700 he was ordained after taking his degree, and in 1705
became Archdeacon of Clogher. At the same time he took a wife, who died
in 1711. Parnell had been an associate of the chief Whig writers, had
taste as a poet, and found pleasure in writing for the papers of the
time. When the Whigs went out of power in Queen Anne's reign, Parnell
connected himself with the Tories. On the warm recommendation of Swift,
he obtained a prebend in 1713, and in May, 1716, a vicarage in the
diocese of Dublin, worth &pound;400 a year. He died in July, 1717, aged 38.
Inheriting his father's estates in Cheshire and Ireland, Pamell was not
in need. Wanting vigour and passion, he was neither formidable nor
bitter as a political opponent, and in 1712 his old friends, Steele and
Addison, were glad of a paper from him; though, with Swift, he had gone
over to the other side in politics.<br>

For want of Time to substitute something else in the Room of them, I am
at present obliged to publish Compliments above my Desert in the
following Letters. It is no small Satisfaction, to have given Occasion
to ingenious Men to employ their Thoughts upon sacred Subjects, from the
Approbation of such Pieces of Poetry as they have seen in my
<i>Saturday's</i> Papers. I shall never publish Verse on that Day but what is
written by the same Hand; yet shall I not accompany those Writings with
<i>Eulogiums</i>, but leave them to speak for themselves.<br>

<blockquote><i>For the</i> SPECTATOR.<br>
<br>
  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'You very much promote the Interests of Virtue, while you reform the
  Taste of a Prophane Age, and persuade us to be entertained with Divine
  Poems, while we are distinguished by so many thousand Humours, and
  split into so many different Sects and Parties; yet Persons of every
  Party, Sect, and Humour are fond of conforming their Taste to yours.
  You can transfuse your own Relish of a Poem into all your Readers,
  according to their Capacity to receive; and when you recommend the
  pious Passion that reigns in the Verse, we seem to feel the Devotion,
  and grow proud and pleas'd inwardly, that we have Souls capable of
  relishing what the <b>Spectator</b> approves.<br>
<br>
  'Upon reading the Hymns that you have published in some late Papers, I
  had a Mind to try Yesterday whether I could write one. The 114th
  <i>Psalm</i> appears to me an admirable Ode, and I began to turn it into
  our Language. As I was describing the Journey of <i>Israel</i> from
  <i>Egypt</i>, and added the Divine Presence amongst them, I perceived a
  Beauty in the <i>Psalm</i> which was entirely new to me, and which I was
  going to lose; and that is, that the Poet utterly conceals the
  Presence of God in the Beginning of it, and rather lets a Possessive
  Pronoun go without a Substantive, than he will so much as mention any
  thing of Divinity there. <i>Judah was his Sanctuary, and</i> Israel <i>his
  Dominion or Kingdom</i>. The Reason now seems evident, and this Conduct
  necessary: For if God had appeared before, there could be no wonder
  why the Mountains should leap and the Sea retire; therefore that this
  Convulsion of Nature may be brought in with due Surprise, his Name is
  not mentioned till afterward, and then with a very agreeable Turn of
  Thought God is introduced at once in all his Majesty. This is what I
  have attempted to imitate in a Translation without Paraphrase, and to
  preserve what I could of the Spirit of the sacred Author.<br>

  There are those who take the Advantage of your putting an Half-penny
  Value upon your self above the rest of our daily Writers, to defame
  you in publick Conversation, and strive to make you unpopular upon the
  Account of this said Half-penny. But if I were you, I would insist
  upon that small Acknowledgment for the superior Merit of yours, as
  being a Work of Invention. Give me Leave therefore to do you Justice,
  and say in your Behalf what you cannot your self, which is, That your
  Writings have made Learning a more necessary Part of good Breeding
  than it was before you appeared: That Modesty is become fashionable,
  and Impudence stands in need of some Wit, since you have put them both
  in their proper Lights. Prophaneness, Lewdness, and Debauchery are not
  now Qualifications, and a Man may be a very fine Gentleman, tho' he is
  neither a Keeper nor an Infidel.<br>
<br>
  I would have you tell the Town the Story of the <i>Sybills</i>, if they
  deny giving you Two-Pence. Let them know, that those sacred Papers
  were valued at the same Rate after two Thirds of them were destroyed,
  as when there was the whole Set. There are so many of us who will give
  you your own Price, that you may acquaint your Non-Conformist Readers,
  That they shall not have it, except they come in within such a Day,
  under Three-pence. I don't know, but you might bring in the <i>Date
  Obolum Belisario</i> with a good Grace. The Witlings come in Clusters to
  two or three Coffee-houses which have left you off, and I hope you
  will make us, who fine to your Wit, merry with their Characters who
  stand out against it.<br>

<a name="f4611"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote 1:</span></a> &nbsp; This letter and the version of the <i>114th Psalm</i> are by Dr
Isaac Watts, who was at this time 38 years old, broken down by an attack
of illness, and taking rest and change with his friend <b>Sir</b>  Thomas Abney,
at Theobalds. Isaac Watts, the son of a Nonconformist schoolmaster at
Southampton, had injured his health by excessive study. After acting for
a time as tutor to the son of <b>Sir</b>  John Hartupp, he preached his first
sermon in 1698, and three years later became pastor of the Nonconformist
congregation in Mark Lane. By this office he abided, and with <b>Sir</b>  Thomas
Abney also he abided; his visit to Theobalds, in 1712, being, on all
sides, so agreeable that he stayed there for the remaining 36 years of
his life. There he wrote his <i>Divine and Moral Songs </i>for children, his
<i>Hymns</i>, and his metrical version of the <i>Psalms</i>. But his <i>Hor&aelig; Lyric&aelig;</i>,
published in 1709, had already attracted much attention when he
contributed this Psalm to the <i>Spectator</i>. In the Preface to that
collection of <i>Poems chiefly of the Lyric kind, in Three Books, sacred,
I. to Devotion and Piety. II. To Virtue, Honour, and Friendship. III. To
the Memory of the Dead,</i> he had argued that Poesy, whose original is
divine, had been desecrated to the vilest purpose, enticed unthinking
youth to sin, and fallen into discredit among some weaker Christians.
'They submit indeed to use it in divine psalmody, but they love the
driest translation of the Psalms best.' Watts bade them look into their
Bibles and observe the boldness of its poetic imagery, rejected the
dictum of Boileau, that

 <blockquote><i> De la foy d'un Chr&eacute;tien les myst&egrave;res terribles<br>
  D'ornemens egay&eacute;z ne sont point susceptibles;</i></blockquote>

and pointed to the way he had chosen for himself as a Biblical rhymer.
Poesy, he reminds his readers, is, as his title indicates, not the business of
his life. 

 <blockquote> 'And if I seized those hours of leisure, wherein my soul was in a more
  sprightly frame, to entertain them or myself with a divine or moral
  song, I hope I shall find an easy pardon.'</blockquote>

Watts died in 1748, aged 74.<br>

People are not aware of the very great Force which Pleasantry in Company
has upon all those with whom a Man of that Talent converses. His Faults
are generally overlooked by all his Acquaintance, and a certain
Carelessness that constantly attends all his Actions, carries him on
with greater Success, than Diligence and Assiduity does others who have
no Share of this Endowment. <i>Dacinthus</i> breaks his Word upon all
Occasions both trivial and important; and when he is sufficiently railed
at for that abominable Quality, they who talk of him end with, <i>After
all he is a very pleasant Fellow. Dacinthus</i> is an ill-natured Husband,
and yet the very Women end their Freedom of Discourse upon this Subject,
<i>But after all he is very pleasant Company.</i> <i>Dacinthus</i> is neither in
point of Honour, Civility, good Breeding, or good Nature
unexceptionable, and yet all is answered, <i>For he is a very pleasant
Fellow.</i> When this Quality is conspicuous in a Man who has, to accompany
it, manly and virtuous Sentiments, there cannot certainly be any thing
which can give so pleasing Gratification as the Gaiety of such a Person;
but when it is alone, and serves only to gild a Crowd of ill Qualities,
there is no Man so much to be avoided as your pleasant Fellow. A very
pleasant Fellow shall turn your good Name to a Jest, make your Character
contemptible, debauch your Wife or Daughter, and yet be received by the
rest of the World with Welcome where-ever he appears. It is very
ordinary with those of this Character to be attentive only to their own
Satisfactions, and have very little Bowels for the Concerns or Sorrows
of other Men; nay, they are capable of purchasing their own Pleasures at
the Expence of giving Pain to others. But they who do not consider this
sort of Men thus carefully, are irresistibly exposed to his
Insinuations. The Author of the following Letter carries the Matter so
high, as to intimate that the Liberties of <i>England</i> have been at the
Mercy of a Prince merely as he was of this pleasant Character.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote><i>Mr</i>. Spectator,<br>
<br>
  'There is no one Passion which all Mankind so naturally give into as
  Pride, nor any other Passion which appears in such different
  Disguises: It is to be found in all Habits and all Complexions. Is it
  not a Question, whether it does more Harm or Good in the World? And if
  there be not such a Thing as what we may call a virtuous and laudable
  Pride?<br>
<br>
  'It is this Passion alone, when misapplyed, that lays us so open to
  Flatterers; and he who can agreeably condescend to sooth our Humour or
  Temper, finds always an open Avenue to our Soul; especially if the
  Flatterer happen to be our Superior.<br>
<br>
  'One might give many Instances of this in a late <i>English</i> Monarch,
  under the Title of, <i>The Gayeties of King</i> Charles II. This Prince was
  by Nature extreamly familiar, of very easie Access, and much delighted
  to see and be seen; and this happy Temper, which in the highest Degree
  gratified his Peoples Vanity, did him more Service with his loving
  Subjects than all his other Virtues, tho' it must be confessed he had
  many. He delighted, tho' a mighty King, to give and take a Jest, as
  they say; and a Prince of this fortunate Disposition, who were
  inclined to make an ill Use of his Power, may have any thing of his
  People, be it never so much to their Prejudice. But this good King
  made generally a very innocent Use, as to the Publick, of this
  ensnaring Temper; for, 'tis well known, he pursued Pleasure more than
  Ambition: He seemed to glory in being the first Man at Cock-matches,
  Horse-races, Balls, and Plays; he appeared highly delighted on those
  Occasions, and never failed to warm and gladden the Heart of every
  Spectator. He more than once dined with his good Citizens of <i>London</i>
  on their Lord-Mayor's Day, and did so the Year that <b>Sir</b>  <i>Robert Viner</i>
  was Mayor. <b>Sir</b>  <i>Robert</i> was a very loyal Man, and, if you will allow
  the Expression, very fond of his Sovereign; but what with the Joy he
  felt at Heart for the Honour done him by his Prince, and thro' the
  Warmth he was in with continual toasting Healths to the Royal Family,
  his Lordship grew a little fond of his Majesty, and entered into a
  Familiarity not altogether so graceful in so publick a Place. The King
  understood very well how to extricate himself on all kinds of
  Difficulties, and with an Hint to the Company to avoid Ceremony, stole
  off and made towards his Coach, which stood ready for him in
  <i>Guild-Hall</i> Yard: But the Mayor liked his Company so well, and was
  grown so intimate, that he pursued him hastily, and catching him fast
  by the Hand, cryed out with a vehement Oath and Accent, <i><b>Sir</b> , You
  shall stay and take t'other Bottle</i>. The airy Monarch looked kindly at
  him over his Shoulder, and with a Smile and graceful Air, (for I saw
  him at the Time, and do now) <a name="fr4621">repeated</a> this Line of the old Song;

<blockquote>He that's drunk is as great as a King.</blockquote>

  and immediately <span style="color: #663300;">turned</span><a href="#f4621"><sup>1</sup></a> back and complied with his Landlord.<br>
<br>
  I give you this Story, Mr. SPECTATOR, because, as I said, I saw the
  Passage; and I assure you it's very true, and yet no common one; and
  when I tell you the Sequel, you will say I have yet a better Reason
  for't. <a name="fr4622">This</a> very Mayor afterwards erected a Statue of his merry
  Monarch in <i>Stocks-Market</i><a href="#f4622"><sup>2</sup></a>, and did the Crown many and great
  Services; and it was owing to this Humour of the King, that his Family
  had so great a Fortune shut up in the Exchequer of their pleasant
  Sovereign. The many good-natured Condescensions of this Prince are
  vulgarly known: and <a name="fr4623">it</a> is excellently said of him by a great Hand
  which writ his Character, <i>That he was not a King a Quarter of an Hour
  together in his whole Reign</i><a href="#f4623"><sup>3</sup></a>. He would receive Visits even from
  Fools and half Mad-men, and at Times I have met with People who have
  Boxed, fought at Back-sword, and taken Poison before King <i>Charles</i>
  II. In a Word, he was so pleasant a Man, that no one could be
  sorrowful under his Government. This made him capable of baffling,
  with the greatest Ease imaginable, all Suggestions of Jealousie, and
  the People could not entertain Notions of any thing terrible in him,
  whom they saw every way agreeable. This Scrap of the familiar Part of
  that Prince's History I thought fit to send you, in compliance to the
  Request you lately made to your Correspondents.<br>

  Your most humble Servant.</i>

It was a statue of John Sobieski trampling on a Turk, which had been
left on the sculptor's hands, but his worship the Mayor caused a few
alterations to be made for the conversion of Sobieski into Charles, and
the Turk (still with a turban on his head) into Oliver Cromwell. After

I was lately entertaining my self with comparing <i>Homer's</i> Ballance, in
which <i>Jupiter</i> is represented as weighing the Fates of <i>Hector</i> and
<i>Achilles</i>, with a Passage of <i>Virgil</i>, wherein that Deity is introduced
as weighing the Fates of <i>Turnus</i> and <i>&AElig;neas</i>. I then considered how the
same way of thinking prevailed in the Eastern Parts of the World, as in
those noble Passages of Scripture, wherein we are told, that the great
King of <i>Babylon</i> the Day before his Death, had been weighed in the
Ballance, and been found wanting. In other Places of the Holy Writings,
the Almighty is described as weighing the Mountains in Scales, making
the Weight for the Winds, knowing the Ballancings of the Clouds, and in
others, as weighing the Actions of Men, and laying their Calamities
together in a Ballance. <i>Milton</i>, as I <a name="fr4631">have</a> observed in a former Paper,
had an Eye to several of these foregoing Instances, in that beautiful
Description<a href="#f4631"><sup>1</sup></a> wherein he represents the Arch-Angel and the Evil Spirit
as addressing themselves for the Combat, but parted by the Ballance
which appeared in the Heavens and weighed the Consequences of such a
Battel.

<blockquote><i>Th' Eternal to prevent such horrid fray<br>
Hung forth in Heav'n his golden Scales, yet seen<br>
Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion Sign,<br>
Wherein all things created first he weigh'd,<br>
The pendulous round Earth with ballanc'd Air<br>
In counterpoise, now ponders all events,<br>
Battels and Realms; in these he puts two weights<br>
The sequel each of parting and of fight,<br>
The latter quick up flew, and kickt the Beam:<br>
Which</i> Gabriel <i>spying, thus bespake the Fiend.</i><br><br>

Satan, <i>I know thy Strength, and thou know'st mine,<br>
Neither our own, but giv'n; what folly then<br>
To boast what Arms can do, since thine no more<br>
Than Heav'n permits; nor mine, though doubled now<br>
To trample thee as mire: For proof look up,<br>
And read thy Lot in yon celestial Sign<br>
  Where thou art weigh'd, and shewn how light, how weak,<br>
  If thou resist. The Fiend look'd up, and knew<br>
  His mounted Scale aloft; nor more, but fled<br>
  Murm'ring, and with him fled the Shades of Night.</i></blockquote>

These several amusing Thoughts having taken Possession of my Mind some
time before I went to sleep, and mingling themselves with my ordinary
Ideas, raised in my Imagination a very odd kind of Vision. I was,
methought, replaced in my Study, and seated in my Elbow Chair, where I
had indulged the foregoing Speculations, with my Lamp burning by me, as
usual. Whilst I was here meditating on several Subjects of Morality, and
considering the Nature of many Virtues and Vices, as Materials for those
Discourses with which I daily entertain the Publick; I saw, methought, a
Pair of Golden Scales hanging by a Chain of the same Metal over the
Table that stood before me; when on a sudden, there were great Heaps of
Weights thrown down on each side of them. I found upon examining these
Weights, they shewed the Value of every thing that is in Esteem among
Men. I made an Essay of them, by putting the Weight of Wisdom in one
Scale, and that of Riches in another, upon which the latter, to shew its
comparative Lightness, immediately <i>flew up and kickt the Beam</i>.<br>
<br>
But, before I proceed, I must inform my Reader, that these Weights did
not exert their Natural Gravity, 'till they were laid in the Golden
Ballance, insomuch that I could not guess which was light or heavy,
whilst I held them in my Hand. This I found by several Instances; for
upon my laying a Weight in one of the Scales, which was inscribed by the
Word <i>Eternity</i>; tho' I threw in that of Time, Prosperity, Affliction,
Wealth, Poverty, Interest, Success, with many other Weights, which in my
Hand seemed very ponderous, they were not able to stir the opposite
Ballance, nor could they have prevailed, though assisted with the Weight
of the Sun, the Stars, and the Earth.<br>
<br>
Upon emptying the Scales, I laid several Titles and Honours, with Pomps,
Triumphs, and many Weights of the like Nature, in one of them, and
seeing a little glittering Weight lie by me, I threw it accidentally
into the other Scale, when, to my great Surprize, it proved so exact a
Counterpoise, that it kept the Ballance in an Equilibrium. This little
glittering Weight was inscribed upon the Edges of it with the Word
<i>Vanity</i>. I found there were several other Weights which were equally
Heavy, and exact Counterpoises to one another; a few of them I tried, as
Avarice and Poverty, Riches and Content, with some others.<br>
<br>
There were likewise several Weights that were of the same Figure, and
seemed to Correspond with each other, but were entirely different when
thrown into the Scales; as Religion and Hypocrisie, Pedantry and
Learning, Wit and Vivacity, Superstition and Devotion, Gravity and
Wisdom, with many others.<br>
<br>
I observed one particular Weight lettered on both sides, and upon
applying my self to the Reading of it, I found on one side written, <i>In
the Dialect of Men</i>, and underneath it, <i><b>Calamities</b></i>; on the other side
was written, <i>In the Language of the Gods</i>, and underneath, <b><i>Blessings</i></b>.
I found the Intrinsick value of this Weight to be much greater than I
imagined, for it overpowered Health, Wealth, Good Fortune, and many
other Weights, which were much more ponderous in my Hand than the other.<br>
<br>
There is a Saying among the <i>Scotch</i>, that an Ounce of Mother is worth a
Pound of Clergy; I was sensible of the Truth of this Saying, when I saw
the Difference between the Weight of Natural Parts, and that of
Learning. The Observation which I made upon these two Weights opened to
me a new Field of Discoveries, for notwithstanding the Weight of Natural
Parts was much heavier than that of Learning; I observed that it weighed
an hundred times heavier than it did before, when I put Learning into
the same Scale with it. I made the same Observation upon Faith and
Morality, for notwithstanding the latter out-weighed the former
separately, it received a thousand times more additional Weight from its
Conjunction with the former, than what it had by it self. This odd
Ph&aelig;nomenon shewed it self, in other Particulars, as in Wit and Judgment,
Philosophy and Religion, Justice and Humanity, Zeal and Charity, Depth
of Sense and Perspicuity of Style, with innumerable other Particulars
too long to be mentioned in this Paper.<br>
<br>
As a Dream seldom fails of dashing Seriousness with Impertinence, Mirth
with Gravity, methought I made several other Experiments of a more
ludicrous Nature, by one of which I found that an <i>English</i> Octavo was
very often heavier than a <i>French</i> Folio; and by another, that an old
<i>Greek</i> or <i>Latin</i> Author weighed down a whole Library of Moderns.
Seeing one of my <i><b>Spectators</b></i> lying by me, I laid it into one of the
Scales, and flung a two-penny Piece into the other. The Reader will not
enquire into the Event, if he remembers the first Tryal which I have
recorded in this Paper. I afterwards threw both the Sexes into the
Ballance; but as it is not for my Interest to disoblige either of them,
I shall de<b>Sir</b> e to be excused from telling the Result of this Experiment.
Having an Opportunity of this Nature in my Hands, I could not forbear
throwing into one Scale the Principles of a Tory, and into the other
those of a Whig; but as I have all along declared this to be a Neutral
Paper, I shall likewise de<b>Sir</b> e to be silent under this Head also, though
upon examining one of the Weights, I saw the Word <i>TEKEL</i> Engraven on it
in Capital Letters.<br>
<br>
I made many other Experiments, and though I have not Room for them all
in this Day's Speculation, I may perhaps reserve them for another. I
shall only add, that upon my awaking I was sorry to find my Golden
Scales vanished, but resolved for the future to learn this Lesson from
them, not to despise or value any Things for their Appearances, but to
regulate my Esteem and Passions towards them according to their real and
intrinsick Value.<br>

I am wonderfully pleased when I meet with any Passage in an old <i>Greek</i>
or <i>Latin</i> Author, that is not blown upon, and which I have never met
with in a Quotation. Of this kind is a beautiful Saying in <i>Theognis</i>;
<i>Vice is covered by Wealth, and Virtue by Poverty</i>; or to give it in the
Verbal Translation, <i>Among Men there are some who have their Vices
concealed by Wealth, and others who have their Virtues concealed by
Poverty.</i> Every Man's Observation will supply him with Instances of Rich
Men, who have several Faults and Defects that are overlooked, if not
entirely hidden, by means of their Riches; and, I think, we cannot find
a more Natural Description of a Poor Man, whose Merits are lost in his
Poverty, than that in the Words of the Wise Man. <i>There was a little
City, and a few Men within it; and there came a great King against it,
and besieged it, and built great Bulwarks against it: Now there was
found in it a poor Wise Man, and he, by his Wisdom, delivered the City;
yet no Man remembered that same poor Man. <a name="fr4641">Then</a> said I, Wisdom is better
than Strength; nevertheless, the poor Man's Wisdom is despised, and his
Words are not heard.</i><a href="#f4641"><sup>1</sup></a><br>
<br>
The middle Condition seems to be the most advantageously situated for
the gaining of Wisdom. Poverty turns our Thoughts too much upon the
supplying of our Wants, and Riches upon enjoying our Superfluities; and,
as <i>Cowley</i> has said in another Case, <i>It is hard for a Man to keep a
steady Eye upon Truth, who is always in a Battel or a Triumph.</i><br>
<br>
If we regard Poverty and Wealth, as they are apt to produce Virtues or
Vices in the Mind of Man, one may observe, that there is a Set of each
of these growing out of Poverty, quite different from that which rises
out of Wealth. Humility and Patience, Industry and Temperance, are very
often the good Qualities of a poor Man. Humanity and Good-nature,
Magnanimity, and a Sense of Honour, are as often the Qualifications of
the Rich. On the contrary, Poverty is apt to betray a Man into Envy,
Riches into Arrogance. Poverty is too often attended with Fraud, vicious
Compliance, Repining, Murmur and Discontent; Riches expose a Man to
Pride and Luxury, a foolish Elation of Heart, and too great a Fondness
for the present World. In short, the middle Condition is most eligible
to the Man who would improve himself in Virtue; as I have before shewn,
it is the most advantageous for the gaining of Knowledge. It was upon
this Consideration that <i>Agur</i> founded his Prayer, which for the Wisdom
of it is recorded in <a name="fr4642">Holy</a> Writ. <i>Two things have I required of thee,
deny me them not before I die. Remove far from me Vanity and Lies; give
me neither Poverty, nor Riches; feed me with Food convenient for me.
Lest I be full and deny thee, and say, who is the Lord? or lest I be
poor and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.</i><a href="#f4642"><sup>2</sup></a><br>
<br>
I shall <a name="fr4643">fill</a> the remaining Part of my Paper with a very pretty Allegory,
which is wrought into a Play<a href="#f4643"><sup>3</sup></a> by <i>Aristophanes</i> the <i>Greek</i> Comedian.
It seems originally designed as a Satyr upon the Rich, though, in some
Parts of it, 'tis like the foregoing Discourse, a kind of Comparison
between Wealth and Poverty.<br>
<br>
<i>Chremylus</i>, who was an old and a good Man, and withal exceeding Poor,
being de<b>Sir</b> ous to leave some Riches to his Son, consults the Oracle of
<i>Apollo</i> upon the Subject. The Oracle bids him follow the first Man he
should see upon his going out of the Temple. The Person he chanced to
see was to Appearance an old sordid blind Man, but upon his following
him from Place to Place, he at last found by his own Confession, that he
was <i>Plutus</i> the God of Riches, and that he was just come out of the
House of a Miser. <i>Plutus</i> further told him, that when he was a Boy, he
used to declare, that as soon as he came to Age he would distribute
Wealth to none but virtuous and just Men; upon which <i>Jupiter</i>,
considering the pernicious Consequences of such a Resolution, took his
Sight away from him, and left him to strole about the World in the Blind
Condition wherein <i>Chremylus</i> beheld him. With much ado <i>Chremylus</i>
prevailed upon him to go to his House, where he met an old Woman in a
tattered Raiment, who had been his Guest for many Years, and whose Name
was <i>Poverty</i>. The old Woman refusing to turn out so easily as he would
have her, he threatned to banish her not only from his own House, but
out of all <i>Greece</i>, if she made any more Words upon the Matter.
<i>Poverty</i> on this Occasion pleads her Cause very notably, and represents
to her old Landlord, that should she be driven out of the Country, all
their Trades, Arts and Sciences would be driven out with her; and that
if every one was Rich, they would never be supplied with those Pomps,
Ornaments and Conveniences of Life which made Riches de<b>Sir</b> able. She
likewise represented to him the several Advantages which she bestowed
upon her Votaries, in regard to their Shape, their Health, and their
Activity, by preserving them from Gouts, Dropsies, Unweildiness, and
Intemperance. But whatever she had to say for her self, she was at last
forced to troop off. <i>Chremylus</i> immediately considered how he might
restore <i>Plutus</i> to his Sight; and in order to it conveyed him to the
Temple of <i>&AElig;sculapius</i>, who was famous for Cures and Miracles of this
Nature. By this means the Deity <a name="fr4644">recovered</a> his Eyes, and begun to make a
right use of them, by enriching every one that <span style="color: #663300;">was</span><a href="#f4644"><sup>4</sup></a> distinguished
by Piety <a name="fr4645">towards</a> the Gods, and Justice towards <span style="color: #663300;">Men</span><a href="#f4645"><sup>5</sup></a> and at the same
time by taking away his Gifts from the Impious and Undeserving. This
produces several merry Incidents, till in the last Act <i>Mercury</i>
descends with great Complaints from the Gods, that since the Good Men
were grown Rich they had received no Sacrifices, which is confirmed by a
Priest of <i>Jupiter</i>, who enters with a Remonstrance, that since this
late Innovation he was reduced to a starving Condition, and could not
live upon his Office. <i>Chremylus</i>, who in the beginning of the Play was
Religious in his Poverty, concludes it with a Proposal which was
relished by all the Good Men who were now grown rich as well as himself,
that they should carry <i>Plutus</i> in a Solemn Procession to the Temple,
and Install him in the Place of <i>Jupiter</i>. This Allegory instructed the
<i>Athenians</i> in two Points, first, as it vindicated the Conduct of
Providence in its ordinary Distributions of Wealth; and in the next
Place, as it shewed the great Tendency of Riches to corrupt the Morals
of those who possessed them.<br>

<br>

Having endeavoured in my last <i>Saturday's</i> Paper to shew the great
Excellency of Faith, I here consider what are proper Means of
strengthning and confirming it in the Mind of Man. Those who delight in
reading Books of Controversie, which are written on both sides of the
Question in Points of Faith, do very seldom arrive at a fixed and
settled Habit of it. They are one Day entirely convinced of its
important Truths, and <a name="fr4651">the</a> next meet with something that shakes and
disturbs them. The Doubt <span style="color: #663300;">which</span><a href="#f4651"><sup>1</sup></a> was laid revives again, and shews
it self in new Difficulties, and that generally for this Reason, because
the Mind which is perpetually tost in Controversies and Disputes, is apt
to forget the Reasons which had once set it at rest, and to be
disquieted with any former Perplexity, when it appears in a new Shape,
or is started by a different Hand. As nothing is more laudable than an
Enquiry after Truth, so nothing is more irrational than to pass away our
whole Lives, without determining our selves one way or other in those
Points which are of the last Importance to us. There are indeed many
things from which we may with-hold our Assent; but in Cases by which we
are to regulate our Lives, it is the greatest Absurdity to be wavering
and unsettled, without closing with that Side which appears the most
safe and [the] most probable. The first Rule therefore which I shall lay
down is this, that when by Reading or Discourse we find our selves
thoroughly convinced of the Truth of any Article, and of the
Reasonableness of our Belief in it, we should never after suffer our
selves to call it into question. We may perhaps forget the Arguments
which occasioned our Conviction, but we ought to remember the Strength
they had with us, and therefore still to retain the Conviction which
they once produced. This is no more than what we do in every common Art
or Science, nor is it possible to act otherwise, considering the
Weakness and Limitation of our Intellectual Faculties. It was thus, that
<i>Latimer</i>, one of the glorious Army of Martyrs who introduced the
Reformation in <i>England</i>, behaved himself in that great Conference which
was managed between the most learned among the Protestants and Papists
in the Reign of Queen <i>Mary</i>. This venerable old Man knowing how his
Abilities were impaired by Age, and that it was impossible for him to
recollect all those Reasons which had directed him in the Choice of his
Religion, left his Companions who were in the full Possession of their
Parts and Learning, to baffle and confound their Antagonists by the
Force of Reason. As for himself he only repeated to his Adversaries the
Articles in which he firmly believed, and in the Profession of which he
was determined to die. It is in this manner that the Mathematician
proceeds upon the Propositions which he has once demonstrated; and
though the Demonstration may have slipt out of his Memory, he builds
upon the Truth, because he knows it was demonstrated. This Rule is
absolutely necessary for weaker Minds, and in some measure for Men of
the greatest Abilities; but to these last I would propose, in the second
place, that they should lay up in their Memories, and always keep by
them in a readiness, those Arguments which appear to them of the
greatest Strength, and which cannot be got over by all the Doubts and
Cavils of Infidelity.<br>
<br>
But, in the third place, there is nothing which strengthens Faith more
than Morality. Faith and Morality naturally produce each other. A Man is
quickly convinced of the Truth of Religion, who finds it is not against
his Interest that it should be true. The Pleasure he receives at
Present, and the Happiness which he promises himself from it hereafter,
will both dispose him very powerfully to give Credit to it, according to
the ordinary Observation that <i>we are easie to believe what we wish</i>. It
is very certain, that a Man of sound Reason cannot forbear closing with
Religion upon an impartial Examination of it; but at the same time it is
as certain, that Faith is kept alive in us, and gathers Strength from
Practice more than from Speculation.<br>
<br>
There is still another Method which is more Persuasive than any of the
former, and that is an habitual Adoration of the Supreme Being, as well
in constant Acts of mental Worship, as in outward Forms. The devout Man
does not only believe but feels there is a Deity. He has actual
Sensations of Him; his Experience concurs with his Reason; he sees him
more and more in all his Intercourses with him, and even in this Life
almost loses his Faith in Conviction.<br>
<br>
The last Method which I shall mention for the giving Life to a Man's
Faith, is frequent Retirement from the World, accompanied with religious
Meditation. When a Man thinks of any thing in the Darkness of the Night,
whatever deep Impressions it may make in his Mind, they are apt to
vanish as soon as the Day breaks about him. The Light and Noise of the
Day, which are perpetually soliciting his Senses, and calling off his
Attention, wear out of his Mind the Thoughts that imprinted themselves
in it, with so much Strength, during the Silence and Darkness of the
Night. A Man finds the same Difference as to himself in a Crowd and in a
Solitude: the Mind is stunned and dazzled amidst that Variety of Objects
which press upon her in a great City: She cannot apply herself to the
Consideration of these Things which are of the utmost Concern to her.
The Cares or Pleasures of the World strike in with <a name="fr4652">every</a> Thought, and a
Multitude of vicious Examples <span style="color: #663300;">give</span><a href="#f4652"><sup>2</sup></a> a kind of Justification <span style="color: #663300;">to</span><a href="#f4653"><sup>3</sup></a> our Folly. In our Retirements every thing disposes us to be
serious. In Courts and Cities we are entertained with the Works of Men;
in the Country with those of God. One is the Province of Art, the other
of Nature. Faith and Devotion naturally grow in the Mind of every
reasonable Man, who sees the Impressions of Divine Power and Wisdom in
every Object on which he casts his Eye. The Supream Being has made the
best Arguments for his own Existence, in the Formation of the Heavens
and the Earth, and these are Arguments which a Man of Sense cannot
forbear attending to, who is out of the Noise and Hurry of Human
Affairs. <i>Aristotle</i> says, that should a Man live under Ground, and
there converse with Works of Art and Mechanism, and should afterwards be
brought up into the open Day, and see the several Glories of the Heaven
and Earth, he would immediately pronounce them the Works of such a Being
as we define God to be. The <a name="fr4654">Psalmist</a> has very beautiful Strokes of
Poetry to this Purpose, in that exalted Strain, <i>The Heavens declare the
Glory of God: And the Firmament showeth his handy-work. One Day telleth
another: And one Night certifieth another. There is neither Speech nor
Language: But their Voices are heard among them. Their Sound is gone out
into all Lands: And their Words into the Ends of the World.</i><a href="#f4654"><sup>4</sup></a> As such
a bold and sublime manner of Thinking furnishes very noble Matter for an
Ode, the Reader may see it wrought into the following one<a href="#f4655"><sup>5</sup></a>.<br>

<br>
Virg.<a href="transindex.html#466t"><img src="images/qmark.png" width="15" height="15" align="right" alt="translation"></a></blockquote><br>
<br>

When <i>&AElig;neas</i>, the Hero of <i>Virgil</i>, is lost in the Wood, and a perfect
Stranger in the Place on which he is landed, he is accosted by a Lady in
an Habit for the Chase. She enquires of him, Whether he has seen pass by
that Way any young Woman dressed as she was? Whether she were following
the Sport in the Wood, or any other Way employed, according to the
Custom of Huntresses? The Hero answers with the Respect due to the
beautiful Appearance she made, tells her, He saw no such Person as she
enquired for: but intimates, that he knows her to be of the Deities, and
de<b>Sir</b> es she would conduct a Stranger. Her Form from her first Appearance
manifested she was more than mortal; but tho' she was certainly a
Goddess, the Poet does not make her known to be the Goddess of <i>Beauty</i>
till she moved: All the Charms of an agreeable Person are then in their
highest Exertion, every Limb and Feature appears with its respective
Grace. It is from this Observation, <a name="fr4661">that</a> I cannot help being so
passionate an Admirer as I am of good Dancing<a href="#f4661"><sup>1</sup></a>. As all Art is an
Imitation of Nature, this is an Imitation of Nature in its highest
Excellence, and at a Time when she is most agreeable. The Business of
Dancing is to display Beauty, and for that Reason all Distortions and
Mimickries, as such, are what raise Aversion instead of Pleasure: But
Things that are in themselves excellent, are ever attended with
Imposture and false Imitation. Thus, as in Poetry there are laborious
Fools who write Anagrams and Acrosticks, there are Pretenders in
Dancing, who think meerly to do what others cannot, is to excel. Such
Creatures should be rewarded like him who had acquired a Knack of
throwing a Grain of Corn through the Eye of <a name="fr4662">a</a> Needle, with a Bushel to
keep his Hand in Use. The <span style="color: #663300;">Dancers</span><a href="#f4662"><sup>2</sup></a> on our Stages are very faulty in
this Kind; and what they mean by writhing themselves into such Postures,
as it would be a Pain for any of the <b>Spectators</b> to stand in, and yet
hope to please those <b>Spectators</b>, is unintelligible. Mr. <i>Prince</i> has a
Genius, if he were encouraged, would prompt them to better things. In
all the Dances he invents, you see he keeps close to the Characters he
represents. He does not hope to please by making his Performers move in
a manner in which no one else ever did, but by Motions proper to the
Characters he represents. He gives to Clowns and Lubbards clumsie
Graces, that is, he makes them Practise what they would think Graces:
And I have seen Dances of his, which might give Hints that would be
useful to a Comick Writer. These Performances have pleas'd the Taste of
such as have not Reflection enough to know their Excellence, because
they are in Nature; and the distorted Motions of others have offended
those who could not form Reasons to themselves for their Displeasure,
from their being a Contradiction to Nature.<br>
<br>
When one considers the inexpressible Advantage there is in arriving at
some Excellence in this Art, it is monstrous to behold it so much
neglected. The following Letter has in it something very natural on this
Subject.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  I am a Widower with but one Daughter; she was by Nature much inclined
  to be a Romp, and I had no way of educating her, but commanding a
  young Woman, whom I entertained to take Care of her, to be very
  watchful in her Care and Attendance about her. I am a Man of Business,
  and obliged to be much abroad. The Neighbours have told me, that in my
  Absence our Maid has let in the Spruce Servants in the Neighbourhood
  to Junketings, while my Girl play'd and romped even in the Street. To
  tell you the plain Truth, I catched her once, at eleven Years old, at
  Chuck-Farthing among the Boys. This put me upon new Thoughts about my
  Child, and I determined to place her at a Boarding-School, and at the
  same Time gave a very discreet young Gentlewoman her Maintenance at
  the same Place and Rate, to be her Companion. I took little Notice of
  my Girl from Time to Time, but saw her now and then in good Health,
  out of Harm's way, and was satisfied. But by much Importunity I was
  lately prevailed with to go to one of their Balls. I cannot express to
  you the anxiety my silly Heart was in, when I saw my Romp, now
  fifteen, taken out: I never felt the pangs of a Father upon me so
  strongly in my whole Life before; and I could not have suffered more,
  had my whole Fortune been at Stake. My Girl came on with the most
  becoming Modesty I had ever seen, and casting a respectful Eye, as if
  she feared me more than all the Audience, I gave a Nod, which, I
  think, gave her all the Spirit she assumed upon it, but she rose
  properly to that Dignity of Aspect. My Romp, now the most graceful
  Person of her Sex, assumed a Majesty which commanded the highest
  Respect; and when she turned to me, and saw my Face in Rapture, she
  fell into the prettiest Smile, and I saw in all her Motion that she
  exulted in her Father's Satisfaction. You, Mr. SPECTATOR, will, better
  than I can tell you, imagine to yourself all the different Beauties
  and Changes of Aspect in an accomplished young Woman, setting forth
  all her Beauties with a Design to please no one so much as her Father.
  My Girl's Lover can never know half the Satisfaction that I did in her
  that Day. I could not possibly have imagined, that so great
  Improvement could have been wrought by an Art that I always held in it
  self ridiculous and contemptible. There is, I am convinced, no Method
  like this, to give young Women a Sense of their own Value and Dignity;
  and I am sure there can be none so expeditious to communicate that
  Value to others. As for the flippant insipidly Gay and wantonly
  Forward, whom you behold among Dancers, that Carriage is more to be
  attributed to the perverse Genius of the Performers, than imputed to
  the Art it self. For my Part, my Child has danced her self into my
  Esteem, and I have as great an Honour for her as ever I had for her
  Mother, from whom she derived those latent good Qualities which
  appeared in her Countenance when she was dancing; for my Girl, tho' I
  say it my self, shewed in one Quarter of an Hour the innate Principles
  of a modest Virgin, a tender Wife, a generous Friend, a kind Mother,
  and an indulgent Mistress. I'll strain hard but I will purchase for
  her an Husband suitable to her Merit. I am your Convert in the
  Admiration of what I thought you jested when you recommended; and if
  you please to be at my House on <i>Thursday</i> next, I make a Ball for my
  Daughter, and you shall see her Dance, or, if you will do her that
  Honour, dance with her. <i>I am, <b>Sir</b> ,<br>
<br>
  Your most humble Servant</i>,<br>
<br>
  <b>Philipater</b>.</blockquote>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
I have some time ago spoken of a Treatise written by Mr. <i>Weaver</i> on
this Subject, which is now, I understand, ready to be published. This
Work sets this Matter in a very plain and advantageous Light; and I am
convinced from it, that if the Art was under proper Regulations, it
would be a mechanick way of implanting insensibly in Minds, not capable
of receiving it so well by any other Rules, a Sense of good Breeding and
Virtue.<br>
<br>
Were any one to see <i>Mariamne</i> Dance, let him be never so sensual a
Brute, I defie him to entertain any Thoughts but of the highest Respect
and Esteem towards her. I was shewed last Week a Picture in a Lady's
Closet, for which she had an hundred different Dresses, that she could
clap on round the Face, on purpose to demonstrate the force of Habits in
the diversity of the same Countenance. Motion, and change of Posture and
Aspect, has an Effect no less surprising on the Person of <i>Mariamne</i>
when she Dances.<br>
<br>
<i>Chloe</i> is extremely pretty, and as silly as she is pretty. This Ideot
has a very good Ear, and a most agreeable Shape; but the Folly of the
Thing is such, that it Smiles so impertinently, and affects to please so
sillily, that while she Dances you see the Simpleton from Head to Foot.
For you must know (as Trivial as this Art is thought to be) no one ever
was a good Dancer, that had not a good Understanding. If this be a
Truth, I shall leave the Reader to judge from that Maxim, what Esteem
they ought to have for such Impertinents as fly, hop, caper, tumble,
twirl, turn round, and jump over their Heads, and, in a Word, play a
thousand Pranks which many Animals can do better than a Man, instead of
performing to Perfection what the human Figure only is capable of
Performing.<br>
<br>
It may perhaps appear odd, that I, who set up for a mighty Lover, at
least, of Virtue, should take so much Pains to recommend what the
soberer Part of Mankind look upon to be a Trifle; but under Favour of
the soberer Part of Mankind, I think they have not enough considered
this Matter, and for that Reason only disesteem it. I must also, in my
own Justification, say that I attempt to bring into the Service of
Honour and Virtue every Thing in Nature that can pretend to give elegant
Delight. It may possibly be proved, that Vice is in it self destructive
of Pleasure, and Virtue in it self conducive to it. If the Delights of a
free Fortune were under proper Regulations, this Truth would not want
much Argument to support it; but it would be obvious to every Man, that
there is a strict Affinity between all Things that are truly laudable
and beautiful, from the highest Sentiment of the Soul, to the most
indifferent Gesture of the Body.<br>

<br>

The Love of Praise is a Passion deeply fixed in the Mind of every
extraordinary Person, and those who are most affected with it, seem most
to partake of that Particle of the Divinity which distinguishes Mankind
from the Inferior Creation. The Supreme Being it self is most pleased
with Praise and Thanksgiving; the other Part of our Duty is but an
Acknowledgment of our Faults, whilst this is the immediate Adoration of
his Perfections. 'Twas an excellent Observation, That we then only
despise Commendation when we cease to deserve it: <a name="fr4671">and</a> we have still
extant two Orations of <i>Tully</i> and <i>Pliny</i>, spoken to the greatest and
best Princes of all the <i>Roman</i> Emperors<a href="#f4671"><sup>1</sup></a>, who, no doubt, heard with
the greatest Satisfaction, what even the most disinterested Persons, and
at so large a Distance of Time, cannot read without Admiration. <i>C&aelig;sar</i>
thought his Life consisted in the Breath of Praise, when he professed he
had lived long enough for himself when he had for his Glory; others have
sacrificed themselves for a Name which was not to begin till they were
dead, giving away themselves to purchase a Sound which was not to
commence till they were out of hearing: But by Merit and superior
Excellencies not only to gain, but, whilst living, to enjoy a great and
universal Reputation, is the last Degree of Happiness which we can hope
for here. Bad Characters are dispersed abroad with Profusion, I hope for
example Sake, and (as Punishments are designed by the Civil Power) more
for the deterring the Innocent, than the chastising the Guilty. The Good
are less frequent, whether it be that there are indeed fewer Originals
of this Kind to copy after, or that, thro' the Malignity of our Nature,
we rather delight in the Ridicule than the Virtues we find in others.
However, it is but just, as well as pleasing, even for Variety,
sometimes to give the World a Representation of the bright Side of
humane Nature, as well as the dark and gloomy: The De<b>Sir</b> e of Imitation
may, perhaps, be a greater Incentive to the Practice of what is good,
than the Aversion we may conceive at what is blameable; the one
immediately directs you what you should do, whilst the other only shews
you what you should avoid: <a name="fr4672">And</a> I cannot at present do this with more
Satisfaction, than by endeavouring to do some Justice to the Character
of <i>Manilius</i><a href="#f4672"><sup>2</sup></a>.<br>
<br>
It would far exceed my present Design, to give a particular Description
of <i>Manilius</i> thro' all the Parts of his excellent Life: I shall now
only draw him in his Retirement, and pass over in Silence the various
Arts, the courtly Manners, and the undesigning Honesty by which he
attained the Honours he has enjoyed, and which now give a Dignity and
Veneration to the Ease he does enjoy. Tis here that he looks back with
Pleasure on the Waves and Billows thro' which he has steered to so fair
an Haven; he is now intent upon the Practice of every Virtue, which a
great Knowledge and Use of Mankind has discovered to be the most useful
to them. Thus in his private domestick Employments he is no less
glorious than in his publick; for 'tis in Reality a more difficult Task
to be conspicuous in a sedentary inactive Life, than in one that is
spent in Hurry and Business; Persons engaged in the latter, like Bodies
violently agitated, from the Swiftness of their Motion have a Brightness
added to them, which often vanishes when they are at Rest; but if it
then still remain, it must be the Seeds of intrinsick Worth that thus
shine out without any foreign Aid or Assistance.<br>
<br>
His Liberality in another might almost bear the Name of Profusion; he
seems to think it laudable even in the Excess, like that River which
most enriches when it overflows: But <i>Manilius</i> has too perfect a Taste
of the Pleasure of doing good, ever to let it be out of his Power; and
for that Reason he will have a just &&oelig;lig;conomy, and a splendid Frugality
at home, the Fountain from whence those Streams should flow which he
disperses abroad. He looks with Disdain on those who propose their Death
as the Time when they are to begin their Munificence; he will both see
and enjoy (which he then does in the highest Degree) what he bestows
himself; he will be the living Executor of his own Bounty, whilst they
who have the Happiness to be within his Care and Patronage at once, pray
for the Continuation of his Life, and their own good Fortune. No one is
out of the reach of his Obligations; he knows how, by proper and
becoming Methods, to raise himself to a Level with those of the highest
Rank; and his good Nature is a sufficient Warrant against the Want of
those who are so unhappy as to be in the very lowest. <a name="fr4673">One</a> may say of
him, as <i>Pindar</i> bids his Muse say of <i>Theron</i><a href="#f4673"><sup>3</sup></a>:

<blockquote><i>Swear, that</i> Theron <i>sure has sworn,<br>
  No one near him should be Poor.<br>
Swear, that none e'er had such a graceful Art,<br>
Fortune's Free-Gifts as freely to impart,<br>
With an unenvious Hand, and an unbounded Heart.</i></blockquote>

Never did <i>Atticus</i> succeed better in gaining the universal Love and
Esteem of all Men; nor steer with more Success betwixt the Extreams of
two contending Parties. 'Tis his peculiar Happiness, that while he
espouses neither with an intemperate Zeal, he is not only admired, but,
what is a more rare and unusual Felicity, he is beloved and caressed by
both and I never yet saw any Person of whatsoever Age or Sex, but was
immediately struck with the Merit of <i>Manilius</i>. There are many who are
acceptable to some particular Persons, whilst the rest of Mankind look
upon them with Coldness and Indifference but he is the first whose
entire good Fortune it is ever to please and to be pleased, where-ever
he comes to be admired, and where-ever he is absent to be lamented. His
Merit fares like the Pictures of <i>Raphael</i>, which are either seen with
Admiration by all, or at least no one dare own he has no Taste for a
Composition which has received so universal an Applause. Envy and Malice
find it against their Interest to indulge Slander and Obloquy. 'Tis as
hard for an Enemy to detract from as for a Friend to add to his Praise.
An Attempt upon his Reputation is a sure lessening of one's own; and
there is but one Way to injure him, which is to refuse him his just
Commendations, and be obstinately silent.<br>
<br>
It is below him to catch the Sight with any Care of Dress; his outward
Garb is but the Emblem of his Mind, it is genteel, plain, and
unaffected; he knows that Gold and Embroidery can add nothing to the
Opinion which all have of his Merit, and that he gives a Lustre to the
plainest Dress, whilst 'tis impossible the richest should communicate
any to him. He is still the principal Figure in the Room: He first
engages your Eye, as if there were some Point of Light which shone
stronger upon him than on any other Person.<br>
<br>
<a name="fr4674">He</a> puts me in mind of a Story of the famous <i>Bussy d'Amboise</i><a href="#f4674"><sup>4</sup></a>, who
at an Assembly at Court, where every one appeared with the utmost
Magnificence, relying upon his own superior Behaviour, instead of
adorning himself like the rest, put on that Day a plain Suit of Cloaths,
and dressed all his Servants in the most costly gay Habits he could
procure: The Event was, that the Eyes of the whole Court were fixed upon
him, all the rest looked like his Attendants, whilst he alone had the
Air of a Person of Quality and Distinction.<br>
<br>
Like <i>Aristippus</i>, whatever Shape or Condition he appears in, it still
sits free and easie upon him; but in some Part of his Character, 'tis
true, he differs from him; for as he is altogether equal to the
Largeness of his present Circumstances, the Rectitude of his Judgment
has so far corrected the Inclinations of his Ambition, that he will not
trouble himself with either the De<b>Sir</b> es or Pursuits of any thing beyond
his present Enjoyments.<br>
<br>
A thousand obliging Things flow from him upon every Occasion, and they
are always so just and natural, that it is impossible to think he was at
the least Pains to look for them. One would think it were the D&aelig;mon of
good Thoughts that discovered to him those Treasures, which he must have
blinded others from seeing, they lay so directly in their Way. Nothing
can equal the Pleasure is taken in hearing him speak, but the
Satisfaction one receives in the Civility and Attention he pays to the
Discourse of others. His Looks are a silent Commendation of what is good
and praise-worthy, and a secret Reproof to what is licentious and
extravagant. He knows how to appear free and open without Danger of
Intrusion, and to be cautious without seeming reserved. The Gravity of
his Conversation is always enlivened with his Wit and Humour, and the
Gaiety of it is tempered with something that is instructive, as well as
barely agreeable. Thus with him you are sure not to be merry at the
Expence of your Reason, nor serious with the Loss of your good Humour;
but, by a happy mixture in his Temper, they either go together, or
perpetually succeed each other. In fine, his whole Behaviour is equally
distant from Constraint and Negligence, and he commands your Respect,
whilst he gains your Heart.<br>
<br>
There is in his whole Carriage such an engaging Softness, that one
cannot persuade one's self he is ever actuated by those rougher
Passions, which, where-ever they find Place, seldom fail of shewing
themselves in the outward Demeanour of the Persons they belong to: But
his Constitution is a just Temperature between Indolence on one hand and
Violence on the other. He is mild and gentle, where-ever his Affairs
will give him Leave to follow his own Inclinations; but yet never
failing to exert himself with Vigour and Resolution in the Service of
his Prince, his Country, or his Friend.<br>

<blockquote><i>  Erat Homo ingeniosus, acutus, acer, et qui plurimum et salis haberet
  et fellis, nec candoris minus.</i><br>
<br>
Plin. <i>Epist.</i><a href="transindex.html#468t"><img src="images/qmark.png" width="15" height="15" align="right" alt="translation"></a></blockquote><br>
<br>

My Paper is in a kind a Letter of News, but it regards rather what
passes in the World of Conversation than that of Business. I am very
sorry that I have at present a Circumstance before me, which is of very
great <a name="fr4681">Importance</a> to all who have a Relish for Gayety, Wit, Mirth, or
Humour; I mean the Death of poor <i>Dick Eastcourt</i><a href="#f4681"><sup>1</sup></a>. I have been
oblig'd to him for so many Hours of Jollity, that it is but a small
Recompence, tho' all I can give him, to pass a Moment or two in Sadness
for the Loss of so agreeable a Man. Poor <i>Eastcourt</i>! the last Time I
saw him we were plotting to shew the Town his great Capacity for acting
in its full Light, by introducing him as dictating to a Set of young
Players, in what manner to speak this Sentence, and utter t'other
Passion&mdash;He had so exquisite a Discerning of what was defective in any
Object before him, that in an Instant he could shew you the ridiculous
Side of what would pass for beautiful and just, even to Men of no ill
Judgment, before he had pointed at the Failure. He was no less skilful
in the Knowledge of Beauty; and, I dare say, there is no one who knew
him well, but can repeat more well-turned Compliments, as well as smart
Repartees, of Mr. <i>Eastcourt's</i>, than of any other Man in <i>England</i>.
This was easily to be observed in his inimitable Faculty of telling a
Story, in which he would throw in natural and unexpected Incidents to
make his Court to one Part, and rally the other Part of the Company:
Then he would vary the Usage he gave them, according as he saw them bear
kind or sharp Language. He had the Knack to raise up a pensive Temper,
and mortifie an impertinently gay one, with the most agreeable Skill
imaginable. There are a thousand things which crowd into my Memory,
which make me too much concerned to tell on about him. <i>Hamlet</i> holding
up the Skull which the Grave-digger threw to him, with an Account that
it was the Head of the King's Jester, falls into very pleasing
Reflections, and cries out to his Companion,

<blockquote>  <i>Alas, poor</i> Yorick! <i>I knew him,</i> Horatio, <i>a Fellow of infinite Jest,
  of most excellent Fancy; he hath born me on his Back a thousand times:
  And how abhorred my Imagination is now, my Gorge rises at it. Here
  hung those Lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your
  Gibes now, your Gambols, your Songs, your Flashes of Merriment, that
  were wont to set the Table on a Roar: No one now to mock your own
  Jeerings: quite Chop-fallen. Now get you to my Lady's Chamber, and
  tell her, Let her paint an Inch thick, to this Favour she must come.
  Make her laugh at that.</i></blockquote>

It is an Insolence natural to the Wealthy, to affix, as much as in them
lies, the Character of a Man to his Circumstances. Thus it is ordinary
with them to praise faintly the good Qualities of those below them, and
say, It is very extraordinary in such a Man as he is, or the like, when
they are forced to acknowledge the Value of him whose Lowness upbraids
their Exaltation. It is to this Humour only, that it is to be ascribed,
that a quick Wit in Conversation, a nice Judgment upon any Emergency,
that could arise, and a most blameless inoffensive Behaviour, could not
raise this Man above being received only upon the Foot of contributing
to Mirth and Diversion. But he was as easy under that Condition, as a
Man of so excellent Talents was capable; and since they would have it,
that to divert was his Business, he did it with all the seeming Alacrity
imaginable, tho' it stung him to the Heart that it was his Business. Men
of Sense, who could taste his Excellencies, were well satisfied to let
him lead the Way in Conversation, and play after his own Manner; but
Fools who provoked him to Mimickry, found he had the Indignation to let
it be at their Expence who called for it, and he would shew the Form of
conceited heavy Fellows as Jests to the Company at their own Request, in
Revenge for interrupting him from being a Companion to put on the
Character of a Jester.<br>
<br>
What was peculiarly excellent in this memorable Companion, was, that in
the Accounts he gave of Persons and Sentiments, he did not only hit the
Figure of their Faces, and Manner of their Gestures, but he would in his
Narration fall into their very Way of thinking, and this when he
recounted Passages, wherein Men of the best Wit were concerned, as well
as such wherein were represented Men of the lowest Rank of
Understanding. It is certainly as great an Instance of Self-love to a
Weakness, to be impatient of being mimick'd, as any can be imagined.
There were none but the Vain, the Formal, the Proud, or those who were
incapable of amending their Faults, that dreaded him; to others he was
in the highest Degree pleasing; and I do not know any Satisfaction of
any indifferent kind I ever tasted so much, as having got over an
Impatience of seeing my self in the Air he could put me when I have
displeased him. It is indeed to his exquisite Talent this way, more than
any Philosophy I could read on the Subject, that my Person is very
little of my Care; and it is indifferent to me what is said of my Shape,
my Air, my Manner, my Speech, or my Address. It is to poor <i>Eastcourt</i> I
chiefly owe that I am arrived at the Happiness of thinking nothing a
Diminution to me, but what argues a Depravity of my Will.<br>
<br>
It has as much surprized me as any thing in Nature, to have it
frequently said, That he was not a good Player: But that must be owing
to a Partiality for former Actors in the Parts in which he succeeded
them, and judging by Comparison of what was liked before, rather than by
the Nature of the Thing. When <a name="fr4682">a</a> Man of his Wit and Smartness could put
on an utter Absence of common Sense in his Face as he did in the
Character of <i>Bulfinch</i> in the <i>Northern Lass</i><a href="#f4682"><sup>2</sup></a> and an <a name="fr4683">Air</a> of insipid
Cunning and Vivacity in the Character of <i>Pounce</i> in the <i>Tender
Husband</i><a href="#f4683"><sup>3</sup></a>, it is Folly to dispute his Capacity and Success, as he was
an Actor.<br>
<br>
Poor <i>Eastcourt</i>! let the Vain and Proud be at Rest; thou wilt no more
disturb their Admiration of their dear selves, and thou art no longer to
drudge in raising the Mirth of Stupids, who know nothing of thy Merit,
for thy Maintenance.<br>
<br>
It is natural for the Generality of Mankind to run into Reflections upon
our Mortality, when Disturbers of the World are laid at Rest, but to
take no Notice when they who can please and divert are pulled from us:
But for my Part, I cannot but think the Loss of such Talents as the Man
of whom I am speaking was Master of, a more melancholy Instance of
Mortality, than the Dissolution of Persons of never so high Characters
in the World, whose Pretensions were that they were noisy and
mischievous.<br>
<br>
But I must grow more succinct, and as a SPECTATOR, give an Account of
this extraordinary Man, who, in his Way, never had an Equal in any Age
before him, or in that wherein he lived. I speak of him as a Companion,
and a Man qualified for Conversation. His Fortune exposed him to an
Obsequiousness towards the worst Sort of Company, but his excellent
Qualities rendered him capable of making the best Figure in the most
refined. I have been present with him among Men of the most delicate
Taste a whole Night, and have known him (for he saw it was de<b>Sir</b> ed) keep
the Discourse to himself the most Part of it, and maintain his good
Humour with a Countenance in a Language so delightful, without Offence
to any Person or Thing upon Earth, still preserving the Distance his
Circumstances obliged him to; I say, I have seen him do all this in such
a charming manner, that I am sure none of those I hint at will read
this, without giving him some Sorrow for their abundant Mirth, and one
Gush of Tears for so many Bursts of Laughter. I <a name="fr4684">wish</a> it were any Honour
to the pleasant Creature's Memory, that my Eyes are too much suffused to
let me <span style="color: #663300;">go on&mdash;.</span><a href="#f4684"><sup>4</sup></a><br>

This passage, omitted from the reprint, expresses Steele's anger at the
neglect of Estcourt in his last hours by Dr. John Radcliffe, one of the
chief physicians of the time, who as a rough-spoken humourist made many
enemies, and was condemned as an empiric by many of his professional
brethren. When called, in 1699, to attend King William, who asked his
opinion on his swollen ankles, he said, 'I would not have your Majesty's
two legs for your three kingdoms.' His maxim for making a fortune was to
use all men ill, but Mead, it has been observed, made more money by the
opposite method. Not very long after this bitter censure of Radcliffe
for neglect of Estcourt, attempts were made to censure him formally in
the House of Commons for refusal to attend in the last illness of Queen
Anne, although requested to do so by the Privy Council. He denied that
he had been asked to attend. He died himself three months after the
Queen (in 1714, aged 64), his last days embittered by the public odium
following the charge of disrespect to his dying sovereign. He died
unmarried, and left the greater part of his money to beneficent uses,
among them the erection of an infirmary and of the Radcliffe Library in
Oxford.<br>

I am perswaded there are few Men of generous Principles, who would seek
after great Places, were it not rather to have an Opportunity in their
Hands of obliging their particular Friends, or those whom they look upon
as Men of Worth, than to procure Wealth and Honour for themselves. To an
honest Mind the best Perquisites of a Place are the Advantages it gives
a Man of doing Good.<br>
<br>
Those who are under the great Officers of State, and are the Instruments
by which they act, have more frequent Opportunities for the Exercise of
Compassion, and Benevolence, than their Superiors themselves. These Men
know every little Case that is to come before the Great Man, and if they
are possessed with honest Minds, will consider Poverty as a
Recommendation in the Person who applies himself to them, and make the
Justice of his Cause the most powerful Solicitor in his Behalf. A Man of
this Temper, when he is in a Post of Business, becomes a Blessing to the
Publick: He patronizes the Orphan and the Widow, assists the Friendless,
and guides the Ignorant: He does not reject the Person's Pretensions,
who does not know how to explain them, or refuse doing a good Office for
a Man because he cannot pay the Fee of it. In <a name="fr4691">short</a>, tho' he regulates
himself in all his Proceedings by Justice and Equity, he finds a
thousand <span style="color: #663300;">Occasions for all the Good-natured Offices of</span><a href="#f4691"><sup>1</sup></a> Generosity
and Compassion.<br>
<br>
A Man is unfit for such a Place of Trust, who is of a sower untractable
Nature, or has any other Passion that makes him uneasie to those who
approach him. Roughness of Temper is apt to discountenance the Timorous
or Modest. The proud Man discourages those from approaching him, who are
of a mean Condition, and who most want his Assistance. The impatient Man
will not give himself time to be informed of the Matter that lies before
him. An Officer with one or more of these unbecoming Qualities, is
sometimes looked upon as a proper Person to keep off Impertinence and
Solicitation from his Superior; but this is a kind of Merit, that can
never attone for the Injustice which may very often arise from it.<br>
<br>
There are two other vicious Qualities which render a Man very unfit for
such a Place of Trust. The first of these is a Dilatory Temper, which
commits innumerable Cruelties without Design. The Maxim which several
have laid down for a Man's Conduct in ordinary Life should be inviolable
with a Man in Office, never to think of doing that To-morrow which may
be done To-day. A Man who defers doing what ought to be done, is guilty
of Injustice so long as he defers it. The Dispatch of a good Office is
very often as beneficial to the Solicitor as the good Office it self. In
short, if a Man compared the Inconveniences which another suffers by his
Delays, with the trifling Motives and Advantages which he himself may
reap by such a Delay, he would never be guilty of a Fault which very
often does an irreparable Prejudice to the Person who depends upon him,
and which might be remedied with little Trouble to himself.<br>
<br>
But in the last Place, there is no Man so improper to be employed in
Business, as he who is in any degree capable of Corruption; and such an
one is the Man, who, upon any Pretence whatsoever, receives more than
what is the stated and unquestioned Fee of his Office. Gratifications,
Tokens of Thankfulness, Dispatch Money, and the like specious Terms, are
the Pretences under which Corruption very frequently shelters it self.
An honest Man will however look on all these Methods as unjustifiable,
and will enjoy himself better in a moderate Fortune that is gained with
honour and Reputation, than in an overgrown Estate that is cankered with
the Acquisitions of Rapine and Exaction. Were all our Offices discharged
with such an inflexible Integrity, we should not see Men in all Ages,
who grow up to exorbitant Wealth with the Abilities which are to be met
with in an ordinary Mechanick. I cannot but think that such a Corruption
proceeds chiefly from Mens employing the first that offer themselves, or
those who have the Character of shrewd worldly Men, instead of searching
out such as have had a liberal Education, and have been trained up in
the Studies of Knowledge and Virtue.<br>
<br>
It has been observed, that Men of Learning who take to Business,
discharge it generally with greater Honesty than Men of the World. The
chief Reason for it I take to be as follows. A Man that has spent his
Youth in Reading, has been used to find Virtue extolled, and Vice
stigmatized. A Man that has past his Time in the World, has often seen
Vice triumphant, and Virtue discountenanced. Extortion, Rapine and
Injustice, which are branded with Infamy in Books, often give a Man a
Figure in the World; while several Qualities which are celebrated in
Authors, as Generosity, Ingenuity and Good-Nature, impoverish and ruin
him. This cannot but have a proportionable Effect on Men, whose Tempers
and Principles are equally Good and Vicious.<br>
<br>
There would be at least this Advantage in employing Men of Learning and
Parts in Business, that their Prosperity would set more gracefully on
them, and that we should not see many worthless Persons shot up into the
greatest Figures of Life.<br>

I have been very often disappointed of late Years, when upon examining
the new Edition of a Classick Author, I have found above half the Volume
taken up with various Readings. When I have expected to meet with a
learned Note upon a doubtful Passage in a <i>Latin</i> Poet, I have only been
informed, that such or such Ancient Manuscripts for an <i>et</i> write an
<i>ac</i>, or of some other notable Discovery of the like Importance. Indeed,
when a different Reading gives us a different Sense, or a new Elegance
in an Author, the Editor does very well in taking Notice of it; but when
he only entertains us with the several ways of spelling the same Word,
and gathers together the various Blunders and Mistakes of twenty or
thirty different Transcribers, they only take up the Time of the learned
Reader, and puzzle the Minds of the Ignorant. I have often fancied with
my self how enraged an old <i>Latin</i> Author would be, should he see the
several Absurdities in Sense and Grammar, which are imputed to him by
some or other of these various Readings. In one he speaks Nonsense; in
another, makes use of a Word that was never heard of: And indeed there
is scarce a Solecism in Writing which the best Author is not guilty of,
if we may be at Liberty to read him in the Words of some Manuscript,
which the laborious Editor has thought fit to examine in the Prosecution
of his Work.<br>
<br>
I question not but the Ladies and pretty Fellows will be very curious to
understand what it is that I have been hitherto talking of. I shall
therefore give them a Notion of this Practice, by endeavouring to write
after the manner of several Persons who make an eminent Figure in the
Republick of Letters. To <a name="fr4701">this</a> end we will suppose that the following <span style="color: #663300;">Song</span><a href="#f4701"><sup>1</sup></a> is an old Ode which I present to the Publick in a new
Edition, with the several various Readings which I find of it in former
Editions, and in Ancient Manuscripts. Those who cannot relish the
various Readings, will perhaps find their Account in the Song, which
never before appeared in Print.

<blockquote><i>My Love was fickle once and changing,<br>
   Nor e'er would settle in my Heart;<br>
From Beauty still to Beauty ranging,<br>
   In ev'ry Face I found a Dart.<br><br>

'Twas first a charming Shape enslav'd me,<br>
   An Eye then gave the fatal Stroke;<br>
'Till by her Wit</i> Corinna <i>sav'd me,<br>
   And all my former Fetters broke.<br><br>

But now a long and lasting Anguish<br>
   For</i> Belvidera <i>I endure;<br>
Hourly I Sigh and hourly Languish,<br>
   Nor hope to find the wonted Cure.<br><br>

For here the false unconstant Lover,<br>
   After a thousand Beauties shown,<br>
Does new surprizing Charms discover,<br>
   And finds Variety in One.</i></blockquote>
<br>

<i>Various Readings.</i><br>
<br>
Stanza the First, Verse the First. <i>And changing</i>.] The <i>and</i> in some
Manuscripts is written thus, <i>&</i>, but that in the <i>Cotton</i> Library
writes it in three distinct Letters.<br>
<br>
Verse the Second, <i>Nor e'er would</i>.] <i>Aldus</i> reads it <i>ever would</i>; but
as this would hurt the Metre, we have restored it to its genuine
Reading, by observing that <i>Syn&aelig;resis</i> which had been neglected by
ignorant Transcribers.<br>
<br>
<i>Ibid</i>. <i>In my Heart</i>.] <i>Scaliger</i>, and others, <i>on my Heart</i>.<br>
<br>
Verse the Fourth, <i>I found a Dart</i>.] The <i>Vatican</i> Manuscript for <i>I</i>
reads <i>it</i>, but this must have been the Hallucination of the
Transcriber, who probably mistook the Dash of the <i>I</i> for a <i>T</i>.<br>
<br>
Stanza the Second, Verse the Second. <i>The fatal Stroke</i>.] <i>Scioppius,
Salmasius</i> and many others, for <i>the</i> read <i>a</i>, but I have stuck to the
usual Reading.<br>
<br>
Verse the Third, <i>Till by her Wit</i>.] Some Manuscripts have it <i>his Wit</i>,
others <i>your</i>, others <i>their Wit</i>. But as I find <i>Corinna</i> to be the
Name of a Woman in other Authors, I cannot doubt but it should be <i>her</i>.<br>
<br>
Stanza the third, Verse the First. <i>A long and lasting Anguish</i>.] The
<i>German</i> Manuscript reads <i>a lasting Passion</i>, but the Rhyme will not
admit it.<br>
<br>
Verse the Second. <i>For</i> Belvidera <i>I endure</i>.] Did not all the
Manuscripts reclaim, I should change <i>Belvidera</i> into <i>Pelvidera;
Pelvis</i> being used by several of the Ancient Comick Writers for a
Looking-glass, by which means the Etymology of the Word is very visible,
and <i>Pelvidera</i> will signifie a Lady who often looks in her Glass; as
indeed she had very good reason, if she had all those Beauties which our
Poet here ascribes to her.<br>
<br>
Verse the Third. <i>Hourly I sigh and hourly languish</i>.] Some for the Word
<i>hourly</i> read <i>daily</i>, and others <i>nightly</i>; the last has great
Authorities of its side.<br>
<br>
Verse the Fourth. <i>The wonted Cure</i>.] The Elder <i>Stevens</i> reads <i>wanted
Cure</i>.<br>
<br>
Stanza the Fourth, Verse the Second. <i>After a thousand Beauties</i>] In
several Copies we meet with a <i>Hundred Beauties</i> by the usual Errour of
the Transcribers, who probably omitted a Cypher, and had not Taste
enough to know that the Word <i>Thousand</i> was ten Times a greater
Compliment to the Poet's Mistress than an <i>Hundred</i>.<br>
<br>
Verse the Fourth. <i>And finds Variety in one</i>] Most of the Ancient
Manuscripts have it <i>in two</i>. Indeed so many of them concur in this last
reading, that I am very much in doubt whether it ought not to take
place. There are but two Reasons which incline me to the Reading as I
have published it; First, because the Rhime, and, Secondly, because the
Sense is preserved by it. It might likewise proceed from the Oscitancy
of Transcribers, who, to dispatch their Work the sooner, use to write
all Numbers in Cypher, and seeing the Figure 1 following by a little
Dash of the Pen, as is customary in old Manuscripts, they perhaps
mistook the Dash for a second Figure, and by casting up both together
composed out of them the Figure 2. But this I shall leave to the
Learned, without determining any thing in a Matter of so great
Uncertainty.<br>

<br>

The <i>Time present</i> seldom affords sufficient Employment to the Mind of
Man. Objects of Pain or Pleasure, Love or Admiration, do not lie thick
enough together in Life to keep the Soul in constant Action, and supply
an immediate Exercise to its Faculties. In order, therefore, to remedy
this Defect, that the Mind may not want Business, but always have
Materials for thinking, she is endowed with certain Powers, that can
recall what is passed, and anticipate what is to come.<br>
<br>
That wonderful Faculty, which we call the Memory, is perpetually looking
back, when we have nothing present to entertain us. It is like those
Repositories in several Animals, that are filled with Stores of their
former Food, on which they may ruminate when their present Pasture
fails.<br>
<br>
As the Memory relieves the Mind in her vacant Moments, and prevents any
Chasms of Thought by Ideas of what is <i>past</i>, we have other Faculties
that agitate and employ her upon what <i>is to come</i>. These are the
Passions of Hope and Fear.<br>
<br>
By these two Passions we reach forward into Futurity, and bring up to
our present Thoughts Objects that lie hid in the remotest Depths of
Time. We suffer Misery, and enjoy Happiness, before they are in Being;
we can set the Sun and Stars forward, or lose sight of them by wandring
into those retired Parts of Eternity, when the Heavens and Earth shall
be no more.<br>
<br>
By the way, who can imagine that the Existence of a Creature is to be
circumscribed by Time, whose Thoughts are not? But I shall, in this
Paper, confine my self to that particular Passion which goes by the Name
of Hope.<br>
<br>
Our Actual Enjoyments are so few and transient, that Man would be a very
miserable Being, were he not endowed with this Passion, which gives him
a Taste of those good Things that may possibly come into his Possession.
<i>We <a name="fr4711">should</a> hope for every thing that is good</i>, says the old Poet
<i>Linus, because there is nothing which may not be hoped for, and
nothing but what the Gods are able to give us</i><a href="#f4711"><sup>1</sup></a>. Hope quickens all
the still Parts of Life, and keeps the Mind awake in her most Remiss and
Indolent Hours. It gives habitual Serenity and good Humour. It is a kind
of Vital Heat in the Soul, that cheers and gladdens her, when she does
not attend to it. It makes Pain easie, and Labour pleasant.<br>
<br>
Beside these several Advantages which rise from <i>Hope</i>, there is another
which is none of the least, and that is, its great Efficacy in
preserving us from setting too high a value on present Enjoyments. The
saying of <i>C&aelig;sar</i> is very well known. When he had given away all his
Estate in Gratuities among his Friends, one of them asked what he had
left for himself; to which that great Man replied, <i>Hope</i>. His Natural
Magnanimity hindered him from prizing what he was certainly possessed
of, and turned all his Thoughts upon something more valuable that be had
in View. I question not but every Reader will draw a Moral from this
Story, and apply it to himself without my Direction.<br>
<br>
The old Story of <i>Pandora's</i> Box (which many of the Learned believe was
formed among the Heathens upon the Tradition of the Fall of Man) shews
us how deplorable a State they thought the present Life, without Hope:
To set forth the utmost Condition of Misery they tell us, that our
Forefather, according to the Pagan Theology, had a great Vessel
presented him by <i>Pandora:</i> Upon his lifting up the Lid of it, says the
Fable, there flew out all the Calamities and Distempers incident to Men,
from which, till that time, they had been altogether exempt. <i>Hope</i>, who
had been enclosed in the Cup with so much bad Company, instead of flying
off with the rest, stuck so close to the Lid of it, that it was shut
down upon her.<br>
<br>
I shall make but two Reflections upon what I have hitherto said. First,
that no kind of Life is so happy as that which is full of Hope,
especially when the Hope is well grounded, and when the Object of it is
of an exalted kind, and in its Nature proper to make the Person happy
who enjoys it. This Proposition must be very evident to those who
consider how few are the present Enjoyments of the most happy Man, and
how insufficient to give him an entire Satisfaction and Acquiescence in
them.<br>
<br>
My next Observation is this, that a Religious Life is that which most
abounds in a well-grounded Hope, and such an one as is fixed on Objects
that are capable of making us entirely happy. This Hope in a Religious
Man, is much more sure and certain than the Hope of any Temporal
Blessing, as it is strengthened not only by Reason, but by Faith. It has
at the same time its Eye perpetually fixed on that State, which implies
in the very Notion of it the most full and the most compleat Happiness.<br>
<br>
I have before shewn how the Influence of Hope in general sweetens Life,
and makes our present Condition supportable, if not pleasing; but a
Religious Hope has still greater Advantages. It does not only bear up
the Mind under her Sufferings, but makes her rejoice in them, as they
may be the Instruments of procuring her the great and ultimate End of
all her Hope.<br>
<br>
Religious Hope has likewise this Advantage above any other kind of Hope,
that it is able to revive the <i>dying</i> Man, and to fill his Mind not only
with secret Comfort and Refreshment, but sometimes with Rapture and
Transport. He triumphs in his Agonies, whilst the Soul springs forward
with Delight to the great Object which she has always had in view, and
leaves the Body with an Expectation of being re-united to her in a
glorious and joyful Resurrection.<br>
<br>
I shall conclude <a name="fr4712">this</a> Essay with those emphatical Expressions of a
lively Hope, which the Psalmist made use of in the midst of those
Dangers and Adversities which surrounded him; for the following Passage
had its present and personal, as well as its future and prophetick
Sense.

  <blockquote><i>I have set the Lord always before me: Because he is at my right Hand,
  I shall not be moved. Therefore my Heart is glad, and my Glory
  rejoiceth: my Flesh also shall rest in hope. For thou wilt not leave
  my Soul in Hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see
  Corruption. Thou wilt shew me the Path of Life: in thy Presence is
  Fullness of Joy, at thy right Hand there are Pleasures for evermore</i><a href="#f4712"><sup>2</sup></a>.</blockquote>

I received some time ago a Proposal, which had a Preface to it, wherein
the Author discoursed at large of the innumerable Objects of Charity in
a Nation, and admonished the Rich, who were afflicted with any Distemper
of Body, particularly to regard the Poor in the same Species of
Affliction, and confine their Tenderness to them, since it is impossible
to assist all who are presented to them. The Proposer had been relieved
from a Malady in his Eyes by an Operation performed by <b>Sir</b>  <i>William
Read</i>, and being a Man of Condition, had taken a Resolution to maintain
three poor blind Men during their Lives, in Gratitude for that great
Blessing. This Misfortune is so very great and unfrequent, that one
would think, an Establishment for all the Poor under it might be easily
accomplished, with the Addition of a very few others to those Wealthy
who are in the same Calamity. However, the Thought of the Proposer arose
from a very good Motive, and the parcelling of our selves out, as called
to particular Acts of Beneficence, would be a pretty Cement of Society
and Virtue. It is the ordinary Foundation for Mens holding a Commerce
with each other, and becoming familiar, that they agree in the same sort
of Pleasure; and sure it may also be some Reason for Amity, that they
are under one common Distress. If all the Rich who are lame in the Gout,
from a Life of Ease, Pleasure, and Luxury, would help those few who have
it without a previous Life of Pleasure, and add a few of such laborious
Men, who are become lame from unhappy Blows, Falls, or other Accidents
of Age or Sickness; I say, would such gouty Persons administer to the
Necessities of Men disabled like themselves, the Consciousness of such a
Behaviour would be the best Julep, Cordial, and Anodine in the feverish,
faint and tormenting Vicissitudes of that miserable Distemper. The same
may be said of all other, both bodily and intellectual Evils. These
Classes of Charity would certainly bring down Blessings upon an Age and
People; and if Men were not petrifyed with the Love of this World,
against all Sense of the Commerce which ought to be among them, it would
not be an unreasonable Bill for a poor Man in the Agony of Pain,
aggravated by Want and Poverty, to draw upon a sick Alderman after this
Form;

<blockquote><i>Mr</i>. Basil Plenty,<br>
<br>
  <i><b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  <i>You have the Gout and Stone, with Sixty thousand Pound Sterling; I
  have the Gout and Stone, not worth one Farthing; I shall pray for you,
  and de<b>Sir</b> e you would pay the Bearer Twenty Shillings for Value

<br>
  <b>Sir</b> ,<br>
  Your humble Servant,<br>

The Reader's own Imagination will suggest to him the Reasonableness of
such Correspondence; and diversify them into a thousand Forms; but I
shall close this as I began upon the Subject of Blindness. The following
Letter seems to be written by a Man of Learning, who is returned to his
Study after a Suspence of an Ability to do so. The Benefit he reports
himself to have received, may well claim the handsomest Encomium he can
give the Operator.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote><i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'Ruminating lately on your admirable Discourses on the <i>Pleasures of
  the Imagination</i>, I began to consider to which of our Senses we are
  obliged for the greatest and most important Share of those Pleasures;
  and I soon concluded that it was to the <i>Sight</i>: That is the Sovereign
  of the Senses, and Mother of all the Arts and Sciences, that have
  refined the Rudeness of the uncultivated Mind to a Politeness that
  distinguishes the fine Spirits from the barbarous <i>Go&ucirc;t</i> of the
  <i>great</i> Vulgar and the <i>small</i>. The Sight is the obliging
  Benefactress, that bestows on us the most transporting Sensations that
  we have from the various and wonderful Products of Nature. To the
  Sight we owe the amazing Discoveries of the Height, Magnitude, and
  Motion of the Planets; their several Revolutions about their common
  Centre of Light, Heat, and Motion, the <i>Sun</i>. The <i>Sight</i> travels yet
  farther to the fixed Stars, and furnishes the Understanding with solid
  Reasons to prove, that each of them is a <i>Sun</i> moving on its own Axis
  in the Centre of its own Vortex or Turbillion, and performing the same
  Offices to its dependant Planets, that our glorious Sun does to this.
  But the Enquiries of the <i>Sight</i> will not be stopped here, but make
  their Progress through the immense Expanse to the <i>Milky Way</i>, and
  there divide the blended Fires of the <i>Galaxy</i> into infinite and
  different Worlds, made up of distinct Suns, and their peculiar
  Equipages of Planets, till unable to pursue this Track any farther, it
  deputes the Imagination to go on to new Discoveries, till it fill the
  unbounded Space with endless Worlds.<br>
<br>
  The <i>Sight</i> informs the Statuary's Chizel with Power to give Breath to
  lifeless Brass and Marble, and the Painter's Pencil to swell the flat
  Canvas with moving Figures actuated by imaginary Souls. Musick indeed
  may plead another Original, since <i>Jubal</i>, by the different Falls of
  his Hammer on the Anvil, discovered by the Ear the first rude Musick
  that pleasd the Antediluvian Fathers; but then the <i>Sight</i> has not
  only reduced those wilder Sounds into artful Order and Harmony, but
  conveys that Harmony to the most distant Parts of the World without
  the Help of Sound. To the <i>Sight</i> we owe not only all the Discoveries
  of Philosophy, but all the Divine Imagery of Poetry that transports
  the intelligent Reader of <i>Homer</i>, <i>Milton</i>, and <i>Virgil</i>.<br>
<br>
  As the Sight has polished the World, so does it supply us with the
  most grateful and lasting Pleasure. Let Love, let Friendship, paternal
  Affection, filial Piety, and conjugal Duty, declare the Joys the
  <i>Sight</i> bestows on a Meeting after Absence. But it would be endless to
  enumerate all the Pleasures and Advantages of <i>Sight;</i> every one that
  has it, every Hour he makes use of it, finds them, feels them, enjoys
  them.<br>
<br>
  Thus as our greatest Pleasures and Knowledge are derived from the
  Sight, so has Providence been more curious in the Formation of its
  Seat, the Eye, than of the Organs of the other Senses. That stupendous
  Machine is compos'd in a wonderful Manner of Muscles, Membranes, and
  Humours. Its Motions are admirably directed by the Muscles; the
  Perspicuity of the Humours transmit the Rays of Light; the Rays are
  regularly refracted by their Figure, the black Lining of the Sclerotes
  effectually prevents their being confounded by Reflection. It is
  wonderful indeed to consider how many Objects the Eye is fitted to
  take in at once, and successively in an Instant, and at the same time
  to make a Judgment of their Position, Figure, or Colour. It watches
  against our Dangers, guides our Steps, and lets in all the visible
  Objects, whose Beauty and Variety instruct and delight.<br>
<br>
  The Pleasures and Advantages of Sight being so great, the Loss must be
  very grievous; of which <i>Milton</i>, from Experience, gives the most
  sensible Idea, both in the third Book of his <i>Paradise Lost</i>, and in
  his <i>Sampson Agonistes</i>.<br>
<br>
To Light in the former.

       <blockquote><i>&mdash;Thee I revisit safe,<br>
And feel thy sovereign vital Lamp; but thou<br>
Revisit'st not these Eyes, that roul in vain<br>
To find thy piercing Ray, but find no Dawn.</i></blockquote>


       And a little after,

<blockquote><i>Seasons return, but not to me returns<br>
Day, or the sweet Approach of Ev'n and Morn,<br>
Or Sight of vernal Bloom, or Summer's Rose,<br>
Or Flocks or Herds, or human Face divine;<br>
But Cloud instead, and ever-during Dark<br>
Surround me: From the chearful Ways of Men<br>
Cut off, and for the Book of Knowledge fair,<br>
Presented&mdash;with an universal Blank<br>
Of Nature's Works, to me expung'd and raz'd,<br>
And Wisdom at one Entrance quite shut out.</i></blockquote>


       Again, in <i>Sampson Agonistes</i>.

<blockquote><i>&mdash;But Chief of all,<br>
O Loss of Sight! of thee I most complain;<br>
Blind among Enemies! O worse than Chains,<br>
Dungeon, or Beggary, or decrepid Age!<br>
Light, the prime Work of God, to me extinct,<br>
And all her various Objects of Delight<br>
Annull'd&mdash;<br><br>

  The Enjoyment of Sight then being so great a Blessing, and the Loss of
  it so terrible an Evil, how excellent and valuable is the Skill of
  that Artist which can restore the former, and redress the latter? My
  frequent Perusal of the Advertisements in the publick News-Papers
  (generally the most agreeable Entertainment they afford) has presented
  me with many and various Benefits of this kind done to my Countrymen
  by that skilful Artist Dr. <i>Grant</i>, Her Majesty's Oculist
  Extraordinary, whose happy Hand has brought and restored to Sight
  several Hundreds in less than Four Years. Many <a name="fr4721">have</a> received Sight by
  his Means, who came blind from their Mother's Womb, as in the famous
  Instance of <i>Jones</i> of <i>Newington</i><a href="#f4721"><sup>1</sup></a>. I my self have been cured by
  him of a Weakness in my Eyes next to Blindness, and am ready to
  believe any thing that is reported of his Ability this way; and know
  that many, who could not purchase his Assistance with Money, have
  enjoy'd it from his Charity. But a List of Particulars would swell my
  Letter beyond its Bounds, what I have said being sufficient to comfort
  those who are in the like Distress, since they may conceive Hopes of
  being no longer miserable in this Kind, while there is yet alive so
  able an Oculist as Dr. Grant.<br>

  To the SPECTATOR.<br>
<br>
  <i><b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  I am now in the Country, and employ most of my Time in reading, or
  thinking upon what I have read. Your paper comes constantly down to
  me, and it affects me so much, that I find my Thoughts run into your
  Way; and I recommend to you a Subject upon which you have not yet
  touched, and that is the Satisfaction some Men seem to take in their
  Imperfections, I think one may call it glorying in their
  Insufficiency; a certain great Author is of Opinion it is the contrary
  to Envy, tho perhaps it may proceed from it. Nothing is so common, as
  to hear Men of this Sort, speaking of themselves, add to their own
  Merit (as they think) by impairing it, in praising themselves for
  their Defects, freely allowing they commit some few frivolous Errors,
  in order to be esteemed persons of uncommon Talents and great
  Qualifications. They are generally professing an injudicious Neglect
  of Dancing, Fencing and Riding, as also an unjust Contempt for
  Travelling and the Modern Languages; as for their Part (say they) they
  never valued or troubled their Head about them. This panegyrical Satyr
  on themselves certainly is worthy of your Animadversion. I have known
  one of these Gentlemen think himself obliged to forget the Day of an
  Appointment, and sometimes even that you spoke to him; and when you
  see em, they hope youll pardon 'em, for they have the worst Memory in
  the World. One of em started up tother Day in some Confusion, and
  said, Now I think on't, I'm to meet Mr. <i>Mortmain</i> the Attorney about
  some Business, but whether it is to Day or to Morrow, faith, I can't
  tell. Now to my certain Knowledge he knew his Time to a Moment, and
  was there accordingly. These forgetful Persons have, to heighten their
  Crime, generally the best Memories of any People, as I have found out
  by their remembring sometimes through Inadvertency. Two or three of em
  that I know can say most of our modern Tragedies by Heart. I asked a
  Gentleman the other Day that is famous for a Good Carver, (at which
  Acquisition he is out of Countenance, imagining it may detract from
  some of his more essential Qualifications) to help me to something
  that was near him; but he excused himself, and blushing told me, Of
  all things he could never carve in his Life; though it can be proved
  upon him, that he cuts up, disjoints, and uncases with incomparable
  Dexterity. I would not be understood as if I thought it laudable for a
  Man of Quality and Fortune to rival the Aquisitions of Artificers, and
  endeavour to excel in little handy Qualities; No, I argue only against
  being ashamed at what is really Praiseworthy. As these Pretences to
  Ingenuity shew themselves several Ways, you'll often see a Man of this
  Temper ashamed to be clean, and setting up for Wit only from
  Negligence in his Habit. Now I am upon this Head, I can't help
  observing also upon a very different Folly proceeding from the same
  Cause. As these above-mentioned arise from affecting an Equality with
  Men of greater Talents from having the same Faults, there are others
  who would come at a Parallel with those above them, by possessing
  little Advantages which they want. I heard a young Man not long ago,
  who has sense, comfort himself in his Ignorance of <i>Greek</i>, <i>Hebrew</i>, and
  the <i>Orientals</i>: At the same Time that he published his Aversion to
  those Languages, he said that the Knowledge of 'em was rather a
  Diminution than an Advancement of a Man's Character: tho' at the same
  Time I know he languishes and repines he is not Master of them
  himself. Whenever I take any of these fine Persons, thus detracting
  from what they don't understand, I tell them I will complain to you,
  and say I am sure you will not allow it an Exception against a thing,
  that he who contemns it is an Ignorant in it.<br>

  I am a Man of a very good Estate, and am honourably in Love. I hope
  you will allow, when the ultimate Purpose is honest, there may be,
  without Trespass against Innocence, some Toying by the Way. People of
  Condition are perhaps too distant and formal on those Occasions; but,
  however that is, I am to confess to you, that I have writ some Verses
  to atone for my Offence. You profess'd Authors are a little severe
  upon us, who write like Gentlemen: But if you are a Friend to Love,
  you will insert my Poem. You cannot imagine how much Service it will
  do me with my Fair one, as well as Reputation with all my Friends, to
  have something of mine in the <i>Spectator</i>. My Crime was, that I
  snatch'd a Kiss, and my Poetical Excuse as follows:<br>

<a name="ded1"></a><h2>Dedication of the Seventh Volume of <i>The Spectator</i></h2><br>

<i><a name="frd1">To</a> Mr Methuen<a href="#fd1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</i><br>
<br>
<b>Sir</b> <br>
<br>
It is with very great Pleasure I take an Opportunity of publishing the
Gratitude I owe You, for the Place You allow me in your Friendship and
Familiarity. I will not acknowledge to You that I have often had You in
my Thoughts, when I have endeavoured to Draw, in some Parts of these
Discourses, the Character of a Good-natured, Honest, and Accomplished
Gentleman. But such Representations give my Reader an Idea of a Person
blameless only, or only laudable for such Perfections as extend no
farther than to his own private Advantage and Reputation.<br>
<br>
But when I speak of You, I Celebrate One who has had the Happiness of
Possessing also those Qualities which make a Man useful to Society, and
of having had Opportunities of Exerting them in the most Conspicuous
Manner.<br>
<br>
The Great Part You had, as <i>British</i> Embassador, in Procuring and
Cultivating the Advantageous Commerce between the Courts of <i>England</i>
and <i>Portugal</i>, has purchased you the lasting Esteem of all who
understand the Interest of either Nation.<br>
<br>
Those Personal Excellencies which are overrated by the ordinary World,
and too much neglected by Wise Men, You have applied with the justest
Skill and Judgment. The most graceful Address in Horsemanship, in the
Use of the Sword, and in Dancing, has been employed by You as lower
Arts, and as they have occasionally served to recover, or introduce the
Talents of a skilful Minister.<br>
<br>
But your Abilities have not appear'd only in one Nation. When it was
your Province to Act as Her Majesty's Minister at the Court of <i>Savoy</i>,
at that time encamped, You accompanied that Gallant Prince thro' all the
Vicissitudes of his Fortune, and shared, by His Side, the Dangers of
that Glorious Day in which He recovered His Capital. As far as it
regards Personal Qualities, You attained, in that one Hour, the highest
Military Reputation. The Behaviour of our Minister in the Action, and
the good Offices done the Vanquished in the Name of the Queen of
<i>England</i>, gave both the Conqueror and the Captive the most lively
Examples of the Courage and Generosity of the Nation He represented.<br>
<br>
Your Friends and Companions in your Absence frequently talk these things
of You, and You cannot hide from us, (by the most discreet Silence in
any Thing which regards Your self) that the frank Entertainment we have
at your Table, your easie Condescension in little Incidents of Mirth and
Diversion, and general Complacency of Manners, are far from being the
greatest Obligations we have to You. I do assure You there is not one of
your Friends has a Greater Sense of your Merit in general, and of the
Favours You every Day do us, than,<br>
<br>
<b>Sir</b> ,<br>
Your most Obedient, and<br>
most Humble Servant,<br>

Brackley, and forty-two years old, was a lawyer who had distinguished
himself as a diplomatist at the Court of Lisbon in 1703, and arranged
the very short commercial treaty between Great Britain and Portugal which
bears his name. Methuen then represented England at the Court of the
Duke of Savory, who deserted the French cause at the end of 1602, and
the ambassador proved his courage also as a combatant when he took part
in the defence and rescue of Turin from the French in 1706. After his
return to England Paul Methuen was made (in 1709) a Commissioner of the
Admirality. In the year 1713 he first sat in Parliament as member of
Brackley. He held afterwards various offices in the States, as those of
Commissioner of the Treasury, Comptroller of the Household, Treasurer of
the Household, Commissioner for inspecting the Law, was made <b>Sir</b>  Paul
Methuen, Knight of the Bath, and attained his highest dignity as Lord
Chancellor of Ireland before his death in 1757, at the age of 86. The
seventh volume, to which this Dedication is prefixed, is the last of the
original <i>Spectator</i>. With the eighth volume, representing an unsuccessful
attempt made to revive it, some time after its demise, Steele had
nothing to do, and that volume is not inscribed to any living person.<br>

<br>
  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  Being of the Number of those that have lately retired from the Center
  of Business and Pleasure, my Uneasiness in the Country where I am,
  arises rather from the Society than the Solitude of it. To be obliged
  to receive and return Visits from and to a Circle of Neighbours, who
  through Diversity of Age or Inclinations, can neither be entertaining
  or serviceable to us, is a vile Loss of Time, and a Slavery from which
  a Man should deliver himself, if possible: For why must I lose the
  remaining part of my Life, because they have thrown away the former
  Part of theirs? It is to me an insupportable Affliction, to be
  tormented with the Narrations of a Set of People, who are warm in
  their Expressions of the quick Relish of that Pleasure which their
  Dogs and Horses have a more delicate Taste of. I do also in my Heart
  detest and abhor that damnable Doctrine and Position of the Necessity
  of a Bumper, though to one's own Toast; for though 'tis pretended that
  these deep Politicians are used only to inspire Gaiety, they certainly
  drown that Chearfulness which would survive a moderate Circulation. If
  at these Meetings it were left to every Stranger either to fill his
  Glass according to his own Inclination, or to make his Retreat when he
  finds he has been sufficiently obedient to that of others, these
  Entertainments would be governed with more good Sense, and
  consequently with more good Breeding, than at present they are. Indeed
  where any of the Guests are known to measure their Fame or Pleasure by
  their Glass, proper Exhortations might be used to these to push their
  Fortunes in this sort of Reputation; but where 'tis unseasonably
  insisted on to a modest Stranger, this Drench may be said to be
  swallowed with <a name="fr4741">the</a> same Necessity, as if it had been tendered in the
  Horn<a href="#f4741"><sup>1</sup></a> for that purpose, with this aggravating Circumstance, that it
  distresses the Entertainer's Guest in the same degree as it relieves
  his Horses.<br>
<br>
  To attend without Impatience an Account of five-barr'd Gates, double
  Ditches, and Precipices, and to survey the Orator with de<b>Sir</b> ing Eyes,
  is to me extremely difficult, but absolutely necessary, to be upon
  tolerable Terms with him: but then the occasional Burstings out into
  Laughter, is of all other Accomplishments the most requisite. I
  confess at present I have not that command of these Convulsions, as is
  necessary to be good Company; therefore I beg you would publish this
  Letter, and let me be known all at once for a queer Fellow, and
  avoided. It is monstrous to me, that we, who are given to Reading and
  calm Conversation, should ever be visited by these Roarers: But they
  think they themselves, as Neighbours, may come into our Rooms with the
  same Right, that they and their Dogs hunt in our Grounds.<br>
<br>
  Your Institution of Clubs I have always admir'd, in which you
  constantly endeavoured the Union of the metaphorically Defunct, that
  is such as are neither serviceable to the Busy and Enterprizing part
  of Mankind, nor entertaining to the Retir'd and Speculative. There
  should certainly therefore in each County be established a Club of the
  Persons whose Conversations I have described, who for their own
  private, as also the publick Emolument, should exclude, and be
  excluded all other Society. Their Attire should be the same with their
  Huntsmen's, and none should be admitted into this green
  Conversation-Piece, except he had broke his Collar-bone thrice. A
  broken Rib or two might also admit a Man without the least Opposition.
  The President must necessarily have broken his Neck, and have been
  taken up dead once or twice: For the more Maims this Brotherhood shall
  have met with, the easier will their Conversation flow and keep up;
  and when any one of these vigorous Invalids had finished his Narration
  of the Collar-bone, this naturally would introduce the History of the
  Ribs. Besides, the different Circumstances of their Falls and
  Fractures would help to prolong and diversify their Relations. There
  should also be another Club of such Men, who have not succeeded so
  well in maiming themselves, but are however in the constant Pursuit of
  these Accomplishments. I would by no means be suspected by what I have
  said to traduce in general the Body of Fox-hunters; for whilst I look
  upon a reasonable Creature full-speed after a Pack of Dogs, by way of
  Pleasure, and not of Business, I shall always make honourable mention
  of it.<br>
<br>
  But the most irksome Conversation of all others I have met with in the
  Neighbourhood, has been among two or three of your Travellers, who
  have overlooked Men and Manners, and have passed through <i>France</i>and
  <i>Italy</i>with the same Observation that the Carriers and Stage-Coachmen
  do through <i>Great-Britain;</i>that is, their Stops and Stages have been
  regulated according to the Liquor they have met with in their Passage.
  They indeed remember the Names of abundance of Places, with the
  particular Fineries of certain Churches: But their distinguishing Mark
  is certain Prettinesses of Foreign Languages, the Meaning of which
  they could have better express'd in their own. The Entertainment of
  these fine Observers, <i>Shakespear</i><a name="fr4742">has</a> described to consist

<blockquote><i>In talking of the Alps and Appennines,<br>
The Pyrenean, and the River Po.</i><a href="#f4742"><sup>2</sup></a></blockquote>

  and then concludes with a Sigh,

<blockquote><i>Now this is worshipful Society!</i></blockquote>

  I would not be thought in all this to hate such honest Creatures as
  Dogs; I am only unhappy that I cannot partake in their Diversions. But
  I love them so well, as Dogs, that I often go with my Pockets stuffed
  with Bread to dispense my Favours, or make my way through them at
  Neighbours' Houses. There is in particular a young Hound of great
  Expectation, Vivacity, and Enterprize, that attends my Flights
  where-ever he spies me. This Creature observes my Countenance, and
  behaves himself accordingly. His Mirth, his Frolick, and Joy upon the
  Sight of me has been observed, and I have been gravely de<b>Sir</b> ed not to
  encourage him so much, for it spoils his Parts; but I think he shews
  them sufficiently in the several Boundings, Friskings, and Scourings,
  when he makes his Court to me: But I foresee in a little time he and I
  must keep Company with one another only, for we are fit for no other
  in these Parts. Having informd you how I do pass my time in the
  Country where I am, I must proceed to tell you how I would pass it,
  had I such a Fortune as would put me above the Observance of Ceremony
  and Custom.<br>
<br>
  My Scheme of a Country Life then should be as follows. As I am happy
  in three or four very agreeable Friends, these I would constantly have
  with me; and the Freedom we took with one another at School and the
  University, we would maintain and exert upon all Occasions with great
  Courage. There should be certain Hours of the Day to be employ'd in
  Reading, during which time it should be impossible for any one of us
  to enter the other's Chamber, unless by Storm. After this we would
  communicate the Trash or Treasure we had met with, with our own
  Reflections upon the Matter; the Justness of which we would controvert
  with good-humour'd Warmth, and never spare one another out of the
  complaisant Spirit of Conversation, which makes others affirm and deny
  the same matter in a quarter of an Hour. If any of the Neighbouring
  Gentlemen, not of our Turn, should take it in their heads to visit me,
  I should look upon these Persons in the same degree Enemies to my
  particular state of Happiness, as ever the French were to that of the
  Publick, and I would be at an annual Expence in Spies to observe their
  Motions. Whenever I should be surprized with a Visit, as I hate
  Drinking. I would be brisk in swilling Bumpers, upon this Maxim, That
  it is better to trouble others with my Impertinence, than to be
  troubled my self with theirs. The Necessity of an Infirmary makes me
  resolve to fall into that Project; and as we should be but Five, the
  Terrors of an involuntary Separation, which our Number cannot so well
  admit of, would make us exert our selves, in opposition to all the
  particulars mentioned in your Institution of that equitable
  Confinement. This my way of Life I know would subject me to the
  Imputation of a morose, covetous and singular Fellow. These and all
  other hard words, with all manner of insipid Jests, and all other
  Reproach, would be matter of Mirth to me and my Friends: Besides, I
  would destroy the Application of the Epithets Morose and Covetous, by
  a yearly Relief of my undeservedly necessitous Neighbours, and by
  treating my Friends and Domesticks with an Humanity that should
  express the Obligation to lie rather on my side; and for the word
  Singular, I was always of opinion every Man must be so, to be what one
  would de<b>Sir</b> e him.<br>

  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  About two Years ago I was called upon by the younger part of a Country
  Family, <a name="fr4744">by</a> my Mother's side related to me, to visit Mr. <i>Campbell</i>,
  the dumb Man<a href="#f4744"><sup>4</sup></a>; for they told me that that was chiefly what brought
  them to Town, having heard Wonders of him in <i>Essex</i>. I, who always
  wanted Faith in Matters of that kind, was not easily prevailed on to
  go; but lest they should take it ill, I went with them; when to my
  surprize, Mr. <i>Campbell</i> related all their past Life, (in short, had
  he not been prevented, such a Discovery would have come out, as would
  have ruined the next design of their coming to Town, <i>viz</i>. buying
  Wedding-Cloaths.) Our Names&mdash;though he never heard of us before&mdash;and
  we endeavoured to conceal&mdash;were as familiar to him as to our selves.
  To be sure, <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR, he is a very learned and wise Man. Being
  impatient to know my Fortune, having paid my respects in a
  Family-<i>Jacobus</i>, he told me (after his manner) among several other
  things, that in a Year and nine Months I should fall ill of a new
  Fever, be given over by my Physicians, but should with much difficulty
  recover: That the first time I took the Air afterwards, I should be
  address'd to by a young Gentleman of a plentiful Fortune, good Sense,
  and a generous Spirit. <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR, he is the purest Man in the
  World, for all he said is come to pass, and I am the happiest She in
  <i>Kent</i>. I have been in quest of Mr. <i>Campbell</i> these three Months, and
  cannot find him out. Now hearing you are a dumb Man too, I thought you
  might correspond, and be able to tell me something; for I think my
  self highly oblig'd to make his Fortune, as he has mine. 'Tis very
  possible your Worship, who has Spies all over this Town, can inform me
  how to send to him: If you can, I Beseech you be as speedy as
  possible, and you will highly oblige<br>

It is an old Observation, which has been made of Politicians who would
rather ingratiate themselves with their Sovereign, than promote his real
Service, that they accommodate their Counsels to his Inclinations, and
advise him to such Actions only as his Heart is naturally set upon. The
Privy-Counsellor of one in Love must observe the same Conduct, unless he
would forfeit the Friendship of the Person who de<b>Sir</b> es his Advice. I
have known several odd Cases of this Nature. <i>Hipparchus</i> was going to
marry a common Woman, but being resolved to do nothing without the
Advice of his Friend <i>Philander</i>, he consulted him upon the Occasion.
<i>Philander</i> told him his Mind freely, and represented his Mistress to
him in such strong Colours, that the next Morning he received a
Challenge for his Pains, and before Twelve a Clock was run through the
Body by the Man who had asked his Advice. <i>Celia</i> was more prudent on
the like occasion; she de<b>Sir</b> ed <i>Leonilla</i> to give her Opinion freely
upon a young Fellow who made his Addresses to her. <i>Leonilla</i>, to oblige
her, told her with great Frankness, that, she looked upon him as one of
the most worthless&mdash;<i>Celia</i>, foreseeing what a Character she was to
expect, begged her not to go on, for that she had been privately married
to him above a Fortnight. The truth of it is, a Woman seldom asks Advice
before she has bought her Wedding-Cloaths. When she has made her own
Choice, for Form's sake she sends a <i>Cong&eacute; d'elire</i> to her Friends.<br>
<br>
If we look into the secret Springs and Motives that set People at work
in these Occasions, and put them upon asking Advice, which they never
intend to take; I look upon it to be none of the least, that they are
incapable of keeping a Secret which is so very pleasing to them. A Girl
longs to tell her Confident, that she hopes to be married in a little
time, and, in order to talk of the pretty Fellow that dwells so much in
her Thoughts, asks her very gravely, what she would advise her to do in
a case of so much Difficulty. Why else should <i>Melissa</i>, who had not a
Thousand Pound in the World, go into every Quarter of the Town to ask
her Acquaintance whether they would advise her to take <i>Tom Townly</i>,
that made his Addresses to her with an Estate of Five Thousand a Year?
'Tis very pleasant on this occasion, to hear the Lady propose her
Doubts, and to see the Pains she is at to get over them.<br>
<br>
I must not here omit a Practice that is in use among the vainer Part of
our own Sex, who will often ask a Friend's Advice, in relation to a
Fortune whom they are never likely to come at. <b>Will. Honeycomb</b>, who is
now on the Verge of Threescore, took me aside not long since, and asked
me in his most serious Look, whether I would advise him to marry my Lady
<i>Betty Single</i>, who, by the way, is one of the greatest Fortunes about
Town. I star'd him full in the Face upon so strange a Question; upon
which he immediately gave me an Inventory of her Jewels and Estate,
adding, that he was resolved to do nothing in a matter of such
Consequence without my Approbation. Finding he would have an Answer, I
told him, if he could get the Lady's Consent, he had mine. This is about
the Tenth Match which, to my knowledge, <b>Will</b>, has consulted his Friends
upon, without ever opening his Mind to the Party herself.<br>
<br>
I have been engaged in this Subject by the following Letter, which comes
to me from some notable young Female Scribe, who, by the Contents of it,
seems to have carried Matters so far, that she is ripe for asking
Advice; but as I would not lose her Good-Will, nor forfeit the
Reputation which I have with her for Wisdom, I shall only communicate
the Letter to the Publick, without returning any Answer to it.<br>
<br>

<blockquote>  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,

  Now, <b>Sir</b> , the thing is this: Mr. <i>Shapely</i> is the prettiest Gentleman
  about Town. He is very tall, but not too tall neither. He dances like
  a Angel. His Mouth is made I don't know how, but 'tis the prettiest
  that I ever saw in my Life. He is always laughing, for he has an
  infinite deal of Wit. If you did but see how he rolls his Stockins! He
  has a thousand pretty Fancies, and I am sure, if you saw him, you
  would like him. He is a very good Scholar, and can talk <i>Latin</i> as
  fast as <i>English</i>. I wish you could but see him dance. Now you must
  understand poor Mr. <i>Shapely</i> has no Estate; but how can he help that,
  you know? And yet my Friends are so unreasonable as to be always
  teazing me about him, because he has no Estate: but I am sure he has
  that that is better than an Estate; for he is a Good-natured,
  Ingenious, Modest, Civil, Tall, Well-bred, Handsome Man, and I am
  obliged to him for his Civilities ever since I saw him. I forgot to
  tell you that he has black Eyes, and looks upon me now and then as if
  he had tears in them. And yet my Friends are so unreasonable, that
  they would have me be uncivil to him. I have a good Portion which they
  cannot hinder me of, and I shall be fourteen on the 29th Day of
  <i>August</i> next, and am therefore willing to settle in the World as soon
  as I can, and so is Mr. <i>Shapely</i>. But every body I advise with here
  is poor Mr. <i>Shapely's</i> Enemy. I de<b>Sir</b> e therefore you will give me
  your Advice, for I know you are a wise Man; and if you advise me well,
  I am resolved to follow it. I heartily wish you could see him dance,
  and am,<br>

<i><b>Sir</b> ,<br>
Your most humble Servant,</i><br>
B. D.<br>

He loves your <i><b>Spectators</b></i> mightily.</blockquote>

<br>
Among my Daily-Papers which I bestow on the Publick, there are some
which are written with Regularity and Method, and others that run out
into the Wildness of those Compositions which go by the Names of
<i>Essays</i>. As for the first, I have the whole Scheme of the Discourse in
my Mind before I set Pen to Paper. In the other kind of Writing, it is
sufficient that I have several Thoughts on a Subject, without troubling
my self to range them in such order, that they may seem to grow out of
one another, and be disposed under the proper Heads. <i>Seneca</i> and
<i>Montaigne</i> are Patterns for Writing in this last kind, as <i>Tully</i> and
<i>Aristotle</i> excel in the other. When I read an Author of Genius who
writes without Method, I fancy myself in a Wood that abounds with a
great many noble Objects, rising among one another in the greatest
Confusion and Disorder. When I read a methodical Discourse, I am in a
regular Plantation, and can place my self in its several Centres, so as
to take a view of all the Lines and Walks that are struck from them. You
may ramble in the one a whole Day together, and every Moment discover
something or other that is new to you; but when you have done, you will
have but a confused imperfect Notion of the Place: In the other, your
Eye commands the whole Prospect, and gives you such an Idea of it, as is
not easily worn out of the Memory.<br>
<br>
Irregularity and want of Method are only supportable in Men of great
Learning or Genius, who are often too full to be exact, and therefore
chuse to throw down their Pearls in Heaps before the Reader, rather than
be at the Pains of stringing them.<br>
<br>
Method is of advantage to a Work, both in respect to the Writer and the
Reader. In regard to the first, it is a great help to his Invention.
When a Man has plann'd his Discourse, he finds a great many Thoughts
rising out of every Head, that do not offer themselves upon the general
Survey of a Subject. His Thoughts are at the same time more
intelligible, and better discover their Drift and Meaning, when they are
placed in their proper Lights, and follow one another in a regular
Series, than when they are thrown together without Order and Connexion.
There is always an Obscurity in Confusion, and the same Sentence that
would have enlightened the Reader in one part of a Discourse, perplexes
him in another. For the same reason likewise <a name="fr4761">every</a> Thought in a
methodical Discourse shews <span style="color: #663300;">it</span><a href="#f4761"><sup>1</sup></a>` self in its greatest Beauty, as the
several Figures in a piece of Painting receive new Grace from their
Disposition in the Picture. The Advantages of a Reader from a methodical
Discourse, are correspondent with those of the Writer. He comprehends
every thing easily, takes it in with Pleasure, and retains it long.<br>
<br>
Method is not less requisite in ordinary Conversation than in Writing,
provided a Man would talk to make himself understood. I, who hear a
thousand Coffee-house Debates every Day, am very sensible of this want
of Method in the Thoughts of my honest Countrymen. There is not one
Dispute in ten which is managed in those Schools of Politicks, where,
after the three first Sentences, the Question is not entirely lost. Our
Disputants put me in mind of the Cuttle-Fish, that when he is unable to
extricate himself, blackens all the Water about him till he becomes
invisible. The Man who does not know how to methodize his Thoughts, has
always, <a name="fr4762">to</a> borrow a Phrase from the Dispensary, <i>a barren Superfluity of
Words;</i><a href="#f4762"><sup>2</sup></a> the Fruit is lost amidst the Exuberance of Leaves.<br>
<br>
<i>Tom Puzzle</i> is one of the most Eminent Immethodical Disputants of any
that has fallen under my Observation. <i>Tom</i> has read enough to make him
very Impertinent; his Knowledge is sufficient to raise Doubts, but not
to clear them. It is pity that he has so much Learning, or that he has
not a great deal more. With these Qualifications <i>Tom</i> sets up for a
Free-thinker, finds a great many things to blame in the Constitution of
his Country, and gives shrewd Intimations that he does not believe
another World. In short, <i>Puzzle</i> is an Atheist as much as his Parts
will give him leave. He has got about half a dozen common-place Topicks,
into which he never fails to turn the Conversation, whatever was the
Occasion of it: Tho' the matter in debate be about <i>Doway</i> or <i>Denain</i>,
it is ten to one but half his Discourse runs upon the Unreasonableness
of Bigottry and Priest-craft. This makes Mr. <i>Puzzle</i> the Admiration of
all those who have less Sense than himself, and the Contempt of those
who have more. There is none in Town whom <i>Tom</i> dreads so much as my
Friend <i>Will Dry</i>. <i>Will</i>, who is acquainted with <i>Tom's</i> Logick, when
he finds him running off the Question, cuts him short with a <i>What then?
We allow all this to be true, but what is it to our present Purpose?</i> I
have known <i>Tom</i> eloquent half an hour together, and triumphing, as he
thought, in the Superiority of the Argument, when he has been non-plus'd
on a sudden by Mr. <i>Dry's</i> de<b>Sir</b> ing him to tell the Company what it was
that he endeavoured to prove. In short, <i>Dry</i> is a Man of a clear
methodical Head, but few Words, and gains the same Advantage over
<i>Puzzle</i>, that a small Body of regular Troops would gain over a
numberless undisciplined Militia.<br>

<br>
  <i><b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  Having lately read your Essay on the Pleasures of the Imagination, I
  was so taken with your Thoughts upon some of our <i>English</i> Gardens,
  that I cannot forbear troubling you with a Letter upon that Subject. I
  am one, you must know, who am looked upon as an Humorist in Gardening.
  I have several Acres about my House, which I call my Garden, and which
  a skilful Gardener would not know what to call. It is a Confusion of
  Kitchin and Parterre, Orchard and Flower-Garden, which lie so mixt and
  interwoven with one another, that if a Foreigner who had seen nothing
  of our Country should be convey'd into my Garden at his first landing,
  he would look upon it as a natural Wilderness, and one of the
  uncultivated Parts of our Country. My Flowers grow up in several Parts
  of the Garden in the greatest Luxuriancy and Profusion. I am so far
  from being fond of any particular one, by reason of its Rarity, that
  if I meet with any one in a Field which pleases me, I give it a place
  in my Garden. By this means, when a Stranger walks with me, he is
  surprized to see several large Spots of Ground cover'd with ten
  thousand different Colours, and has often singled out Flowers that he
  might have met with under a common Hedge, in a Field, or in a Meadow,
  as some of the greatest Beauties of the Place. The only Method I
  observe in this Particular, is to range in the same Quarter the
  Products of the same Season, that they may make their Appearance
  together, and compose a Picture of the greatest Variety. There is the
  same Irregularity in my Plantations, which run into as great a
  Wildness as their Natures will permit. I take in none that do not
  naturally rejoice in the Soil, and am pleased when I am walking in a
  Labyrinth of my own raising, not to know whether the next Tree I shall
  meet with is an Apple or an Oak, an Elm or a Pear-Tree. My Kitchin has
  likewise its particular Quarters assigned it; for besides the
  wholesome Luxury which that Place abounds with, I have always thought
  a Kitchin-Garden a more pleasant Sight than the finest Orangery, or
  artificial Greenhouse. I love to see everything in its Perfection, and
  am more pleased to survey my Rows of Coleworts and Cabbages, with a
  thousand nameless Pot-herbs, springing up in their full Fragrancy and
  Verdure, than to see the tender Plants of Foreign Countries kept alive
  by artificial Heats, or withering in an Air and Soil that are not
  adapted to them. I must not omit, that there is a Fountain rising in
  the upper part of my Garden, which forms a little wandring Rill, and
  administers to the Pleasure as well as the Plenty of the Place. I have
  so conducted it, that it visits most of my Plantations; and have taken
  particular Care to let it run in the same manner as it would do in an
  open Field, so that it generally passes through Banks of Violets and
  Primroses, Plats of Willow, or other Plants, that seem to be of its
  own producing. There is another Circumstance in which I am very
  particular, or, as my Neighbours call me, very whimsical: As my Garden
  invites into it all the Birds of the Country, by offering them the
  Conveniency of Springs and Shades, Solitude and Shelter, I do not
  suffer any one to destroy their Nests in the Spring, or drive them
  from their usual Haunts in Fruit-time. I value my Garden more for
  being full of Blackbirds than Cherries, and very frankly give them
  Fruit for their Songs. By this means I have always the Musick of the
  Season in its Perfection, and am highly delighted to see the Jay or
  the Thrush hopping about my Walks, and shooting before my Eye across
  the several little Glades and Alleys that I pass thro'. I think there
  are as many kinds of Gardening as of Poetry: Your Makers of Parterres
  and Flower-Gardens, are Epigrammatists and Sonneteers in this Art:
  Contrivers of Bowers and Grotto's, Treillages and Cascades, are
  Romance Writers. <i>Wise</i> and <i>London</i> are our heroick Poets; and if, as
  a Critick, I may single out any Passage of their Works to commend, I
  shall take notice of that Part in the upper Garden at <i>Kensington</i>,
  which was at first nothing but a Gravel-Pit. It must have been a fine
  Genius for Gardening, that could have thought of forming such an
  unsightly Hollow into so beautiful an Area, and to have hit the Eye
  with so uncommon and agreeable a Scene as that which it is now wrought
  into. To give this particular Spot of Ground the greater Effect, they
  have made a very pleasing Contrast; for as on one side of the Walk you
  see this hollow Basin, with its several little Plantations lying so
  conveniently under the Eye of the Beholder; on the other side of it
  there appears a seeming Mount, made up of Trees rising one higher than
  another in proportion as they approach the Center. A Spectator, who
  has not heard this Account of it, would think this Circular Mount was
  not only a real one, but that it had been actually scooped out of that
  hollow Space which I have before mention'd. I never yet met with any
  one who had walked in this Garden, who was not struck with that Part
  of it which I have here mention'd. As for my self, you will find, by
  the Account which I have already given you, that my Compositions in
  Gardening are altogether after the <i>Pindarick</i> Manner, and run into
  the beautiful Wildness of Nature, without affecting the nicer
  Elegancies of Art. What I am now going to mention, will, perhaps,
  deserve your Attention more than any thing I have yet said. I find
  that in the Discourse which I spoke of at the Beginning of my Letter,
  you are against filling an <i>English</i> Garden with Ever-Greens; and
  indeed I am so far of your Opinion, that I can by no means think the
  Verdure of an Ever-Green comparable to that which shoots out annually,
  and clothes our Trees in the Summer-Season. But I have often wonder'd
  that those who are like my self, and love to live in Gardens, have
  never thought of contriving a <i>Winter Garden</i>, which would consist of
  such Trees only as never cast their Leaves. We have very often little
  Snatches of Sunshine and fair Weather in the most uncomfortable Parts
  of the Year; and have frequently several Days in <i>November</i> and
  <i>January</i> that are as agreeable as any in the finest Months. At such
  times, therefore, I think there could not be a greater Pleasure, than
  to walk in such a <i>Winter-Garden</i> as I have proposed. In the
  Summer-Season the whole Country blooms, and is a kind of Garden, for
  which reason we are not so sensible of those Beauties that at this
  time may be every where met with; but when Nature is in her
  Desolation, and presents us with nothing but bleak and barren
  Prospects, there is something unspeakably chearful in a Spot of Ground
  which is covered with Trees that smile amidst all the Rigours of
  Winter, and give us a View of the most gay Season in the midst of that
  which is the most dead and melancholy. I have so far indulged my self
  in this Thought, that I have set apart a whole Acre of Ground for the
  executing of it. The Walls are covered with Ivy instead of Vines. The
  Laurel, the Hornbeam, and the Holly, with many other Trees and Plants
  of the same nature, grow so thick in it, that you cannot imagine a
  more lively Scene. The glowing Redness of the Berries, with which they
  are hung at this time, vies with the Verdure of their Leaves, and are
  <a name="fr4771">apt</a> to inspire the Heart of the Beholder with that vernal Delight
  which you have somewhere taken notice of in your former papers<a href="#f4771"><sup>1</sup></a>. It
  is very pleasant, at the same time, to see the several kinds of Birds
  retiring into this little Green Spot, and enjoying themselves among
  the Branches and Foliage, when my great Garden, which I have before
  mention'd to you, does not afford a single Leaf for their Shelter.<br>
<br>
  You must know, <b>Sir</b> , that I look upon the Pleasure which we take in a
  Garden, as one of the most innocent Delights in Human Life. A Garden
  was the Habitation of our first Parents before the Fall. It is
  naturally apt to fill the Mind with Calmness and Tranquillity, and to
  lay all its turbulent Passions at rest. It gives us a great insight
  into the Contrivance and Wisdom of Providence, and suggests
  innumerable Subjects for Meditation. I cannot but think the very
  Complacency and Satisfaction which a Man takes in these Works of
  Nature, to be a laudable, if not a virtuous Habit of Mind. For all
  which Reasons I hope you will pardon the Length of my present Letter.
  <i>I am,</i><br>

  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  It happened lately, that a Friend of mine, who had many things to buy
  for his Family, would oblige me to walk with him to the Shops. He was
  very nice in his way, and fond of having every thing shewn, which at
  first made me very uneasy; but as his Humour still continu'd, the
  things which I had been staring at along with him, began to fill my
  Head, and led me into a Set of amusing Thoughts concerning them.<br>
<br>
  I fancied it must be very surprizing to any one who enters into a
  detail of Fashions, to consider how far the Vanity of Mankind has laid
  it self out in Dress, what a prodigious number of People it maintains,
  and what a Circulation of Money it occasions. Providence in this Case
  makes use of the Folly which we will not give up, and it becomes
  instrumental to the Support of those who are willing to labour. Hence
  it is that Fringe-Makers, Lace-Men, Tire-Women, and a number of other
  Trades, which would be useless in a simple State of Nature, draw their
  Subsistence; tho' it is seldom seen that such as these are extremely
  rich, because their original Fault of being founded upon Vanity, keeps
  them poor by the light Inconstancy of its Nature. The Variableness of
  Fashion turns the Stream of Business which flows from it now into one
  Channel, and anon into another; so that different Sets of People sink
  or flourish in their turns by it.<br>
<br>
  From the Shops we retir'd to the Tavern, where I found my Friend
  express so much satisfaction for the Bargains he had made, that my
  moral Reflections, (if I had told them) might have pass'd for a
  Reproof; so I chose rather to fall in with him, and let the Discourse
  run upon the use of Fashions.<br>
<br>
  Here we remembred how much Man is govern'd by his Senses, how lively
  he is struck by the Objects which appear to him in an agreeable
  manner, how much Clothes contribute to make us agreeable Objects, and
  how much we owe it to our selves that we should appear so.<br>
<br>
  We considered Man as belonging to Societies; Societies as form'd of
  different Ranks; and different Ranks distinguished by Habits, that all
  proper Duty or Respect might attend their Appearance.<br>
<br>
  We took notice of several Advantages which are met with in the
  Occurrences of Conversation. How the bashful Man has been sometimes so
  rais'd, as to express himself with an Air of Freedom, when he imagines
  that his Habit introduces him to Company with a becoming Manner: And
  again, how a Fool in fine Clothes shall be suddenly heard with
  Attention, till he has betray'd himself; whereas a Man of Sense
  appearing with a Dress of Negligence, shall be but coldly received,
  till he be proved by Time, and established in a Character. Such things
  as these we cou'd recollect to have happen'd to our knowledge so very
  often, that we concluded the Author had his Reasons, who advises his
  Son to go in Dress rather above his Fortune than under it.<br>
<br>
  At last the Subject seem'd so considerable, that it was proposed to
  have a Repository built for Fashions, as there are Chambers for Medals
  and other Rarities. The Building may be shap'd as that which stands
  among the Pyramids, in the Form of a Woman's Head. This may be rais'd
  upon Pillars, whose Ornaments shall bear a just relation to the
  Design. Thus there may be an Imitation of Fringe carv'd in the Base, a
  sort of Appearance of Lace in the Frieze, and a Representation of
  curling Locks, with Bows of Ribband sloping over them, may fill up the
  Work of the Cornish. The Inside may be divided into two Apartments
  appropriated to each Sex. The Apartments may be fill'd with Shelves,
  on which Boxes are to stand as regularly as Books in a Library. These
  are to have Folding-Doors, which being open'd, you are to behold a
  Baby dressed out in some Fashion which has flourish'd, and standing
  upon a Pedestal, where the time of its Reign is mark'd down. For its
  further Regulation, let it be order'd, that every one who invents a
  Fashion shall bring in his Box, whose Front he may at pleasure have
  either work'd or painted with some amorous or gay Device, that, like
  Books with gilded Leaves and Covers, it may the sooner draw the Eyes
  of the Beholders. And to the end that these may be preserv'd with all
  due Care, let there be a Keeper appointed, who shall be a Gentleman
  qualify'd with a competent Knowledge in Clothes; so that by this means
  the Place, will be a comfortable Support for some Beau who has spent
  his Estate in dressing.<br>
<br>
  The Reasons offer'd by which we expected to gain the Approbation of
  the Publick, were as follows.<br>
<br>
  First, That every one who is considerable enough to be a Mode, and has
  any Imperfection of Nature or Chance, which it is possible to hide by
  the Advantage of Clothes, may, by coming to this Repository, be
  furnish'd her self, and furnish all who are under the same Misfortune,
  with the most agreeable Manner of concealing it; and that on the other
  side, every one who has any Beauty in Face or Shape, may also be
  furnished with the most agreeable Manner of shewing it.<br><br>

  Secondly, That whereas some of our young Gentlemen who travel, give us
  great reason to suspect that they only go abroad to make or improve a
  Fancy for Dress, a Project of this nature may be a means to keep them
  at home, which is in effect the keeping of so much Money in the
  Kingdom. And perhaps the Balance of Fashion in <i>Europe</i>, which now
  leans upon the side of <i>France</i>, may be so alter'd for the future,
  that it may become as common with <i>Frenchmen</i> to come to <i>England</i> for
  their finishing Stroke of Breeding, as it has been for <i>Englishmen</i> to
  go to <i>France</i> for it.<br>
<br>
  Thirdly, Whereas several great Scholars, who might have been otherwise
  useful to the World, have spent their time in studying to describe the
  Dresses of the Ancients from dark Hints, which they are fain to
  interpret and support with much Learning, it will from henceforth
  happen, that they shall be freed from the Trouble, and the World from
  useless Volumes. This Project will be a Registry, to which Posterity
  may have recourse, for the clearing such obscure Passages as tend that
  way in Authors; and therefore we shall not for the future submit our
  selves to the Learning of Etymology, which might persuade the Age to
  come, that the Farthingal was worn for Cheapness, or the Furbeloe for
  Warmth.<br>
<br>
  Fourthly, Whereas they who are old themselves, have often a way of
  railing at the Extravagance of Youth, and the whole Age in which their
  Children live; it is hoped that this ill Humour will be much
  suppress'd, when we can have recourse to the Fashions of their Times,
  produce them in our Vindication, and be able to shew that it might
  have been as expensive in Queen <i>Elizabeth's</i> time only to wash and
  quill a Ruff, as it is now to buy Cravats or Neck-Handkerchiefs.<br>
<br>
  We de<b>Sir</b> e also to have it taken Notice of, That because we would shew
  a particular respect to Foreigners, which may induce them to perfect
  their Breeding here in a Knowledge which is very proper for pretty
  Gentlemen, we have conceived the Motto for the House in the Learned
  Language. There is to be a Picture over the Door, with a Looking-Glass
  and a Dressing-Chair in the Middle of it: Then on one side are to be
  seen, above one another, Patch-Boxes, Pin-Cushions, and little
  Bottles; on the other, Powder Baggs, Puffs, Combs and Brushes; beyond
  these, Swords with fine Knots, whose Points are hidden, and Fans
  almost closed, with the Handles downward, are to stand out
  interchangeably from the Sides till they meet at the Top, and form a
  Semicircle over the rest of the Figures: Beneath all, the Writing is
  to run in <a name="fr4781">this</a> pretty sounding Manner:

<blockquote><i>Adeste, O quotquot sunt, Veneres, Grati&aelig;, Cupidines<a href="#f4781"><sup>1</sup></a>,<br>
    En vobis adsunt in promptu<br>
    Faces, Vincula, Spicula,<br>
    Hinc eligite, sumite, regite.</i></blockquote>

I am, <b>Sir</b> ,<br>
  Your most humble Servant,<br>
  <i>A. B.</i></blockquote><br>

The Proposal of my Correspondent I cannot but look upon as an ingenious
Method of placing Persons (whose Parts make them ambitious to exert
themselves in frivolous things) in a Rank by themselves. In order to
this, I would propose, That there be a Board of Directors of the
fashionable Society; and because it is a Matter of too much Weight for a
private Man to determine alone, I should be highly obliged to my
Correspondents if they would give in Lists of Persons qualify'd for this
Trust. If the chief Coffee-houses, the Conversations of which Places are
carry'd on by Persons, each of whom has his little number of Followers
and Admirers, would name from among themselves two or three to be
inserted, they should be put up with great Faithfulness. Old Beaus are
to be presented in the first place; but as that Sect, with relation to
Dress, is almost extinct, it will, I fear, be absolutely necessary to
take in all Time-Servers, properly so deem'd; that is, such as, without
any Conviction of Conscience or View of Interest, change with the World,
and that merely from a Terror of being out of Fashion. Such also, who
from Facility of Temper, and too much Obsequiousness, are vicious
against their Will, and follow Leaders whom they do not approve, for
Want of Courage to go their own Way, are capable Persons for this
Superintendency. Those who are both to grow old, or would do any thing
contrary to the Course and Order of things, out of Fondness to be in
Fashion, are proper Candidates. To conclude, those who are in Fashion
without apparent Merit, must be supposed to have latent Qualities, which
would appear in a Post of Direction; and therefore are to be regarded in
forming these Lists. Any who shall be pleased, according to these, or
what further Qualifications may occur to himself, to send a List, is
de<b>Sir</b> ed to do it within fourteen days after this Date.<br>
<br>
<i>N. B. The Place of the Physician to this Society, according to the last
mentioned Qualification, is already engag'd.</i><br>

<br>

Many are the Epistles I every day receive from Husbands, who complain of
Vanity, Pride, but above all Ill-nature, in their Wives. I cannot tell
how it is, but I think I see in all their Letters that the Cause of
their Uneasiness is in themselves; and indeed I have hardly ever
observed the married Condition unhappy, but from want of Judgment or
Temper in the Man. The truth is, we generally make Love in a Style, and
with Sentiments very unfit for ordinary Life: They are half Theatrical,
half Romantick. By this Means we raise our Imaginations to what is not
to be expected in human Life; and because we did not beforehand think of
the Creature we were enamoured of as subject to Dishumour, Age,
Sickness, Impatience or Sullenness, but altogether considered her as the
Object of Joy, human Nature it self is often imputed to her as her
particular Imperfection or Defect.<br>
<br>
I take it to be a Rule proper to be observed in all Occurrences of Life,
but more especially in the domestick or matrimonial Part of it, to
preserve always a Disposition to be pleased. This cannot be supported
but by considering things in their right light, and as Nature has form'd
them, and not as our own Fancies or Appetites would have them. He then
who took a young Lady to his Bed, with no other Consideration than the
Expectation of Scenes of Dalliance, and thought of her (as I said
before) only as she was to administer to the Gratification of De<b>Sir</b> e; as
that De<b>Sir</b> e flags, will, without her Fault, think her Charms and her
Merit abated: From hence must follow Indifference, Dislike, Peevishness,
and Rage. But the Man who brings his Reason to support his Passion, and
beholds what he loves as liable to all the Calamities of human Life both
in Body and Mind, and even at the best what must bring upon him new
Cares and new Relations; such a Lover, I say, will form himself
accordingly, and adapt his Mind to the Nature of his Circumstances. This
latter Person will be prepared to be a Father, a Friend, an Advocate, a
Steward for People yet unborn, and has proper Affections ready for every
Incident in the Marriage State. Such a Man can hear the Cries of
Children with Pity instead of Anger; and when they run over his Head, he
is not disturb'd at their Noise, but is glad of their Mirth and Health.
<i>Tom Trusty</i> has told me, that he thinks it doubles his Attention to the
most intricate Affair he is about, to hear his Children, for whom all
his Cares are applied, make a Noise in the next Room: <a name="fr4791">On</a> the other side
<i>Will Sparkish</i> cannot put on his Perriwig, or adjust his Cravat at the
Glass, for the Noise of those damned Nurses and <span style="color: #663300;">squaling</span><a href="#f4791"><sup>1</sup></a> Brats; and
then ends with a gallant Reflection upon the Comforts of Matrimony, runs
out of the Hearing, and drives to the Chocolate-house.<br>
<br>
According as the Husband is dispos'd in himself, every Circumstance of
his Life is to give him Torment or Pleasure. When the Affection is
well-placed, and supported by the Considerations of Duty, Honour, and
Friendship, which are in the highest Degree engaged in this Alliance,
there can nothing rise in the common Course of Life, or from the Blows
or Favours of Fortune, in which a Man will not find Matters of some
Delight unknown to a single Condition.<br>
<br>
He who sincerely loves his Wife and Family, and studies to improve that
Affection in himself, conceives Pleasure from the most indifferent
things; while the married Man, who has not bid adieu to the Fashions and
false Gallantries of the Town, is perplexed with every thing around him.
In both these Cases Men cannot, indeed, make a sillier Figure, than in
repeating such Pleasures and Pains to the rest of the World; but I speak
of them only, as they sit upon those who are involved in them. As I
visit all sorts of People, I cannot indeed but smile, when the good Lady
tells her Husband what extraordinary things the Child spoke since he
went out. No longer than yesterday I was prevail'd with to go home with
a fond Husband: and his Wife told him, that his Son, of his own head,
when the Clock in the Parlour struck two, said, Pappa would come home to
Dinner presently. While the Father has him in a rapture in his Arms, and
is drowning him with Kisses, the Wife tells me he is but just four Years
old. Then they both struggle for him, and bring him up to me, and repeat
his Observation of two a-Clock. I was called upon, by Looks upon the
Child, and then at me, to say something; and I told the Father, that
this Remark of the Infant of his coming home, and joining the Time with
it, was a certain Indication that he would be a great Historian and
Chronologer. They are neither of them Fools, yet received my Compliment
with great Acknowledgment of my Prescience. I fared very well at Dinner,
and heard many other notable Sayings of their Heir, which would have
given very little Entertainment to one less turned to Reflection than I
was; but it was a pleasing Speculation to remark on the Happiness of a
Life, in which things of no Moment give Occasion of Hope,
Self-Satisfaction, and Triumph. On the other Hand, I have known an
ill-natur'd Coxcomb, who was hardly improved in any thing but Bulk, for
want of this Disposition, silence the whole Family, as a Set of silly
Women and Children, for recounting things which were really above his
own Capacity.<br>
<br>
When I say all this, I cannot deny but there are perverse Jades that
fall to Mens Lots, with whom it requires more than common Proficiency in
Philosophy to be able to live. When these are joined to Men of warm
Spirits, without Temper or Learning, they are frequently corrected with
Stripes; but one of our famous Lawyers is of Opinion, That this ought to
be used sparingly. <a name="fr4792">As</a> I remember, those are his very Words<a href="#f4792"><sup>2</sup></a>; but as
it is proper to draw some spiritual Use out of all Afflictions, I should
rather recommend to those who are visited with Women of Spirit, to form
themselves for the World by Patience at home. <i>Socrates</i>, who is by all
Accounts the undoubted Head of the Sect of the Hen-peck'd, own'd and
acknowledged that he ow'd great part of his Virtue to the Exercise which
his useful Wife constantly gave it. There are several good Instructions
may be drawn from his wise Answers to People of less Fortitude than
himself on her Subject. A Friend, with Indignation, asked how so good a
Man could live with so violent a Creature? <a name="fr4793">He</a> observ'd to him, <i>That
they who learn to keep a good Seat on horseback, mount the least
managable they can get, and when they have master'd them, they are sure
never to be discomposed on the Backs of Steeds less restive.</i><a href="#f4793"><sup>3</sup></a> At
several times, to different Persons, on the same Subject, he has said,
<i>My dear Friend, you are beholden to</i> Xantippe, <i>that I bear so well
your flying out in a Dispute.</i> To another, <i>My Hen clacks very much, but
she brings me Chickens. They that live in a trading Street, are not
disturbed at the Passage of Carts.</i> I would have, if possible, a wise
Man be contented with his Lot, even with a Shrew; for tho' he cannot
make her better, he may, you see, make himself better by her means.<br>
<br>
But instead of pursuing my Design of Displaying Conjugal Love in its
natural Beauties and Attractions, I am got into Tales to the
disadvantage of that State of Life. I must say, therefore, that I am
verily persuaded that whatever is delightful in human Life, is to be
enjoy'd in greater Perfection in the marry'd, than in the single
Condition. He that has this Passion in Perfection, in Occasions of Joy
can say to himself, besides his own Satisfaction, <i>How happy will this
make my Wife and Children?</i> Upon Occurrences of Distress or Danger can
comfort himself, <i>But, all this while my Wife and Children are safe</i>.
There is something in it that doubles Satisfactions, because others
participate them; and dispels Afflictions, because others are exempt
from them. All who are marry'd without this Relish of their
Circumstance, are in either a tasteless Indolence and Negligence, which
is hardly to be attain'd, or else live in the hourly Repetition of sharp
Answers, eager Upbraidings, and distracting Reproaches. In a word the
married State, with and without the Affection suitable to it, is the
compleatest Image of Heaven and Hell we are capable of receiving in this
Life.<br>

<br>

The other Day looking over those old Manuscripts, of which I have
formerly given some Account, and which relate to the Character of the
<a name="fr4801">mighty</a> <i>Pharamond</i> of <i>France</i>, and the close Friendship between him and
his Friend <i>Eucrate</i><a href="#f4801"><sup>1</sup></a>; I found, among the Letters which had been in
the custody of the latter, an Epistle from a Country Gentleman to
<i>Pharamond</i>, wherein he excuses himself from coming to Court. The
Gentleman, it seems, was contented with his Condition, had formerly been
in the King's Service, but at the writing the following Letter, had,
from Leisure and Reflection, quite another Sense of things than that
which he had in the more active Part of his Life.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <i>Monsieur</i> Chezluy <i>to</i> Pharamond.<br>
<br>
  <i>Dread <b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  I have from your own Hand (enclosed under the Cover of Mr. <i>Eucrate</i>
  of your Majesty's Bed-Chamber) a Letter which invites me to Court. I
  understand this great Honour to be done me out of Respect and
  Inclination to me, rather than Regard to your own Service: For which
  Reason I beg leave to lay before your Majesty my Reasons for declining
  to depart from Home; and will not doubt but, as your Motive in
  de<b>Sir</b> ing my Attendance was to make me an happier Man, when you think
  that will not be effected by my Remove, you will permit me to stay
  where I am. Those who have an Ambition to appear in Courts, have ever
  an Opinion that their Persons or their Talents are particularly formed
  for the Service or Ornament of that Place; or else are hurried by
  downright De<b>Sir</b> e of Gain, or what they call Honour, or take upon
  themselves whatever the Generosity of their Master can give them
  Opportunities to grasp at. But your Goodness shall not be thus imposed
  upon by me: I will therefore confess to you, that frequent Solitude,
  and long Conversation with such who know no Arts which polish Life,
  have made me the plainest Creature in your Dominions. Those less
  Capacities of moving with a good Grace, bearing a ready Affability to
  all around me, and acting with ease before many, have quite left me. I
  am come to that, with regard to my Person, that I consider it only as
  a Machine I am obliged to take Care of, in order to enjoy my Soul in
  its Faculties with Alacrity; well remembering, that this Habitation of
  Clay will in a few years be a meaner Piece of Earth than any Utensil
  about my House. When this is, as it really is, the most frequent
  Reflection I have, you will easily imagine how well I should become a
  Drawing-Room: Add to this, What shall a Man without De<b>Sir</b> es do about
  the generous <i>Pharamond</i>? Monsieur <i>Eucrate</i> has hinted to me, that
  you have thoughts of distinguishing me with Titles. As for my self, in
  the Temper of my present Mind, Appellations of Honour would but
  embarrass Discourse, and new Behaviour towards me perplex me in every
  Habitude of Life. I am also to acknowledge to you, that my Children,
  of whom your Majesty condescended to enquire, are all of them mean,
  both in their Persons and Genius. The Estate my eldest Son is Heir to,
  is more than he can enjoy with a good Grace. My Self-love will not
  carry me so far, as to impose upon Mankind the Advancement of Persons
  (merely for their being related to me) into high Distinctions, who
  ought for their own Sakes, as well as that of the Publick, to affect
  Obscurity. I wish, my generous Prince, as it is in your power to give
  Honours and Offices, it were also to give Talents suitable to them:
  Were it so, the noble <i>Pharamond</i> would reward the Zeal of my Youth
  with Abilities to do him Service in my Age.<br>
<br>
  'Those who accept of Favour without Merit, support themselves in it at
  the Expence of your Majesty. Give me Leave to tell you, <b>Sir</b> , this is
  the Reason that we in the Country hear so often repeated the Word
  <i>Prerogative</i>. That Part of your Law which is reserved in your self
  for the readier Service and Good of the Publick, slight Men are
  eternally buzzing in our Ears to cover their own Follies and
  Miscarriages. It would be an Addition to the high Favour you have done
  me, if you would let <i>Eucrate</i> send me word how often, and in what
  Cases you allow a Constable to insist upon the Prerogative. From the
  highest to the lowest Officer in your Dominions, something of their
  own Carriage they would exempt from Examination under the Shelter of
  the Word <i>Prerogative</i>. I would fain, most noble <i>Pharamond</i>, see one
  of your Officers assert your Prerogative by good and gracious Actions.
  When is it used to help the Afflicted, to rescue the Innocent, to
  comfort the Stranger? Uncommon Methods, apparently undertaken to
  attain worthy Ends, would never make Power invidious. You see, <b>Sir</b> , I
  talk to you with the Freedom your noble Nature approves, in all whom
  you admit to your Conversation.<br>
<br>
  'But, to return to your Majesty's Letter, I humbly conceive, that all
  Distinctions are useful to Men, only as they are to act in Publick;
  and it would be a romantick Madness, for a Man to be a Lord in his
  Closet. Nothing can be honourable to a Man apart from the World, but
  the Reflection upon worthy Actions; and he that places Honour in a
  Consciousness of Well-doing, will have but little Relish for any
  outward Homage that is paid him, since what gives him distinction to
  himself, cannot come within the Observation of his Beholders. Thus all
  the Words of Lordship, Honour, and Grace, are only Repetitions to a
  Man that the King has order'd him to be called so; but no Evidences
  that there is any thing in himself that would give the Man who applies
  to him those Ideas, without the Creation of his Master.<br>
<br>
  'I have, most noble <i>Pharamond</i>, all Honours and all Titles in your
  own Approbation; I triumph in them as they are your Gift, I refuse
  them as they are to give me the Observation of others. Indulge me, my
  Noble Master, in this Chastity of Renown; let me know my self in the
  Favour of <i>Pharamond</i>; and look down upon the Applause of the People.<br>
<br>
  <i>I am,<br>
  in all Duty and Loyally,<br>
    Your Majesty's most obedient<br>
        Subject and Servant</i>,<br>
                          Jean Chezluy.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
<i><b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  'I need not tell you with what Disadvantages Men of low Fortunes and
  great Modesty come into the World; what wrong Measures their
  Diffidence of themselves, and Fear of offending, often obliges them to
  take; and what a Pity it is that their greatest Virtues and Qualities,
  that should soonest recommend them, are the main Obstacle in the way
  of their Preferment.<br>
<br>
  'This, <b>Sir</b> , is my Case; I was bred at a Country-School, where I
  learned <i>Latin</i> and <i>Greek</i>. The Misfortunes of my Family forced me up
  to Town, where a Profession of the politer sort has protected me
  against Infamy and Want. I am now Clerk to a Lawyer, and, in times of
  Vacancy and Recess from Business, have made my self Master of
  <i>Italian</i> and <i>French</i>; and tho' the Progress I have made in my
  Business has gain'd me Reputation enough for one of my standing, yet
  my Mind suggests to me every day, that it is not upon that Foundation
  I am to build my Fortune.<br>
<br>
  'The Person I have my present Dependance upon, has it in his Nature,
  as well as in his Power, to advance me, by recommending me to a
  Gentleman that is going beyond Sea in a publick Employment. I know the
  printing this Letter would point me out to those I want Confidence to
  speak to, and I hope it is not in your Power to refuse making any Body
  happy.<br>

which different Persons have of the same thing. If Men of low Condition
very often set a Value on Things, which are not prized by those who are
in an higher Station of Life, there are many things these esteem which
are in no Value among Persons of an inferior Rank. Common People are, in
particular, very much astonished, when they hear of those solemn
Contests and Debates, which are made among the Great upon the
Punctilio's of a publick Ceremony, and wonder to hear that any Business
of Consequence should be retarded by those little Circumstances, which
they represent to themselves as trifling and insignificant. I <a name="fr4812">am</a>
mightily pleased with a Porter's Decision in one of Mr. <i>Southern's</i>
Plays<a href="#f4812"><sup>2</sup></a>, which is founded upon that fine Distress of a Virtuous
Woman's marrying a second Husband, while her first was yet living. The
first Husband, who was suppos'd to have been dead, returning to his
House after a long Absence, raises a noble Perplexity for the Tragick
Part of the Play. In the mean while, the Nurse and the Porter conferring
upon the Difficulties that would ensue in such a Case, honest <i>Sampson</i>
thinks the matter may be easily decided, and solves it very judiciously,
by the old Proverb, that if his first Master be still living, <i>The Man
must have his Mare again</i>. There is <a name="fr4813">nothing</a> in my time which has so much
surprized and confounded the greatest part of my honest Countrymen, as
the present Controversy between Count <i>Rechteren</i> and Monsieur

all the Affairs of <i>Europe</i> in suspence<a href="#f4813"><sup>3</sup></a>.<br>
<br>
Upon my going into a Coffee-house yesterday, and lending an ear to the
next Table, which was encompassed with a Circle of inferior Politicians,
one of them, after having read over the News very attentively, broke out
into the following Remarks. I am afraid, says he, this unhappy Rupture
between the Footmen at <i>Utrecht</i> will retard the Peace of Christendom. I
wish the Pope may not be at the Bottom of it. His Holiness has a very
good hand at fomenting a Division, as the poor <i>Suisse Cantons</i> have
lately experienced to their Cost. <a name="fr4814">If</a> Mo<span style="color: #663300;">u</span>nsieur<a href="#f4814"><sup>4</sup></a>
<i>What-d'ye-call-him's</i> Domesticks will not come to an Accommodation, I
do not know how the Quarrel can be ended, but by a Religious War.<br>
<br>
Why truly, says a <i>Wiseacre</i> that sat by him, were I as the King of
<i>France</i>, I would scorn to take part with the Footmen of either side:
Here's all the Business of <i>Europe</i> stands still, because Mo<span style="color: #663300;">u</span>nsieur
<i>Mesnager's</i> Man has had his Head broke. If Count <i>Rectrum</i> had given
them a Pot of Ale after it, all would have been well, without any of
this Bustle; but they say he's a warm Man, and does not care to be made
Mouths at.<br>
<br>
Upon <a name="fr4815">this</a>, one, that had held his Tongue hitherto, <span style="color: #663300;">began</span><a href="#f4815"><sup>5</sup></a> to exert
himself; declaring, that he was very well pleased the Plenipotentiaries
of our Christian Princes took this matter into their serious
Consideration; for that Lacqueys were never so saucy and pragmatical, as
they are now-a-days, and that he should be glad to see them taken down
in the Treaty of Peace, if it might be done without prejudice to <span style="color: #663300;">the</span>
Publick Affairs.<br>
<br>
One who sat at the other End of the Table, and seemed to be in the
Interests of the <i>French</i> King, told them, that they did not take the
matter right, for that his most Christian Majesty did not resent this
matter because it was an Injury done to Monsieur <i>Mesnager's</i> Footmen;
for, says he, what are Monsieur <i>Mesnager's</i> Footmen to him? but because
it was done to his Subjects. Now, says he, let me tell you, it would
look very odd for a Subject of <i>France</i> to have a bloody Nose, and his
Sovereign not to take Notice of it. He is obliged in Honour to defend
his People against Hostilities; and if the <i>Dutch</i> will be so insolent
to a Crowned Head, as, in any wise, to cuff or kick those who are under
<i>His</i> Protection, I think he is in the right to call them to an Account
for it.<br>
<br>
This Distinction set the Controversy upon a new Foot, and seemed to be
very well approved by most that heard it, till a little warm Fellow, who
declared himself a Friend to the House of <i>Austria</i>, fell most
unmercifully upon his <i>Gallick</i> Majesty, as encouraging his Subjects to
make Mouths at their Betters, and afterwards screening them from the
Punishment that was due to their Insolence. To which he added that the
<i>French</i> Nation was so addicted to Grimace, that if there was not a Stop
put to it at the General Congress, there would be no walking the Streets
for them in a time of Peace, especially if they continued Masters of the
<i>West-Indies</i>. The little Man proceeded with a great deal of warmth,
declaring that if the Allies were of his Mind, he would oblige the
<i>French</i> King to burn his Gallies, and tolerate the Protestant Religion
in his Dominions, before he would Sheath his Sword. He concluded with
calling Mo<span style="color: #663300;">u</span>nsieur <i>Mesnager</i> an Insignificant Prig.<br>
<br>
The Dispute was now growing very Warm, and one does not know where it
would have ended, had not a young Man of about One and Twenty, who seems
to have been brought up with an Eye to the Law, taken the Debate into
his Hand, and given it as his Opinion, that neither Count <i>Rechteren</i>
nor Mo[u]nsieur <i>Mesnager</i> had behaved themselves right in this Affair.
Count <i>Rechteren</i>, says he, should have made Affidavit that his Servants
had been affronted, and then Mo<span style="color: #663300;">u</span>nsieur <i>Mesnager</i> would have done him
Justice, by taking away their Liveries from 'em, or some other way that
he might have thought the most proper; for let me tell you, if a Man
makes a Mouth at me, I am not to knock the Teeth out of it for his
Pains. Then again, as for Mo[u]nsieur <i>Mesnager</i>, upon his Servants
being beaten, why! he might have had his Action of Assault and Battery.
But as the case now stands, if you will have my Opinion, I think they
ought to bring it to Referees.<br>
<br>
I heard a great deal more of this Conference, but I must confess with
little Edification; for all I could learn at last from these honest
Gentlemen, was, that the matter in Debate was of too high a Nature for
such Heads as theirs, or mine, to Comprehend.<br>

<a name="f4813"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote 3:</span></a> &nbsp; The negotiations for Peace which were going on at Utrecht
had been checked by the complaint of Count Rechteren, deputy for the
Province of Overyssel. On the 24th of July the French, under Marshal
Villars, had obtained a great victory at Denain, capturing the Earl of
Albemarle, the Princes of Anhalt, of Holstein, Nassau Seeken, and 2500
men, under the eyes of Prince Eugene, who was stopped at the bridge of
Prouy on his way to rescue and entreated by the deputies of the
States-general to retire. The allies lost a thousand killed and fifteen
hundred drowned; the French only five hundred, and sixty flags were sent
as trophies to Versailles. The insecure position taken by the Earl of
Albemarle had been forced on Prince Eugene by the Dutch deputies, who
found the arrangement cheapest. 

<blockquote><i>'Tell me,' he said, 'of the conquests of Alexander. He had no Dutch deputies in his army.' </i></blockquote>

Count Rechteren,
deputy for Overyssel, complained that, a few days after this battle,
when he was riding in his carriage by the gate of M. M&eacute;nager, the French
Plenipotentiary, that gentleman's lackeys insulted his lackeys with
grimaces and indecent gestures. He sent his secretary to complain to M.
M&eacute;nager, demand satisfaction, and say that if it were not given, he
should take it. M&eacute;nager replied, in writing, that although this was but
an affair between lackeys, he was far from approving ill behaviour in
his servants towards other servants, particularly towards servants of
Count Rechteren, and he was ready to send to the Count those lackeys
whom he had seen misbehaving, or even those whom his other servants
should point out as guilty of the offensive conduct. Rechteren, when the
answer arrived, was gone to the Hague, and it was forwarded to his
colleague, M. Mo&Icirc;rman. Upon his return to Utrecht, Rechteren sent his
secretary again to M&eacute;nager, with the complaint as before, and received
the answer as before. He admitted that he had not himself seen the
grimaces and insulting gestures, but he ought, he said, to be at liberty
to send his servants into M&eacute;nager's house for the detection of the
offenders. A few days afterwards M&eacute;nager and Rechteren were on the chief
promenade of Utrecht, with others who were Plenipotentiaries of the
United Provinces, and after exchange of civilities, Rechteren said that
he was still awaiting satisfaction. M&eacute;nager replied as before, and said
that his lackeys all denied the charge against them. M&eacute;nager refused
also to allow the accusers of his servants to come into his house and be
their judges. Rechteren said he would have justice yet upon master and
men. He was invested with a sovereign power as well as M&eacute;nager. He was
not a man to take insults. He spoke some words in Dutch to his
attendants, and presently M&eacute;nager's lackeys came with complaint that the
lackeys of Rechteren tripped them up behind, threw them upon their
faces, and threatened them with knives. Rechteren told the French
Plenipotentiary that he would pay them for doing that, and discharge
them if they did not do it. Rechteren's colleagues did what they could
to cover or excuse his folly, and begged that the matter might not
appear in a despatch to France or be represented to the States-general,
but be left to the arbitration of the English Plenipotentiaries. This
the French assented to, but they now demanded satisfaction against
Rechteren, and refused to accept the excuse made for him, that he was
drunk. He might, under other circumstances, says M. Torcy, the French
minister of the time, in his account of the Peace Negociations, have
dismissed the petty quarrel of servants by accepting such an excuse but,
says M. de Torcy, 

<blockquote><i>'it was de<b>Sir</b> able to retard the Conferences, and this
dispute gave a plausible reason.'</i></blockquote>

 Therefore until the King of France and
Bolingbroke had come to a complete understanding, the King of France
ordered his three Plenipotentiaries to keep the States-general busy,
with the task of making it clear to his French Majesty whether
Rechteren's violence was sanctioned by them, or whether he had acted
under private passion, excited by the Ministers of the House of Austria.
Then they must further assent to a prescribed form of disavowal, and
deprive Rechteren of his place as a deputy. This was the high policy of
the affair of the lackeys, which, as Addison says, held all the affairs
of Europe in suspense, a policy avowed with all complacency by the high
politician who was puller of the strings. (<i>Memoires de Torcy</i>, Vol. iii.
pp. 411-13.)<br>

When I have published any single Paper that falls in with the Popular
Taste, and pleases more than ordinary, it always brings me in a great
return of Letters. My <i>Tuesday's</i> Discourse, wherein I gave several
Admonitions to the Fraternity of the <i>Henpeck'd</i>, has already produced
me very many Correspondents; the Reason I cannot guess at, unless it be
that such a Discourse is of general Use, and every married Man's Money.
An honest Tradesman, who dates his Letter from <i>Cheapside</i>, sends me
Thanks in the name of a Club, who, he tells me, meet as often as their
Wives will give them leave, and stay together till they are sent for
home. He informs me, that my Paper has administered great Consolation to
their whole Club, and de<b>Sir</b> es me to give some further Account of
<i>Socrates</i>, and to acquaint them in whose Reign he lived, whether he was
a Citizen or a Courtier, whether he buried <i>Xantippe</i>, with many other
particulars: For that by his Sayings he appears to have been a very Wise
Man and a good Christian. Another, who writes himself <i>Benjamin Bamboo</i>,
tells me, that being coupled with a Shrew, he had endeavoured to tame
her by such lawful means as those which I mentioned in my last
<i>Tuesday's</i> Paper, and that in his Wrath he had often gone further than
<i>Bracton</i> allows in those cases; but that for the future he was resolved
to bear it like a Man of Temper and Learning, and consider her only as
one who lives in his House to teach him Philosophy. <i>Tom Dapperwit</i>
says, that he agrees with me in that whole Discourse, excepting only the
last Sentence, where I affirm the married State to be either an Heaven
or an Hell. <i>Tom</i> has been at the charge of a Penny upon this occasion,
to tell me, that by his Experience it is neither one nor the other, but
rather that middle kind of State, commonly known by the Name of
<i>Purgatory</i>.<br>
<br>
The Fair Sex have likewise obliged me with their Reflections upon the
same Discourse. A Lady, who calls herself <i>Euterpe</i>, and seems a Woman
of Letters, asks me whether I am for establishing the <i>Salick</i> Law in
every Family, and why it is not fit that a Woman who has Discretion and
Learning should sit at the Helm, when the Husband is weak and
illiterate? Another, of a quite contrary Character, subscribes herself
<i>Xantippe</i>, and tells me, that she follows the Example of her Name-sake;
for being married to a Bookish Man, who has no Knowledge of the World,
she is forced to take their Affairs into her own Hands, and to spirit
him up now and then, that he may not grow musty, and unfit for
Conversation.<br>
<br>
After this Abridgment of some Letters which are come to my hands upon
this Occasion, I shall publish one of them at large.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  You have given us a lively Picture of that kind of Husband who comes
  under the Denomination of the Hen-peck'd; but I do not remember that
  you have ever touched upon one that is of the quite different
  Character, and who, in several Places of <i>England</i>, goes by the Name
  of a Cot-Quean. I <a name="fr4821">have</a> the Misfortune to be joined for Life with one
  of this Character, who in reality is more a Woman than <span style="color: #663300;">I am</span><a href="#f4821"><sup>1</sup></a>. He
  was bred up under the Tuition of a tender Mother, till she had made
  him as good a House-wife as her self. He could preserve Apricots, and
  make Gellies, before he had been two Years out of the Nursery. He was
  never suffered to go abroad, for fear of catching Cold: when he should
  have been hunting down a Buck, he was by his Mother's Side learning
  how to Season it, or put it in Crust; and was making Paper-Boats with
  his Sisters, at an Age when other young Gentlemen are crossing the
  Seas, or travelling into Foreign Countries. He has the whitest Hand
  that you ever saw in your Life, and raises Paste better than any Woman
  in <i>England</i>. These Qualifications make him a sad Husband: He is
  perpetually in the Kitchin, and has a thousand Squabbles with the
  Cook-maid. He is better acquainted with the Milk-Score, than his
  Steward's Accounts. I fret to Death when I hear him find fault with a
  Dish that is not dressed to his liking, and instructing his Friends
  that dine with him in the best Pickle for a Walnut, or Sauce for an
  Haunch of Venison. With all this, he is a very good-natured Husband,
  and never fell out with me in his Life but once, upon the
  over-roasting of a Dish of Wild-Fowl: At the same time I must own I
  would rather he was a Man of a rough Temper, that would treat me
  harshly sometimes, than of such an effeminate busy Nature in a
  Province that does not belong to him. Since you have given us the
  Character of a Wife who wears the Breeches, pray say something of a
  Husband that wears the Petticoat. Why should not a Female Character be
  as ridiculous in a Man, as a Male Character in one of our Sex?<br>

We cannot be guilty of a greater Act of Uncharitableness, than to
interpret the Afflictions which befal our Neighbours, as <i>Punishments</i>
and <i>Judgments</i>. It aggravates the Evil to him who suffers, when he
looks upon himself as the Mark of Divine Vengeance, and abates the
Compassion of those towards him, who regard him in so dreadful a Light.
This Humour of turning every Misfortune into a Judgment, proceeds from
wrong Notions of Religion, which, in its own nature, produces Goodwill
towards Men, and puts the mildest Construction upon every Accident that
befalls them. In this case, therefore, it is not Religion that sours a
Man's Temper, but it is his Temper that sours his Religion: People of
gloomy unchearful Imaginations, or of envious malignant Tempers,
whatever kind of Life they are engaged in, will discover their natural
Tincture of Mind in all their Thoughts, Words, and Actions. As the
finest Wines have often the Taste of the Soil, so even the most
religious Thoughts often draw something that is particular from the
Constitution of the Mind in which they arise. When Folly or Superstition
strike in with this natural Depravity of Temper, it is not in the power,
even of Religion it self, to preserve the Character of the Person who is
possessed with it, from appearing highly absurd and ridiculous.<br>
<br>
An old Maiden Gentlewoman, whom I shall conceal under the Name of
<i>Nemesis</i>, is the greatest Discoverer of Judgments that I have met with.
She can tell you what Sin it was that set such a Man's House on fire, or
blew down his Barns. Talk to her of an unfortunate young Lady that lost
her Beauty by the Small-Pox, she fetches a deep Sigh, and tells you,
that when she had a fine Face she was always looking on it in her Glass.
Tell her of a Piece of good Fortune that has befallen one of her
Acquaintance; and she wishes it may prosper with her, but her Mother
used one of her Nieces very barbarously. Her usual Remarks turn upon
People who had great Estates, but never enjoyed them, by reason of some
Flaw in their own, or their Father's Behaviour. She can give you the
Reason why such a one died Childless: Why such an one was cut off in the
Flower of his Youth: Why such an one was Unhappy in her Marriage: Why
one broke his Leg on such a particular Spot of Ground, and why another
was killed with a Back-Sword, rather than with any other kind of Weapon.
She has a Crime for every Misfortune that can befal any of her
Acquaintance, and when she hears of a Robbery that has been made, or a
Murder that has been committed, enlarges more on the Guilt of the
suffering Person, than on that of the Thief, or the Assassin. In short,
she is so good a Christian, that whatever happens to her self is a
Tryal, and whatever happens to her Neighbours is a Judgment.<br>
<br>
The very Description of this Folly, in ordinary Life, is sufficient to
expose it; but when it appears in a Pomp and Dignity of Style, it is
very apt to amuse and terrify the Mind of the Reader. <i>Herodotus</i> and
<i>Plutarch</i> very often apply their Judgments as impertinently as the old
Woman I have before mentioned, though their manner of relating them,
makes the Folly it self appear venerable. <a name="fr4831">Indeed</a>, most Historians, as
well Christian as Pagan, have fallen into this idle Superstition, and
spoken of ill <span style="color: #663300;">Success</span><a href="#f4831"><sup>1</sup></a>, unforeseen Disasters, and terrible Events,
as if they had been let into the Secrets of Providence, and made
acquainted with that private Conduct by which the World is governed. One
would think several of our own Historians in particular had many
Revelations of this kind made to them. Our old <i>English</i> Monks seldom
let any of their Kings depart in Peace, who had endeavoured to diminish
the Power or Wealth of which the Ecclesiasticks were in those times
possessed. <i>William the Conqueror's</i> Race generally found their
Judgments in the <i>New Forest</i>, where their Father had pulled down
Churches and Monasteries. In short, read one of the Chronicles written
by an Author of this frame of Mind, and you would think you were reading
an History of the Kings of <i>Israel</i> or <i>Judah</i>, where the Historians
were actually inspired, and where, by a particular Scheme of Providence,
the Kings were distinguished by Judgments or Blessings, according as
they promoted Idolatry or the Worship of the true God.<br>
<br>
I cannot but look upon this manner of judging upon Misfortunes, not only
to be very uncharitable, in regard to the Person whom they befall, but
very presumptuous in regard to him who is supposed to inflict them. It
is a strong Argument for a State of Retribution hereafter, that in this
World virtuous Persons are very often unfortunate, and vicious Persons
prosperous; which is wholly repugnant to the Nature of a Being who
appears infinitely wise and good in all his Works, unless we may suppose
that such a promiscuous and undistinguishing Distribution of Good and
Evil, which was necessary for carrying on the Designs of Providence in
this Life, will be rectified and made amends for in another. We are not
therefore to expect that Fire should fall from Heaven in the ordinary
Course of Providence; nor when we see triumphant Guilt or depressed
Virtue in particular Persons, that Omnipotence will make bare its holy
Arm in the Defence of the one, or Punishment of the other. It is
sufficient that there is a Day set apart for the hearing and requiting
of both according to their respective Merits.<br>
<br>
The Folly of ascribing Temporal Judgments to any particular Crimes, may
appear from several Considerations. I shall only mention two: First,
That, generally speaking, there is no Calamity or Affliction, which is
supposed to have happened as a Judgment to a vicious Man, which does not
sometimes happen to Men of approved Religion and <a name="fr4832">Virtue</a>. When <i>Diagoras</i>
the Atheist<a href="#f4832"><sup>2</sup></a> was on board one of the <i>Athenian</i> Ships, there arose a
very violent Tempest; upon which the Mariners told him, that it was a
just Judgment upon them for having taken so impious a Man on board.
<i>Diagoras</i> begged them to look upon the rest of the Ships that were in
the same Distress, and ask'd them whether or no <i>Diagoras</i> was on board
every Vessel in the Fleet. We are all involved in the same Calamities,
and subject to the same Accidents: and when we see any one of the
Species under any particular Oppression, we should look upon it as
arising from the common Lot of human Nature, rather than from the Guilt
of the Person who suffers.<br>
<br>
Another Consideration, that may check our Presumption in putting such a
Construction upon a Misfortune, is this, That it is impossible for us to
know what are Calamities, and what are Blessings. How many Accidents
have pass'd for Misfortunes, which have turned to the Welfare and
Prosperity of the Persons in whose Lot they have fallen? How many
Disappointments have, in their Consequences, saved a man from Ruin? If
we could look into the Effects of every thing, we might be allowed to
pronounce boldly upon Blessings and Judgments; but for a Man to give his
Opinion of what he sees but in part, and in its Beginnings, is an
unjustifiable Piece of Rashness and Folly. The Story of <i>Biton</i> and
<i>Clitobus</i>, which was in great Reputation among the Heathens, (for we
see it quoted by all the ancient Authors, both <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i>, who
have written upon the Immortality of the Soul,) may teach us a Caution
in this Matter. These two Brothers, being the Sons of a Lady who was
Priestess to <i>Juno</i>, drew their Mother's Chariot to the Temple at the
time of a great Solemnity, the Persons being absent who by their Office
were to have drawn her Chariot on that Occasion. The Mother was so
transported with this Instance of filial Duty, that she petition'd her
Goddess to bestow upon them the greatest Gift that could be given to
Men; upon which they were both cast into a deep Sleep, and the next
Morning found dead in the Temple. This was such an Event, as would have
been construed into a Judgment, had it happen'd to the two Brothers
after an Act of Disobedience, and would doubtless have been represented
as such by any Ancient Historian who had given us an Account of it.<br>

  nisi illi materia, occasio, fautor etiam, commendatorque contingat.</i><br>

  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  Of all the young Fellows who are in their Progress thro' any
  Profession, none seem to have so good a Title to the Protection of the
  Men of Eminence in it as the modest Man; not so much because his
  Modesty is a certain Indication of his Merit, as because 'tis a
  certain Obstacle to the producing of it. Now, as of all Professions
  this Virtue is thought to be more particularly unnecessary in that of
  the Law than in any other, I shall only apply my self to the Relief of
  such who follow this Profession with this Disadvantage. What
  aggravates the matter is, that those Persons who, the better to
  prepare themselves for this Study, have made some Progress in others,
  have, by addicting themselves to Letters, encreased their natural
  Modesty, and consequently heighten'd the Obstruction to this sort of
  Preferment; so that every one of these may emphatically be said to be
  such a one as <i>laboureth and taketh pains, and is still the more
  behind</i>. It may be a Matter worth discussing then, Why that which made
  a Youth so amiable to the Ancients, should make him appear so
  ridiculous to the Moderns? and, Why in our days there should be
  Neglect, and even Oppression of young Beginners, instead of that
  Protection which was the Pride of theirs? In the Profession spoken of,
  'tis obvious to every one whose Attendance is required at
  <i>Westminster-Hall</i>, with what Difficulty a Youth of any Modesty has
  been permitted to make an Observation, that could in no wise detract
  from the Merit of his Elders, and is absolutely necessary for the
  advancing his own. I have often seen one of these not only molested in
  his Utterance of something very pertinent, but even plunder'd of his
  Question, and by a strong Serjeant shoulder'd out of his Rank, which
  he has recover'd with much Difficulty and Confusion. Now as great part
  of the Business of this Profession might be dispatched by one that
  perhaps

<blockquote><i>&mdash;Abest virtute diserti<br>
    Messal&aelig;, nec scit quantum Causellius Aulus&mdash;</i><br>
<br>
Hor.</blockquote>

  so I can't conceive the Injustice done to the Publick, if the Men of
  Reputation in this Calling would introduce such of the young ones into
  Business, whose Application to this Study will let them into the
  Secrets of it, as much as their Modesty will hinder them from the
  Practice: I say, it would be laying an everlasting Obligation upon a
  young Man, to be introduc'd at first only as a Mute, till by this
  Countenance, and a Resolution to support the good Opinion conceiv'd of
  him in his Betters, his Complexion shall be so well settled, that the
  Litigious of this Island may be secure of his obstreperous Aid. If I
  might be indulged to speak in the Style of a Lawyer, I would say, That
  any one about thirty years of Age, might make a common Motion to the
  Court with as much Elegance and Propriety as the most aged Advocates
  in the Hall.<br>
<br>
  I can't advance the Merit of Modesty by any Argument of my own so
  powerfully, as by enquiring into the Sentiments the greatest among the
  Ancients of different Ages entertain'd upon this Virtue. If we go back
  to the Days of <i>Solomon</i>, we shall find Favour a necessary Consequence
  to a shame-fac'd Man. <i>Pliny</i>, the greatest Lawyer and most Elegant
  Writer of the Age he lived in, in several of his Epistles is very
  sollicitous in recommending to the Publick some young Men of his own
  Profession, and very often undertakes to become an Advocate, upon
  condition that some one of these his Favourites might be joined with
  him, in order to produce the Merit of such, whose Modesty otherwise
  would have suppressed it. It may <a name="fr4841">seem</a> very marvellous to a saucy
  Modern, that <i>Multum sanguinis, multum verecundi&aelig;, multum
  sollicitudinis in ore; to have the Face first full of Blood, then the
  Countenance dashed with Modesty, and then the whole Aspect as of one
  dying with Fear, when a Man begins to speak;</i> should be esteem'd by
  <i>Pliny</i> the necessary Qualifications of a fine Speaker<a href="#f4841"><sup>1</sup></a>.
  <i>Shakespear</i> <a name="fr4842">has</a> also express'd himself in the same favourable Strain
  of Modesty, when he says,

<blockquote><i>&mdash;In the Modesty of fearful Duty<br>
    I read as much as from the rattling Tongue<br>
    Of saucy and audacious Eloquence&mdash;</i><a href="#f4842"><sup>2</sup></a></blockquote>

  Now since these Authors have profess'd themselves for the Modest Man,
  even in the utmost Confusions of Speech and Countenance, why should an
  intrepid Utterance and a resolute Vociferation thunder so successfully
  in our Courts of Justice? And why should that Confidence of Speech and
  Behaviour, which seems to acknowledge no Superior, and to defy all
  Contradiction, prevail over that Deference and Resignation with which
  the Modest Man implores that favourable Opinion which the other seems
  to command?<br>
<br>
  As the Case at present stands, the best Consolation that I can
  administer to those who cannot get into that Stroke of Business (as
  the Phrase is) which they deserve, is to reckon every particular
  Acquisition of Knowledge in this Study as a real Increase of their
  Fortune; and fully to believe, that one day this imaginary Gain will
  certainly be made out by one more substantial. I wish you would talk
  to us a little on this Head, you would oblige,<br>
<br>
 <i> <b>Sir</b> ,<br>
<br>
  Your most humble Servant.</i>

<br>
The Author of this Letter is certainly a Man of good Sense; but I am
perhaps particular in my Opinion on this Occasion; for I have observed,
that under the Notion of Modesty, Men have indulged themselves in a
Spiritless Sheepishness, and been for ever lost to themselves, their
Families, their Friends, and their Country. When a Man has taken care to
pretend to nothing but what he may justly aim at, and can execute as
well as any other, without Injustice to any other; it is ever want of
Breeding or Courage to be brow-beaten or elbow'd out of his honest
Ambition. I have said often, Modesty must be an Act of the Will, and yet
it always implies Self-Denial: For if a Man has an ardent De<b>Sir</b> e to do
what is laudable for him to perform, and, from an unmanly Bashfulness,
shrinks away, and lets his Merit languish in Silence, he ought not to be
angry at the World that a more unskilful Actor succeeds in his Part,
because he has not Confidence to come upon the Stage himself. The
Generosity my Correspondent mentions of <i>Pliny</i>, cannot be enough
applauded. To cherish the Dawn of Merit, and hasten its Maturity, was a
Work worthy a noble <i>Roman</i> and a liberal Scholar. That Concern which is
described in the Letter, is to all the World the greatest Charm
imaginable: but then the modest Man must proceed, and shew a latent
Resolution in himself; for the Admiration of his Modesty arises from the
Manifestation of his Merit. I must confess we live in an Age wherein a
few empty Blusterers carry away the Praise of Speaking, while a Crowd of
Fellows over-stock'd with Knowledge are run down by them. I say
Over-stock'd, because they certainly are so as to their Service of
Mankind, if from their very Store they raise to themselves Ideas of
Respect, and Greatness of the Occasion, and I know not what, to disable
themselves from explaining their Thoughts. I must confess, when I have
seen <i>Charles Frankair</i> rise up with a commanding Mien, and Torrent of
handsome Words, talk a Mile off the Purpose, and drive down twenty
bashful Boobies of ten times his Sense, who at the same time were
envying his Impudence and despising his Understanding, it has been
matter of great Mirth to me; but it soon ended in a secret Lamentation,
that the Fountains of every thing praiseworthy in these Realms, the
Universities, should be so muddied with a false Sense of this Virtue, as
to produce Men capable of being so abused. I will be bold to say, that
it is a ridiculous Education which does not qualify a Man to make his
best Appearance before the greatest Man and the finest Woman to whom he
can address himself. Were this judiciously corrected in the Nurseries of
Learning, pert Coxcombs would know their Distance: But we must bear with
this false Modesty in our young Nobility and Gentry, till they cease at
<i>Oxford</i> and <i>Cambridge</i> to grow dumb in the Study of Eloquence.<br>

  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'My <a name="fr4851">Lord</a> <i>Clarendon</i> has observed, <i>That few Men have done more harm
  than those who have been thought to be able to do least; and there
  cannot be a greater Error, than to believe a Man whom we see qualified
  with too mean Parts to do good, to be therefore incapable of doing
  hurt. There is a Supply of Malice, of Pride, of Industry, and even of
  Folly, in the Weakest, when he sets his heart upon it, that makes a
  strange progress in Mischief</i><a href="#f4851"><sup>1</sup></a>.  What may seem to the Reader the
  greatest Paradox in the Reflection of the Historian, is, I suppose,
  that Folly, which is generally thought incapable of contriving or
  executing any Design, should be so formidable to those whom it exerts
  it self to molest. But this will appear very plain, if we remember
  that <i>Solomon</i> says, <i>It is as Sport to a Fool to do mischief</i>; and
  that he might the more emphatically express the calamitous
  Circumstances of him who falls under the displeasure of this wanton
  Person, the same Author adds further, <i>That a Stone is heavy, and the
  Sand weighty, but a Fool's Wrath is heavier than them both</i>. It is
  impossible to suppress my own Illustration upon this Matter, which is,
  That as the Man of Sagacity bestirs himself to distress his Enemy by
  Methods probable and reducible to Reason, so the same Reason will
  fortify his Enemy to elude these his regular Efforts; but your Fool
  projects, acts, and concludes with such notable Inconsistence, that no
  regular Course of Thought can evade or counterplot his prodigious
  Machinations. My Frontispiece, I believe, may be extended to imply,
  That several of our Misfortunes arise from Things, as well as Persons,
  that seem of very little consequence. Into what tragical
  Extravagancies does <i>Shakespear</i> hurry <i>Othello</i> upon the loss of an
  Handkerchief only? and what Barbarities does <i>Desdemona</i> suffer from a
  slight Inadvertency in regard to this fatal Trifle? If the Schemes of
  all enterprizing Spirits were to be carefully examined, some
  intervening Accident, not considerable enough to occasion any Debate
  upon, or give 'em any apprehension of ill Consequence from it, will be
  found to be the occasion of their ill Success, rather than any Error
  in Points of Moment and Difficulty, which naturally engag'd their
  maturest Deliberations. If you go to the Lev&eacute;e of any great Man, you
  will observe him exceeding gracious to several very insignificant
  Fellows; and this upon this Maxim, That the Neglect of any Person must
  arise from the mean Opinion you have of his Capacity to do you any
  Service or Prejudice; and that this calling his Sufficiency in
  question, must give him Inclination, and where this is, there never
  wants Strength or Opportunity to annoy you. There is no body so weak
  of Invention, that can't aggravate or make some little Stories to
  vilify his Enemy; and there are very few but have good Inclinations to
  hear 'em, and 'tis infinite Pleasure to the Majority of Mankind to
  level a Person superior to his Neighbours. Besides, in all matter of
  Controversy, that Party which has the greatest Abilities labours under
  this Prejudice, that he will certainly be supposed, upon Account of
  his Abilities, to have done an Injury, when perhaps he has received
  one. It would be tedious to enumerate the Strokes that Nations and
  particular Friends have suffer'd from Persons very contemptible.<br>
<br>
I Think <i>Henry</i> IV. of <i>France</i>, so formidable to his Neighbours,
  could no more be secur'd against the resolute Villany of <i>Ravillac</i>,
  than <i>Villiers</i>, Duke of <i>Buckingham</i>, could be against that of
  <i>Felton</i>. And there is no incens'd Person so destitute, but can
  provide himself with a Knife or a Pistol, if he finds stomach to apply
  them. That Things and Persons of no moment should give such powerful
  Revolutions to the progress of those of the greatest, seems a
  providential Disposition to baffle and abate the Pride of human
  Sufficiency; as also to engage the Humanity and Benevolence of
  Superiors to all below 'em, by letting them into this Secret, that the
  Stronger depends upon the Weaker.<br>

<br>
  <i>Dear <b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  'I received a Letter from you some time ago, which I should have
  answered sooner, had you informed me in yours to what part of this
  Island I might have directed my Impertinence; but having been let into
  the Knowledge of that Matter, this handsome Excuse is no longer
  serviceable. My Neighbour <i>Prettyman</i> shall be the Subject of this
  Letter; who falling in with the <b>Spectator's</b> Doctrine concerning the
  Month of <i>May</i>, began from that Season to dedicate himself to the
  Service of the Fair in the following Manner. I observed at the
  Beginning of the Month he bought him a new Night-gown, either side to
  be worn outwards, both equally gorgeous and attractive; but till the
  End of the Month I did not enter so fully into the knowledge of his
  Contrivance, as the Use of that Garment has since suggested to me. Now
  you must know that all new Clothes raise and warm the Bearer's
  Imagination into a Conceit of his being a much finer Gentleman than he
  was before, banishing all Sobriety and Reflection, and giving him up
  to Gallantry and Amour. Inflam'd therefore with this way of thinking,
  and full of the Spirit of the Month of <i>May</i>, did this merciless Youth
  resolve upon the Business of Captivating. At first he confin'd himself
  to his Room only, now and then appearing at his Window in his
  Night-gown, and practising that easy Posture which expresses the very
  Top and Dignity of Languishment. It was pleasant to see him diversify
  his Loveliness, sometimes obliging the Passengers only with a
  Side-Face, with a Book in his Hand; sometimes being so generous as to
  expose the whole in the fulness of its Beauty; at the other times, by
  a judicious throwing back of his Perriwig, he would throw in his Ears.
  You know he is that Sort of Person which the Mob call a handsome jolly
  Man; which Appearance can't miss of Captives in this part of the Town.
  Being emboldened by daily Success, he leaves his Room with a
  Resolution to extend his Conquests; and I have apprehended him in his
  Night-gown smiting in all Parts of this Neighbourhood.<br>
<br>
  This I, being of an amorous Complection, saw with Indignation, and had
  Thoughts of purchasing a Wig in these Parts; into which, being at a
  greater Distance from the Earth, I might have thrown a very liberal
  Mixture of white Horse-hair, which would make a fairer, and
  consequently a handsomer Appearance, while my Situation would secure
  me against any Discoveries. But the Passion to the handsome Gentleman
  seems to be so fixed to that part of the Building, that it will be
  extremely difficult to divert it to mine; so that I am resolved to
  stand boldly to the Complection of my own Eye-brow, and prepare me an
  immense Black Wig of the same sort of Structure with that of my Rival.
  Now, tho' by this I shall not, perhaps, lessen the number of the
  Admirers of his Complection, I shall have a fair Chance to divide the
  Passengers by the irresistible Force of mine.<br>
<br>
  I expect sudden Dispatches from you, with Advice of the Family you are
  in now, how to deport my self upon this so delicate a Conjuncture;
  with some comfortable Resolutions in favour of the handsome black Man
  against the handsome fair one.<br>

<br>
  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'There are very many of my Acquaintance Followers of <i>Socrates</i>, with
  more particular regard to that part of his Philosophy which we, among,
  our selves, call his <i>Domesticks</i>; under which Denomination, or Title,
  we include all the Conjugal Joys and Sufferings. We have indeed, with
  very great Pleasure, observed the Honour you do the whole Fraternity
  of the Hen-peck'd, in placing that illustrious Man at our Head, and it
  does in a very great measure baffle the Raillery of pert Rogues, who
  have no advantage above us, but in that they are single. But when you
  look about into the Crowd of Mankind, you will find the Fair Sex
  reigns with greater Tyranny over Lovers than Husbands. You shall
  hardly meet one in a thousand who is wholly exempt from their
  Dominion, and those that are so, are capable of no Taste of Life, and
  breathe and walk about the Earth as Insignificants. But I am going to
  de<b>Sir</b> e your further Favour in behalf of our harmless Brotherhood, and
  hope you will shew in a true light the un-married Hen-peck'd, as well
  as you have done Justice to us, who submit to the Conduct of our
  Wives. I am very particularly acquainted with one who is under entire
  Submission to a kind Girl, as he calls her; and tho' he knows I have
  been Witness both to the ill Usage he has received from her, and his
  Inability to resist her Tyranny, he still pretends to make a Jest of
  me for a little more than ordinary Obsequiousness to my Spouse. No
  longer than <i>Tuesday</i> last he took me with him to visit his Mistress;
  and he having, it seems, been a little in Disgrace before, thought by
  bringing me with him she would constrain herself, and insensibly fall
  into general Discourse with him; and so he might break the Ice, and
  save himself all the ordinary Compunctions and Mortifications she used
  to make him suffer before she would be reconciled after any Act of
  Rebellion on his Part. When we came into the Room, we were received
  with the utmost Coldness; and when he presented me as Mr. Such-a-one,
  his very good Friend, she just had Patience to suffer my Salutation;
  but when he himself, with a very gay Air, offered to follow me, she
  gave him a thundering Box on the Ear, called him pitiful poor-spirited
  Wretch, how durst he see her Face? His Wig and Hat fell on different
  Parts of the Floor. She seized the Wig too soon for him to recover it,
  and kicking it down Stairs, threw herself into an opposite Room,
  pulling the Door after her with a Force, that you would have thought
  the Hinges would have given Way. We went down, you must think, with no
  very good Countenances; and as we sneaked off, and were driving home
  together, he confessed to me, that her Anger was thus highly raised,
  because he did not think fit to fight a Gentleman who had said she was
  what she was; but, says he, a kind Letter or two, or fifty pieces,
  will put her in Humour again. I asked him why he did not part with
  her; he answered, he loved her with all the Tenderness imaginable, and
  she had too many Charms to be abandoned for a little Quickness of
  Spirit. Thus does this illegitimate Hen-pecked over-look the Hussy's
  having no Regard to his very Life and Fame, in putting him upon an
  infamous Dispute about her Reputation; yet has he the Confidence to
  laugh at me, because I obey my poor Dear in keeping out of Harm's Way,
  and not staying too late from my own Family, to pass through the
  Hazards of a Town full of Ranters and Debauchees. You that are a
  Philosopher should urge in our behalf, that when we bear with a
  froward Woman, our Patience is preserved, in consideration that a
  breach with her might be a Dishonour to Children who are descended
  from us, and whose Concern makes us tolerate a thousand Frailties, for
  fear they should redound Dishonour upon the Innocent. This and the
  like Circumstances, which carry with them the most valuable Regards of
  human Life, may be mentioned for our long Suffering; but in the case
  of Gallants, they swallow ill Usage from one to whom they have no
  Obligation, but from a base Passion, which it is mean to indulge, and
  which it would be glorious to overcome.<br>
<br>
  'These Sort of Fellows are very numerous, and some have been
  conspicuously such, without Shame; nay they have carried on the Jest
  in the very Article of Death, and, to the Diminution of the Wealth and
  Happiness of their Families, in bar of those honourably near to them,
  have left immense Wealth to their Paramours. What is this but being a
  Cully in the Grave! Sure this is being Hen-peck'd with a Vengeance!
  But without dwelling upon these less frequent Instances of eminent
  Cullyism, what is there so common as to hear a Fellow curse his Fate
  that he cannot get rid of a Passion to a Jilt, and quote an Half-Line
  out of a Miscellany Poem to prove his Weakness is natural? If they
  will go on thus, I have nothing to say to it: But then let them not
  pretend to be free all this while, and laugh at us poor married
  Patients.<br>
<br>
  'I have known one Wench in this Town carry an haughty Dominion over
  her Lovers so well, that she has at the same time been kept by a
  Sea-Captain in the <i>Straits</i>, a Merchant in the City, a Country
  Gentleman in <i>Hampshire</i>, and had all her Correspondences managed by
  one she kept for her own Uses. This happy Man (as the Phrase is) used
  to write very punctually every Post, Letters for the Mistress to
  transcribe. He would sit in his Night-Gown and Slippers, and be as
  grave giving an Account, only changing Names, that there was nothing
  in those idle Reports they had heard of such a Scoundrel as one of the
  other Lovers was; and how could he think she could condescend so low,
  after such a fine Gentleman as each of them? For the same Epistle said
  the same thing to and of every one of them. And so Mr. Secretary and
  his Lady went to Bed with great Order.<br>
<br>
  'To be short, <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR, we Husbands shall never make the Figure
  we ought in the Imaginations of young Men growing up in the World,
  except you can bring it about that a Man of the Town shall be as
  infamous a Character as a Woman of the Town. But of all that I have
  met in my time, commend me to <i>Betty Duall</i>: She is the Wife of a
  Sailor, and the kept Mistress of a Man of Quality; she dwells with the
  latter during the Sea-faring of the former. The Husband asks no
  Questions, sees his Apartments furnished with Riches not his, when he
  comes into Port, and the Lover is as joyful as a Man arrived at his
  Haven when the other puts to Sea. <i>Betty</i> is the most eminently
  victorious of any of her Sex, and ought to stand recorded the only
  Woman of the Age in which she lives, who has possessed at the same
  time two Abused, and two Contented... </blockquote>

<br>

Tho' there are many Authors, who have written on Dreams, they have
generally considered them only as Revelations of what has already
happened in distant parts of the World, or as Presages of what is to
happen in future Periods of time.<br>
<br>
I shall consider this Subject in another Light, as Dreams may give us
some Idea of the great Excellency of an Human Soul, and some Intimation
of its Independency on Matter. In the first Place, our Dreams are great
Instances of that Activity which is natural to the human Soul, and which
it is not in the power of Sleep to deaden or abate. When the Man appears
tired and worn out with the Labours of the Day, this active part in his
Composition is still busied and unwearied. When the Organs of Sense want
their due Repose and necessary Reparations, and the Body is no longer
able to keep pace with that spiritual Substance to which it is united,
the Soul exerts her self in her several Faculties, and continues in
Action till her Partner is again qualified to bear her Company. In this
case Dreams look like the Relaxations and Amusements of the Soul, when
she is disincumbred of her Machine, her Sports and Recreations, when she
has laid her Charge asleep.<br>
<br>
In the Second Place, Dreams are an Instance of that Agility and
Perfection which is natural to the Faculties of the Mind, when they are
disengaged from the Body. The Soul is clogged and retarded in her
Operations, when she acts in Conjunction with a Companion that is so
heavy and unwieldy in its Motions. But in Dreams it is wonderful to
observe with what a Sprightliness and Alacrity she exerts her self. The
slow of Speech make unpremeditated Harangues, or converse readily in
Languages that they are but little acquainted with. The Grave abound in
Pleasantries, the Dull in Repartees and Points of Wit. There is not a
more painful Action of the Mind, than Invention; yet in Dreams it works
with that Ease and Activity, that we are not sensible when the Faculty
is employed. For instance, I believe every one, some time or other,
dreams that he is reading Papers, Books, or Letters; in which case the
Invention prompts so readily, that the Mind is imposed upon, and
mistakes its own Suggestions for the Compositions of another.<br>
<br>
I <a name="fr4871">shall</a>, under this Head, quote a Passage out of the <i>Religio Medici</i><a href="#f4871"><sup>1</sup></a>, in which the ingenious Author gives an account of himself in his
dreaming and his waking Thoughts. 

<blockquote><i>We are somewhat more than our selves in our Sleeps, and the Slumber
  of the Body seems to be but the Waking of the Soul. It is the
  Litigation of Sense, but the Liberty of Reason; and our waking
  Conceptions do not match the Fancies of our Sleeps. At my Nativity my
  Ascendant was the watery Sign of</i> Scorpius: I <i>was born in the
  Planetary Hour of</i> Saturn, <i>and I think I have a piece of that leaden
  Planet in me. I am no way facetious, nor disposed for the Mirth and
  Galliardize of Company; yet in one Dream I can compose a whole Comedy,
  behold the Action, apprehend the Jests, and laugh my self awake at the
  Conceits thereof. Were my Memory as faithful as my Reason is then
  fruitful, I would never study but in my Dreams; and this time also
  would I chuse for my Devotions: but our grosser Memories have then so
  little hold of our abstracted Understandings, that they forget the
  Story, and can only relate to our awaked Souls a confused and broken
  Tale of that that has passed&mdash;Thus it is observed that Men sometimes,
  upon the Hour of their Departure, do speak and reason above
  themselves; for then the Soul beginning to be freed from the Ligaments
  of the Body, begins to reason like her self, and to discourse in a
  strain above Mortality.</i></blockquote>

We may likewise observe in the third Place, that the Passions affect the
Mind with greater Strength when we are asleep, than when we are awake.
Joy and Sorrow give us more vigorous Sensations of Pain or Pleasure at
this time, than at any other. Devotion likewise, as the excellent Author
above-mentioned has hinted, is in a very particular manner heightned and
inflamed, when it rises in the Soul at a time that the Body is thus laid
at Rest. Every Man's Experience will inform him in this matter, though
it is very probable, that this may happen differently, in different
Constitutions. I shall conclude this Head with the two following
Problems, which I shall leave to the Solution of my Reader. Supposing a
Man always happy in his Dreams, and miserable in his waking Thoughts,
and that his Life was equally divided between them, whether would he be
more happy or miserable? Were a Man a King in his Dreams, and a Beggar
awake, and dreamt as consequentially, and in as continued unbroken
Schemes as he thinks when awake, whether he would be in reality a King
or Beggar, or rather whether he would not be both?<br>
<br>
There is another Circumstance, which methinks gives us a very high Idea
of the Nature of the Soul, in regard to what passes in Dreams, I mean
that innumerable Multitude and Variety of Ideas which then arise in her.
Were that active watchful Being only conscious of her own Existence at
such a time, what a painful Solitude would her Hours of Sleep be? Were
the Soul sensible of her being alone in her sleeping Moments, after the
same manner that she is sensible of it while awake, the time would hang
very heavy on her, as it often actually does when she Dreams that she is
in such a Solitude?

<blockquote><i>&mdash;Semperque relinqui<br>
  Sola sili, semper longam incomitata videtur<br>
  Ire viam&mdash;</i><br>
<br>
Virg.</blockquote>

But this Observation I only make by the way. What I would here remark,
is that wonderful Power in the Soul, of producing her own Company on
these Occasions. She converses with numberless Beings of her own
Creation, and is transported into ten thousand Scenes of her own
raising. She is herself the Theatre, the Actors, and the Beholder. This
puts me in <a name="fr4872">mind</a> of a Saying which I am infinitely pleased with, and
which <i>Plutarch</i> ascribes to <i>Heraclitus, That all Men whilst they are
awake are in one common World; but that each of them, when he is asleep,
is in a World of his own.</i><a href="#f4872"><sup>2</sup></a>  The waking Man is conversant in the World
of Nature, when he sleeps he retires to a private World that is
particular to himself. There seems something in this Consideration that
intimates to us a natural Grandeur and Perfection in the Soul, which is
rather to be admired than explained.<br>
<br>
I must not <a name="fr4873">omit</a> that Argument for the Excellency of the Soul, which I
have seen quoted out of <i>Tertullian</i><a href="#f4873"><sup>3</sup></a>, namely, its Power of divining
in Dreams. That several such Divinations have been made, none can
question, who believes the Holy Writings, or who has but the least
degree of a common Historical Faith; there being innumerable Instances
of this nature in several Authors, both Antient and Modern, Sacred and
Profane. Whether such dark Presages, such Visions of the Night proceed
from any latent Power in the Soul, during this her state of Abstraction,
or from any Communication with the Supreme Being, or from any operation
of Subordinate Spirits, has been a great Dispute among the Learned; the
matter of Fact is, I think, incontestable, and has been looked upon as
such by the greatest Writers, who have been never suspected either of
Superstition or Enthusiasm.<br>
<br>
I do not suppose, that the Soul in these Instances is entirely loose and
unfettered from the Body: It is sufficient, if she is not so far sunk,
and immersed in Matter, nor intangled and perplexed in her Operations,
with such Motions of Blood and Spirits, as when she actuates the Machine
in its waking Hours. The Corporeal Union is slackned enough to give the
Mind more Play. The Soul seems gathered within herself, and recovers
that Spring which is broke and weakned, when she operates more in
concert with the Body.<br>
<br>
The Speculations I have here made, if they are not Arguments, they are
at least strong Intimations, not only of the Excellency of an Human
Soul, but of its Independence on the Body; and if they do not prove, do
at least confirm these two great Points, which are established by many
other Reasons that are altogether unanswerable.<br>

I find, by several Letters which I receive daily, that many of my
Readers would be better pleased to pay Three Half-Pence for my Paper,
than Two-Pence. The ingenious <i>T. W.</i> tells me, that I have deprived him
of the best Part of his Breakfast, for that since the rise of my Paper,
he is forced every Morning to drink his Dish of Coffee by it self,
without the Addition of the <i>Spectator</i>, that used to be better than
Lace to it. <i>Eugenius</i> informs me very obligingly, that he never thought
he should have disliked any Passage in my Paper, but that of late there
have been two Words in every one of them, which he could heartily wish
left out, <i>viz. Price Two-Pence</i>. I have a Letter from a Soap-boiler,
who condoles with me very affectionately, upon the necessity we both lie
under of setting an higher Price on our Commodities, since the late Tax
has been laid upon them, and de<b>Sir</b> ing me, when I write next on that
Subject, to speak a Word or two upon the present Duties on Castile-Soap.
But there is none of these my Correspondents, who writes with a greater
Turn of good Sense and Elegance of Expression, than the generous
<i>Philomedes</i>, who advises me to value every <i>Spectator</i> at Six Pence,
and promises that he himself will engage for above a Hundred of his
Acquaintance, who shall take it in at that Price.<br>
<br>
Letters from the Female World are likewise come to me, in great
quantities, upon the same Occasion; and as I naturally bear a great
Deference to this Part of our Species, I am very glad to find that those
who approve my Conduct in this Particular, are much more numerous than
those who condemn it. A large Family of Daughters have drawn me up a
very handsome Remonstrance, in which they set forth, that their Father
having refused to take in the<i>Spectator</i>, since the additional Price
was set upon it, they offered him unanimously to bate him the Article of
Bread and Butter in the Tea-Table Account, provided the <i>Spectator</i>
might be served up to them every Morning as usual. Upon this the old
Gentleman, being pleased, it seems, with their De<b>Sir</b> e of improving
themselves, has granted them the continuance both of the <i>Spectator</i> and
their Bread and Butter; having given particular Orders, that the
Tea-Table shall be set forth every Morning with its Customary Bill of
Fare, and without any manner of Defalcation. I thought my self obliged
to mention this Particular, as it does Honour to this worthy Gentleman;
and if the young Lady <i>L&aelig;titia</i>, who sent me this Account, will acquaint
me with his Name, I will insert it at length in one of my Papers, if he
de<b>Sir</b> es it.<br>
<br>
I should be very glad to find out any Expedient that might alleviate the
Expence which this my Paper brings to any of my Readers; and, in order
to it, must propose two Points to their Consideration. First, that if
they retrench any the smallest Particular in their ordinary Expence, it
will easily make up the Half Penny a Day, which we have now under
Consideration. Let a Lady sacrifice but a single Ribband to her Morning
Studies, and it will be sufficient: Let a Family burn but a Candle a
Night less than the usual Number, and they may take in the <i>Spectator</i>
without Detriment to their private Affairs.<br>
<br>
In the next Place, if my Readers will not go to the Price of buying my
Papers by Retail, let them have Patience, and they may buy them in the
Lump, without the Burthen of a Tax upon them. My Speculations, when they
are sold single, like Cherries upon the Stick, are Delights for the Rich
and Wealthy; after some time they come to Market in greater Quantities,
and are every ordinary Man's Money. The Truth of it is, they have a
certain Flavour at their first Appearance, from several accidental
Circumstances of Time, Place and Person, which they may lose if they are
not taken early; but in this case every Reader is to consider, whether
it is not better for him to be half a Year behind-hand with the
fashionable and polite part of the World, than to strain himself beyond
his Circumstances. My Bookseller has now about Ten Thousand of the Third
and Fourth Volumes, which he is ready to publish, having already
disposed of as large an Edition both of the First and Second Volume. As
he is a Person whose Head is very well turned to his Business, he thinks
they would be a very proper Present to be made to Persons at
Christenings, Marriages, Visiting-Days, and the like joyful Solemnities,
as several other Books are frequently given at Funerals. He has printed
them in such a little portable Volume, that many of them may be ranged
together upon a single Plate; and is of Opinion, that a Salver of
<i><b>Spectators</b></i> would be as acceptable an Entertainment to the Ladies, as a
Salver of Sweetmeats.<br>
<br>
I shall conclude this Paper with an Epigram lately sent to the Writer of
the <i>Spectator</i>, after having returned my Thanks to the ingenious Author
of it.

<blockquote>  <i><b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>

<br>
  <i><b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  Upon reading your <i>Essay</i> concerning the Pleasures of the Imagination,
  I find, among the three Sources of those Pleasures which you have
  discovered, <span style="color: #663300;">that</span> <i>Greatness</i> is one. This has suggested to me the
  reason why, of all Objects that I have ever seen, there is none which
  affects my Imagination so much as the Sea or Ocean. I cannot see the
  Heavings of this prodigious Bulk of Waters, even in a Calm, without a
  very pleasing Astonishment; but when it is worked up in a Tempest, so
  that the Horizon on every side is nothing but foaming Billows and
  floating Mountains, it is impossible to describe the agreeable Horrour
  that rises from such a Prospect. A troubled Ocean, to a Man who sails
  upon it, is, I think, the biggest Object that he can see in motion,
  and consequently gives his Imagination one of the highest kinds of
  Pleasure that can arise from Greatness. I must confess, it is
  impossible for me to survey this World of fluid Matter, without
  thinking on the Hand that first poured it out, and made a proper
  Channel for its Reception. Such an Object naturally raises in my
  Thoughts the Idea of an Almighty Being, and convinces me of his
  Existence as much as a metaphysical Demonstration. The Imagination
  prompts the Understanding, and by the Greatness of the sensible
  Object, produces in it the Idea of a Being who is neither
  circumscribed by Time nor Space.<br>
<br>
  As I have made several Voyages upon the Sea, I have often been tossed
  in Storms, and on that occasion have frequently reflected on the
  Descriptions of them in ancient Poets. I remember <i>Longinus</i> highly
  recommends <a name="fr4891">one</a> in <i>Homer</i>, because the Poet has not amused himself
  with little Fancies upon the occasion, as Authors of an inferiour
  Genius, whom he mentions, had done, but because he has gathered
  together those Circumstances which are the most apt to terrify the
  Imagination, and which really happen in the raging of a Tempest<a href="#f4891"><sup>1</sup></a>.
  It is for the same reason, that I prefer <a name="fr4892">the</a> following Description of
  a Ship in a Storm, which the Psalmist has made, before any other I
  have ever met with.

<blockquote><i>They that go down to the Sea in Ships, that do Business in great
    Waters: These see the Works of the Lord, and his Wonders in the
    Deep. For he commandeth and raiseth the stormy Wind, which lifteth
    up the Waters thereof. They mount up to the Heaven, they go down
    again to the Depths, their Soul is melted because of Trouble. They
    reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken Man, and are at their
    Wits End. Then they cry unto the Lord in their Trouble, and he
    bringeth them out of their Distresses. He maketh the Storm a Calm,
    so that the Waves thereof are still. Then they are glad because they
    be quiet, so he bringeth them unto their de<b>Sir</b> ed Haven.</i><a href="#f4892"><sup>2</sup></a></blockquote>

  By the way, how much more comfortable, as well as rational, is this
  System of the Psalmist, than the Pagan Scheme in <i>Virgil</i>, and other
  Poets, where one Deity is represented as raising a Storm, and another
  as laying it? Were we only to consider the Sublime in this Piece of
  Poetry, what can be nobler than the Idea it gives us of the Supreme
  Being thus raising the Tumult among the Elements, and recovering them
  out of their Confusion; thus troubling and becalming Nature?<br>
<br>
  Great Painters do not only give us Landskips of Gardens, Groves, and
  Meadows, but very often employ their Pencils upon Sea-Pieces: I could
  wish you would follow their Example. If this small Sketch may deserve
  a Place among your Works, I <a name="fr4893">shall</a> accompany it with a divine Ode, made
  by a Gentleman<a href="#f4893"><sup>3</sup></a> upon the Conclusion of his Travels.<br>

I have very long entertain'd an Ambition to make the Word <i>Wife</i> the
most agreeable and delightful Name in Nature. If it be not so in it
self, all the wiser Part of Mankind from the Beginning of the World to
this Day has consented in an Error: But our Unhappiness in <i>England</i> has
been, that a few loose Men of Genius for Pleasure, have turn'd it all to
the Gratification of ungovern'd De<b>Sir</b> es, in spite of good Sense, Form
and Order; when, in truth, any Satisfaction beyond the Boundaries of
Reason, is but a Step towards Madness and Folly. But is the Sense of Joy
and Accomplishment of De<b>Sir</b> e no way to be indulged or attain'd? and have
we Appetites given us not to be at all gratify'd? Yes certainly.
Marriage is an Institution calculated for a constant Scene of as much
Delight as our Being is capable of. Two Persons who have chosen each
other out of all the Species, with design to be each other's mutual
Comfort and Entertainment, have in that Action bound themselves to be
good-humour'd, affable, discreet, forgiving, patient and joyful, with
respect to each other's Frailties and Perfections, to the End of their
Lives. The wiser of the two (and it always happens one of them is such)
will for her or his own sake, keep things from Outrage with the utmost
Sanctity. When this Union is thus preserved (as I have often said) the
most indifferent Circumstance administers Delight. Their Condition is an
endless Source of new Gratifications. The married Man can say, If I am
unacceptable to all the World beside, there is one whom I entirely love,
that will receive me with Joy and Transport, and think herself obliged
to double her Kindness and Caresses of me from the Gloom with which she
sees me overcast. I need not dissemble the Sorrow of my Heart to be
agreeable there, that very Sorrow quickens her Affection.<br>
<br>
This Passion towards each other, when once well fixed, enters into the
very Constitution, and the Kindness flows as easily and silently as the
Blood in the Veins. When this Affection is enjoy'd in the most sublime
Degree, unskilful Eyes see nothing of it; but when it is subject to be
chang'd, and has an Allay in it that may make it end in Distaste, it is
apt to break into Rage, or overflow into Fondness, before the rest of
the World.<br>
<br>
<i>Uxander</i> and <i>Viramira</i> are amorous and young, and have been married
these two Years; yet do they so much distinguish each other in Company,
that in your Conversation with the Dear Things you are still put to a
Sort of Cross-Purposes. Whenever you address your self in ordinary
Discourse to <i>Viramira</i>, she turns her Head another way, and the Answer
is made to the dear <i>Uxander</i>: If you tell a merry Tale, the Application
is still directed to her Dear; and when she should commend you, she says
to him, as if he had spoke it, That is, my Dear, so pretty&mdash;This puts
me in mind of what I have somewhere read in the admired Memoirs of the
famous <i>Cervantes</i>, where, while honest <i>Sancho Pana</i> is putting some
necessary humble Question concerning <i>Rozinante</i>, his Supper, or his
Lodgings, the Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance is ever improving the
harmless lowly Hints of his Squire to the poetical Conceit, Rapture and
Flight, in Contemplation of the dear <i>Dulcinea</i> of his Affections.<br>
<br>
On the other side, <i>Dictamnus</i> and <i>Moria</i> are ever squabbling, and you
may observe them all the time they are in Company in a State of
Impatience. As <i>Uxander</i> and <i>Viramira</i> wish you all gone, that they may
be at freedom for Dalliance; <i>Dictamnus</i> and <i>Moria</i> wait your Absence,
that they may speak their harsh Interpretations on each other's Words
and Actions during the time you were with them.<br>
<br>
It is certain that the greater Part of the Evils attending this
Condition of Life, arises from Fashion. Prejudice in this Case is turn'd
the wrong way, and instead of expecting more Happiness than we shall
meet with in it, we are laugh'd into a Prepossession, that we shall be
disappointed if we hope for lasting Satisfactions.<br>
<br>
With all Persons who have made good Sense the Rule of Action, Marriage
is describ'd as the State capable of the highest human Felicity. <i>Tully</i>
has Epistles full of affectionate Pleasure, when he writes to his Wife,
or speaks of his Children. But <a name="fr4901">above</a> all the Hints of this kind I have
met with in Writers of ancient date, I am pleas'd with an Epigram of
<i>Martial</i><a href="#f4901"><sup>1</sup></a> in honour of the Beauty of his Wife <i>Cleopatra</i>.
Commentators say it was written the day after his Wedding-Night. When
his Spouse was retir'd to the Bathing-room in the Heat of the Day, he,
it seems, came in upon her when she was just going into the Water. To
her Beauty and Carriage on this occasion we owe the following Epigram,
which I shew'd my Friend <b>Will. Honeycomb</b> in <i>French</i>, who has translated
it as follows, without understanding the Original. I expect it will
please the <i>English</i> better than the <i>Latin</i> Reader.

<blockquote><i>When my bright Consort, now nor Wife nor Maid,<br>
Asham'd and wanton, of Embrace afraid,<br>
Fled to the Streams, the Streams my Fair betray'd;<br>
To my fond Eyes she all transparent stood,<br>
She blush'd, I smil'd at the slight covering Flood.<br>
Thus thro' the Glass the Lovely Lilly glows,<br>
Thus thro' the ambient Gem shines forth the Rose.<br>
I saw new Charms, and plung'd to seize my Store,<br>
Kisses I snatch'd, the Waves prevented more.</i></blockquote>

My Friend would not allow that this luscious Account could be given of a
Wife, and therefore used the Word <i>Consort</i>; which, he learnedly said,
would serve for a Mistress as well, and give a more Gentlemanly Turn to
the Epigram. But, under favour of him and all other such fine Gentlemen,
I cannot be persuaded but that the Passion a Bridegroom has for a
virtuous young Woman, will, <a name="fr4902">by</a> little and little, grow into Friendship,
and then it is ascended to <span style="color: #663300;">a</span><a href="#f4902"><sup>2</sup></a> higher Pleasure than it was in its
first Fervour. Without this happens, he is a very unfortunate Man who
has enter'd into this State, and left the Habitudes of Life he might
have enjoy'd with a faithful Friend. But when the Wife proves capable of
filling serious as well as joyous Hours, she brings Happiness unknown to
Friendship itself. <i>Spencer</i> <a name="fr4903">speaks</a> of each kind of Love with great
Justice, and attributes the highest Praise to Friendship; and indeed
there is no disputing that Point, but by making that Friendship take
<span style="color: #663300;">Place</span><a href="#f4903"><sup>3</sup></a> between two married Persons.

<blockquote><i>Hard is the Doubt, and difficult to deem,<br>
When all three kinds of Love together meet,<br>
And to dispart the Heart with Power extreme,<br>
Whether shall weigh the Ballance down; to wit,<br>
The dear Affection unto Kindred sweet,<br>
Or raging Fire of Love to Womenkind,<br>
Or Zeal of Friends combin'd by Virtues meet.<br>
But, of them all, the Band of virtuous Mind<br>
Methinks the gentle Heart should most assured bind.<br><br>

For natural Affection soon doth cease,<br>
And quenched is with</i> Cupid's <i>greater Flame;<br>
But faithful Friendship doth them both suppress,<br>
And them with mastering Discipline does tame,<br>
Through Thoughts aspiring to eternal Fame.<br>
For as the Soul doth rule the Earthly Mass,<br>
And all the Service of the Body frame;<br>
So Love of Soul doth Love of Body pass,<br>
No less than perfect Gold surmounts the meanest Brass.</i></blockquote>

It is common with me to run from Book to Book to exercise my Mind with
many Objects, and qualify my self for my daily Labours. After an Hour
spent in this loitering Way of Reading, something will remain to be Food
to the Imagination. The Writings that please me most on such Occasions
are Stories, for the Truth of which there is good Authority. The Mind of
Man is naturally a Lover of Justice, and when we read a Story wherein a
Criminal is overtaken, in whom there is no Quality which is the Object
of Pity, the Soul enjoys a certain Revenge for the Offence done to its
Nature, in the wicked Actions committed in the preceding Part of the
History. <a name="fr4911">This</a> will be better understood by the Reader from the following
Narration<a href="#f4911"><sup>1</sup></a> it self, than from any thing which I can say to introduce
it.<br>
<br>
When <i>Charles</i> Duke of <i>Burgundy</i>, surnamed <i>The Bold</i>, reigned over
spacious Dominions now swallowed up by the Power of <i>France</i>, he heaped
many Favours and Honours upon <i>Claudius Rhynsault</i>, a <i>German</i>, who had
serv'd him in his Wars against the Insults of his Neighbours. A great
part of <i>Zealand</i> was at that time in Subjection to that Dukedom. The
Prince himself was a Person of singular Humanity and Justice.
<i>Rhynsault</i>, with no other real Quality than Courage, had Dissimulation
enough to pass upon his generous and unsuspicious Master for a Person of
blunt Honesty and Fidelity, without any Vice that could bias him from
the Execution of Justice. His Highness prepossessed to his Advantage,
upon the Decease of the Governour of his chief Town of <i>Zealand</i>, gave
<i>Rhynsault</i> that Command. He was not long seated in that Government,
before he cast his Eyes upon <i>Sapphira</i>, a Woman of Exquisite Beauty,
the Wife of <i>Paul Danvelt</i>, a wealthy Merchant of the City under his
Protection and Government. <i>Rhynsault</i> was a Man of a warm Constitution,
and violent Inclination to Women, and not unskilled in the soft Arts
which win their Favour. He knew what it was to enjoy the Satisfactions
which are reaped from the Possession of Beauty, but was an utter
Stranger to the Decencies, Honours and Delicacies that attend the
Passion towards them in elegant Minds. However he had so much of the
World, that he had a great share of the Language which usually prevails
upon the weaker Part of that Sex, and he could with his Tongue utter a
Passion with which his Heart was wholly untouch'd. He was one of those
brutal Minds which can be gratified with the Violation of Innocence and
Beauty, without the least Pity, Passion or Love to that with which they
are so much delighted. Ingratitude is a Vice inseparable to a lustful
Man; and the Possession of a Woman by him who has no thought but
allaying a Passion painful to himself, is necessarily followed by
Distaste and Aversion. <i>Rhynsault</i> being resolv'd to accomplish his Will
on the Wife of <i>Danvelt</i>, left no Arts untried to get into a Familiarity
at her House; but she knew his Character and Disposition too well, not
to shun all Occasions that might ensnare her into his Conversation. The
Governor despairing of Success by ordinary Means, apprehended and
Imprisoned her Husband, under pretence of an Information that he was
guilty of a Correspondence with the Enemies of the Duke, to betray the
Town into their Possession. This Design had its de<b>Sir</b> ed Effect; and the
Wife of the unfortunate <i>Danvelt</i>, the day before that which was
appointed for his Execution, presented herself in the Hall of the
Governor's House, and as he pass'd thro' the Apartment, threw her self
at his Feet, and holding his Knees, beseeched his Mercy. <i>Rhynsault</i>
beheld her with a dissembled Satisfaction, and assuming an Air of
Thought and Authority, he bid her arise, and told her she must follow
him to his Closet; and asking her whether she knew the Hand of the
Letter he pulled out of his Pocket, went from her, leaving this
Admonition aloud, <i>If you will save your Husband, you must give me an
account of all you know without Prevarication; for every body is
satisfied he was too fond of you to be able to hide from you the Names
of the rest of the Conspirators, or any other Particulars whatsoever</i>.
He went to his Closet, and soon after the Lady was sent to for an
Audience. The Servant knew his distance when Matters of State were to be
debated; and the Governor, laying aside the Air with which he had
appear'd in publick, began to be the Supplicant, to rally an Affliction,
which it was in her Power easily to remove, and relieve an innocent Man
from his Imprisonment. She easily perceiv'd his Intention, and, bathed
in Tears, began to deprecate so wicked a Design. Lust, like Ambition,
takes all the Faculties of the Mind and Body into its Service and
Subjection. Her becoming Tears, her honest Anguish, the wringing of her
Hands, and the many Changes of her Posture and Figure in the Vehemence
of speaking, were but so many Attitudes in which he beheld her Beauty,
and further Incentives of his De<b>Sir</b> e. All Humanity was lost in that one
Appetite, and he signified to her in so many plain Terms, that he was
unhappy till he had possess'd her, and nothing less shou'd be the Price
of her Husband's Life; and she must, before the following Noon,
pronounce the Death or Enlargement of <i>Danvelt</i>. After this
Notification, when he saw <i>Sapphira</i> enough again distracted to make the
Subject of their Discourse to common Eyes appear different from what it
was, he called Servants to conduct her to the Gate. Loaded with
insupportable Affliction, she immediately repairs to her Husband, and
having signified to his Gaolers, that she had a Proposal to make to her
Husband from the Governor, she was left alone with him, reveal'd to him
all that had pass'd, and represented the endless Conflict she was in
between Love to his Person, and Fidelity to his Bed. It is easie to
imagine the sharp Affliction this honest Pair was in upon such an
Incident, in Lives not us'd to any but ordinary Occurrences. The Man was
bridled by Shame from speaking what his Fear prompted, upon so near an
approach of Death; but let fall Words that signify'd to her, he should
not think her polluted, though she had not yet confess'd to him that the
Governor had violated her Person, since he knew her Will had no part in
the Action. She parted from him with this oblique Permission to save a
Life he had not Resolution enough to resign for the safety of his
Honour.<br>
<br>
The next Morning the unhappy <i>Sapphira</i> attended the Governor, and being
led into a remote Apartment, submitted to his De<b>Sir</b> es. <i>Rhynsault</i>
commended her Charms, claim'd a Familiarity after what had pass'd
between them, and with an Air of Gaiety in the Language of a Gallant,
bid her return, and take her Husband out of Prison: But, continu'd he,
my Fair one must not be offended that I have taken care he should not be
an Interruption to our future Assignations. These last Words foreboded
what she found when she came to the Gaol, her Husband executed by the
Order of <i>Rhynsault.</i><br>
<br>
It was remarkable that the Woman, who was full of Tears and Lamentations
during the whole Course of her Affliction, uttered neither Sigh nor
Complaint, but stood fix'd with Grief at this Consummation of her
Misfortunes. She betook herself to her abode, and after having in
Solitude paid her Devotions to him who is the Avenger of Innocence, she
repair'd privately to Court. Her Person and a certain Grandeur of Sorrow
negligent of Forms gain'd her Passage into the Presence of the Duke her
Sovereign. As soon as she came into the Presence, she broke forth into
the following words, <i>Behold, O mighty</i> Charles, <i>a Wretch weary of
Life, though it has always been spent with Innocence and Virtue. It is
not in your power to redress my Injuries, but it is to avenge them. And
if the Protection of the Distress'd, and the Punishment of Oppressors,
is a Task worthy a Prince, I bring the Duke of</i> Burgundy <i>ample matter
for doing Honour to his own great Name, and wiping Infamy off of mine.</i><br>
<br>
When she had spoke this, she deliver'd the Duke a Paper reciting her
Story. He read it with all the Emotions that Indignation and Pity could
raise in a Prince jealous of his Honour in the Behaviour of his
Officers, and Prosperity of his Subjects.<br>
<br>
Upon an appointed Day, <i>Rhynsault</i> was sent for to Court, and in the
Presence of a few of the Council, confronted by <i>Sapphira</i>: the Prince
asking, <i>Do you know that Lady? Rhynsault</i>, as soon as he could
recover his Surprize, told the Duke he would marry her, if his Highness
would please to think that a Reparation. The Duke seem'd contented with
this Answer, and stood by during the immediate Solemnization of the
Ceremony. At the Conclusion of it he told <i>Rhynsault, Thus far have you
done as constrain'd by my Authority: I shall not be satisfied of your
kind Usage of her, without you sign a Gift of your whole Estate to her
after your Decease</i>. To the Performance of this also the Duke was a
Witness. When these two Acts were executed, the Duke turn'd to the Lady,
and told her, it now remains for me to put you in quiet Possession of
what your Husband has so bountifully bestow'd on you; and order'd the
immediate Execution of <i>Rhynsault</i>.<br>

<br>
  <i>Tunbridge, Sept. 18.<br>
<br>
  Dear Mr. </i>SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'I am a young Woman of Eighteen Years of Age, and, I do assure you, a
  Maid of unspotted Reputation, founded upon a very careful Carriage in
  all my Looks, Words and Actions. At the same time I must own to you,
  that it is with much constraint to Flesh and Blood that my Behaviour
  is so strictly irreproachable; for I am naturally addicted to Mirth,
  to Gaiety, to a Free Air, to Motion and Gadding. Now what gives me a
  great deal of Anxiety, and is some Discouragement in the Pursuit of
  Virtue, is, that the young Women who run into greater Freedoms with
  the Men are more taken Notice of than I am. The Men are such
  unthinking Sots, that they do not prefer her who restrains all her
  Passions and Affections and keeps much within the Bounds of what is
  lawful, to her who goes to the utmost Verge of Innocence, and parlies
  at the very Brink of Vice, whether she shall be a Wife or a Mistress.
  But I must appeal to your Spectatorial Wisdom, who, I find, have
  passed very much of your Time in the Study of Woman, whether this is
  not a most unreasonable Proceeding. I have read somewhere, that
  <i>Hobbes</i> of <i>Malmesbury</i> asserts, that continent Persons have more of
  what they contain, than those who give a loose to their De<b>Sir</b> es.
  According to this Rule, let there be equal Age, equal Wit, and equal
  Good-Humour, in the Woman of Prudence, and her of Liberty; what Stores
  has he to expect, who takes the former? What Refuse must he be
  contented with, who chuses the latter? Well, but I sate down to write
  to you to vent my Indignation against several pert Creatures who are
  address'd to and courted in this Place, while poor I, and two or three
  like me, are wholly unregarded.<br>
<br>
  Every one of these affect gaining the Hearts of your Sex: This is
  generally attempted by a particular manner of carrying themselves with
  Familiarity. <i>Glycera</i> has a dancing Walk, and keeps Time in her
  ordinary Gate. <i>Chloe</i>, her Sister, who is unwilling to interrupt her
  Conquests, comes into the Room before her with a familiar Run.
  <i>Dulcissa</i> takes Advantage of the Approach of the Winter, and has
  introduc'd a very pretty Shiver; closing up her Shoulders, and
  shrinking as she moves. All that are in this Mode carry their Fans
  between both Hands before them. <i>Dulcissa</i> herself, who is Author of
  this Air, adds the pretty Run to it; and has also, when she is in very
  good Humour, a taking Familiarity in throwing herself into the lowest
  Seat in the Room, and letting her hoop'd Petticoats fall with a lucky
  Decency about her. I know she practices this way of sitting down in
  her Chamber; and indeed she does it as well as you may have seen an
  Actress fall down dead in a Tragedy. Not the least Indecency in her
  Posture. If you have observ'd what pretty Carcasses are carry'd off at
  the end of a Verse at the Theatre, it will give you a Notion how
  <i>Dulcissa</i> plumps into a Chair. Here's a little Country Girl that's
  very cunning, that makes her use of being young and unbred, and
  outdoes the Insnarers, who are almost twice her Age. The Air that she
  takes is to come into Company after a Walk, and is very successfully
  out of Breath upon occasion. Her Mother is in the Secret, and calls
  her Romp, and then looks round to see what young Men stare at her.<br>
<br>
  It would take up more than can come into one of your Papers, to
  enumerate all the particular Airs of the younger Company in this
  Place. But I cannot omit <i>Dulceorella</i>, whose manner is the most
  indolent imaginable, but still as watchful of Conquest as the busiest
  Virgin among us. She has a peculiar Art of staring at a young Fellow,
  till she sees she has got him, and inflam'd him by so much
  Observation. When she sees she has him, and he begins to toss his Head
  upon it, she is immediately short-sighted, and labours to observe what
  he is at a distance with her Eyes half shut. Thus the Captive, that
  thought her first struck, is to make very near Approaches, or be
  wholly disregarded. This Artifice has done more Execution than all the
  ogling of the rest of the Women here, with the utmost Variety of half
  Glances, attentive Heedlessnesses, childish Inadvertencies, haughty
  Contempts, or artificial Oversights. After I have said thus much of
  Ladies among us who fight thus regularly, I am to complain to you of a
  Set of Familiar Romps, who have broken thro' all common Rules, and
  have thought of a very effectual way of shewing more Charms than all
  of us. These, Mr. SPECTATOR, are the Swingers. You are to know these
  careless pretty Creatures are very Innocents again; and it is to be no
  matter what they do, for 'tis all harmless Freedom. They get on Ropes,
  as you must have seen the Children, and are swung by their Men
  Visitants. The Jest is, that Mr. such a one can name the Colour of
  Mrs. Such-a-one's Stockings; and she tells him, he is a lying Thief,
  so he is, and full of Roguery; and she'll lay a Wager, and her Sister
  shall tell the Truth if he says right, and he can't tell what Colour
  her Garters are of. In this Diversion there are very many pretty
  Shrieks, not so much for fear of falling, as that their Petticoats
  shou'd untye: For there is a great care had to avoid Improprieties;
  and the Lover who swings the Lady, is to tye her Clothes very close
  with his Hatband, before she admits him to throw up her Heels.<br>
<br>
  'Now, <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR, except you can note these Wantonnesses in their
  Beginnings, and bring us sober Girls into Observation, there is no
  help for it, we must swim with the Tide; the Coquets are too powerful
  a Party for us. To look into the Merit of a regular and well-behav'd
  Woman, is a slow thing. A loose trivial Song gains the Affections,
  when a wise Homily is not attended to. There is no other way but to
  make war upon them, or we must go over to them. As for my Part, I will
  shew all the World it is not for want of Charms that I stand so long
  unasked; and if you do not take measures for the immediate Redress of
  us Rigids, as the Fellows call us, I can move with a speaking Mien,
  can look significantly, can lisp, can trip, can loll, can start, can
  blush, can rage, can weep, if I must do it, and can be frighted as
  agreeably as any She in <i>England</i>. All which is humbly submitted to
  your Spectatorial Consideration with all Humility, by<br>
<br>
  <i>Your most humble Servant</i>,<br>
<br>
  Matilda Mohair.</blockquote>

<br>

It is no unpleasant matter of Speculation to consider the recommendatory
Epistles that pass round this Town from Hand to Hand, and the abuse
People put upon one another in that kind. It is indeed come to that
pass, that instead of being the Testimony of Merit in the Person
recommended, the true reading of a Letter of this sort is, 

 <blockquote><i> The Bearer hereof is so uneasie to me, that it will be an Act of
  Charity in you to take him off my Hands; whether you prefer him or
  not, it is all one, for I have no manner of Kindness for him, or
  Obligation to him or his; and do what you please as to that.</i></blockquote>

As negligent as Men are in this respect, a point of Honour is concerned
in it; and there is nothing a Man should be more ashamed of, than
passing a worthless Creature into the Service or Interests of a Man who
has never injured you. The Women indeed are a little too keen in their
Resentments, to trespass often this Way: But you shall sometimes know
that the Mistress and the Maid shall quarrel, and give each other very
free Language, and at last the Lady shall be pacified to turn her out of
Doors, and give her a very good Word to any body else. Hence it is that
you see, in a Year and Half's time, the same Face a Domestick in all
parts of the Town. Good-breeding and Good-nature lead People in a great
Measure to this Injustice: When Suitors of no Consideration will have
Confidence enough to press upon their Superiors, those in Power are
tender of speaking the Exceptions they have against them, and are
mortgaged into Promises out of their Impatience of Importunity. In this
latter Case, it would be a very useful Enquiry to know the History of
Recommendations: There are, you must know, certain Abettors of this way
of Torment, who make it a Profession to manage the Affairs of
Candidates: These Gentlemen let out their Impudence to their Clients,
and supply any Defective Recommendation, by informing how such and such
a Man is to be attacked. They will tell you, get the least Scrap from
Mr. Such-a-one, and leave the rest to them. When one of these
Undertakers have your Business in hand, you may be sick, absent in Town
or Country, and the Patron shall be worried, or you prevail. I remember
to have been shewn a Gentleman some Years ago, who punish'd a whole
People for their Facility in giving their Credentials. This Person had
belonged to a Regiment which did Duty in the <i>West-Indies</i>, and by the
Mortality of the Place happened to be commanding Officer in the Colony.
He oppressed his Subjects with great frankness, till he became sensible
that he was heartily hated by every Man under his Command. When he had
carried his Point, to be thus detestable, in a pretended Fit of
Dishumour, and feigned Uneasiness of living where he found he was so
universally unacceptable, he communicated to the chief Inhabitants a
Design he had to return for <i>England</i>, provided they would give him
ample Testimonials of their Approbation. The Planters came into it to a
Man; and in proportion to his deserving the quite contrary, the Words
Justice, Generosity, and Courage, were inserted in his Commission, not
omitting the general Good-liking of People of all Conditions in the
Colony. The Gentleman returns for <i>England</i>, and within few Months after
came back to them their Governour on the Strength of their own
Testimonials.<br>
<br>
Such a Rebuke as this cannot indeed happen to easy Recommenders, in the
ordinary course of things from one hand to another; but how would a Man
bear to have it said to him, the Person I took into Confidence on the
Credit you gave him, has proved false, unjust, and has not answered any
way the Character you gave me of him?<br>
<br>
I cannot but conceive very good hopes of that Rake <i>Jack Toper</i> of the
<i>Temple</i>, for an honest Scrupulousness in this Point. A Friend of his
meeting with a Servant that had formerly lived with <i>Jack</i>, and having a
mind to take him, sent to him to know what Faults the Fellow had, since
he could not please such a careless Fellow as he was. His Answer was as
follows:

<blockquote>  <i><b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  'Thomas that lived with me was turned away because he was too good for
  me. You know I live in Taverns; he is an orderly sober Rascal, and
  thinks much to sleep in an Entry till two in a Morning. He told me one
  day when he was dressing me, that he wondered I was not dead before
  now, since I went to Dinner in the Evening, and went to Supper at two
  in the Morning. We were coming down <i>Essex-street</i> one Night a little
  flustrated, and I was giving him the Word to alarm the Watch; he had
  the Impudence to tell me it was against the Law. You that are married,
  and live one Day after another the same Way, and so on the whole Week,
  I dare say will like him, and he will be glad to have his Meat in due
  Season. The Fellow is certainly very Honest. My Service to your Lady.<br>
<br>
  <i>Yours</i>, J. T.</blockquote>

Now this was very fair Dealing. <i>Jack</i> knew very well, that though the
Love of Order made a Man very awkward in his Equipage, it was a valuable
Quality among the Queer People who live by Rule; and had too much good
Sense and good Nature to let the Fellow starve, because he was not fit
to attend his Vivacities.<br>
<br>
I shall end this Discourse with a Letter of Recommendation from <i>Horace</i>
to <i>Claudius Nero</i>. You will see in that Letter a Slowness to ask a
Favour, a strong Reason for being unable to deny his good Word any
longer, and that it is a Service to the Person to whom he recommends, to
comply with what is asked: All which are necessary Circumstances, both
in Justice and Good-breeding, if a Man would ask so as to have reason to
complain of a Denial; and indeed a Man should not in strictness ask
otherwise. In hopes <a name="fr4931">the</a> Authority of <i>Horace</i>, who perfectly understood
how to live with great Men, may have a good Effect towards amending this
Facility in People of Condition, and the Confidence of those who apply
to them without Merit, I have translated the Epistle<a href="#f4931"><sup>1</sup></a>.

<blockquote>  <i>To</i> <b>Claudius Nero.</b><br>
<br>
  <i><b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  '<i>Septimus</i>, who waits upon you with this, is very well acquainted
  with the place you are pleased to allow me in your Friendship. For
  when he beseeches me to recommend him to your Notice, in such a manner
  as to be received by you, who are delicate in the choice of your
  Friends and Domesticks, he knows our Intimacy, and understands my
  Ability to serve him better than I do myself. I have defended my self
  against his Ambition to be yours, as long as I possibly could; but
  fearing the Imputation of hiding my Power in you out of mean and
  selfish Considerations, I am at last prevailed upon to give you this
  Trouble. Thus, to avoid the Appearance of a greater Fault, I have put
  on this Confidence. If you can forgive this Transgression of Modesty
  in behalf of a Friend, receive this Gentleman into your Interests and
  Friendship, and take it from me that he is an honest and brave Man.  </blockquote>

<br>

About an Age ago it was the fashion in <i>England</i>, for every one that
would be thought religious, to throw as much Sanctity as possible into
his Face, and in particular to abstain from all Appearances of Mirth and
Pleasantry, which were looked upon as the Marks of a Carnal Mind. The
Saint was of a sorrowful Countenance, and generally eaten up with Spleen
and Melancholy. A <a name="fr4941">Gentleman</a>, who was lately a great Ornament to the
Learned World<a href="#f4941"><sup>1</sup></a>, has diverted me more than once with an Account of the
Reception <a name="fr4942">which</a> he met with from a very famous Independent Minister, who
was Head of a College in those times<a href="#f4942"><sup>2</sup></a>. This Gentleman was then a
young Adventurer in the Republick of Letters, and just fitted out for
the University with a good Cargo of <i>Latin</i> and <i>Greek</i>. His Friends
were resolved that he should try his Fortune at an Election which was
drawing near in the College, of which the Independent Minister whom I
have before mentioned was Governor. The Youth, according to Custom,
waited on him in order to be examined. He was received at the Door by a
Servant, who was one of that gloomy Generation that were then in
fashion. He conducted him, with great Silence and Seriousness, to a long
Gallery which was darkned at Noon-day, and had only a single Candle
burning in it. After a short stay in this melancholy Apartment, he was
led into a Chamber hung with Black, where he entertained himself for
some time by the glimmering of a Taper, till at length the Head of the
College came out to him, from an inner Room, with half a Dozen Night
Caps upon his Head, and a religious Horror in his Countenance. The young
Man trembled; but his Fears encreased when, instead of being ask'd what
Progress he had made in Learning, he was examined how he abounded in
Grace. His <i>Latin</i> and <i>Greek</i> stood him in little stead; he was to give
an account only of the state of his Soul, whether he was of the Number
of the Elect; what was the Occasion of his Conversion; upon what Day of
the Month, and Hour of the Day it happened; how it was carried on, and
when compleated. The whole Examination was summed up with one short
Question, namely, <i>Whether he was prepared for Death?</i> The Boy, who had
been bred up by honest Parents, was frighted out of his Wits at the
Solemnity of the Proceeding, and by the last dreadful Interrogatory; so
that upon making his Escape out of this House of Mourning, he could
never be brought a second time to the Examination, as not being able to
go through the Terrors of it.<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding this general Form and Outside of Religion is pretty well
worn out among us, there are many Persons, who, by a natural
Unchearfulness of Heart, mistaken Notions of Piety, or Weakness of
Understanding, love to indulge this uncomfortable way of Life, and give
up themselves a Prey to Grief and Melancholy. Superstitious Fears and
groundless Scruples cut them off from the Pleasures of Conversation, and
all those social Entertainments, which are not only innocent, but
laudable; as if Mirth was made for Reprobates, and Chearfulness of Heart
denied those who are the only Persons that have a proper Title to it.<br>
<br>
<i>Sombrius</i> is one of these Sons of Sorrow. He thinks himself obliged in
Duty to be sad and disconsolate. He looks on a sudden fit of Laughter as
a Breach of his Baptismal Vow. An innocent Jest startles him like
Blasphemy. Tell him of one who is advanced to a Title of Honour, he
lifts up his Hands and Eyes; describe a publick Ceremony, he shakes his
Head; shew him a gay Equipage, he blesses himself. All the little
Ornaments of Life are Pomps and Vanities. Mirth is wanton, and Wit
profane. He is scandalized at Youth for being lively, and at Childhood
for being playful. He sits at a Christening, or a Marriage Feast, as at
a Funeral; sighs at the Conclusion of a merry Story, and grows devout
when the rest of the Company grow pleasant. After all, <i>Sombrius</i> is a
religious Man, and would have behaved himself very properly, had he
lived when Christianity was under a general Persecution.<br>
<br>
I would by no means presume to tax such Characters with Hypocrisy, as is
done too frequently; that being a Vice which I think none but He, who
knows the Secrets of Men's Hearts, should pretend to discover in
another, where the Proofs of it do not amount to a Demonstration. On the
contrary, as there are many excellent Persons, who are weighed down by
this habitual Sorrow of Heart, they rather deserve our Compassion than
our Reproaches. I think, however, they would do well to consider,
whether such a Behaviour does not deter Men from a Religious Life, by
representing it as an unsociable State, that extinguishes all Joy and
Gladness, darkens the Face of Nature, and destroys the Relish of Being
it self.<br>
<br>
I have, in former Papers, shewn how great a Tendency there is to
Chearfulness in Religion, and how such a Frame of Mind is not only the
most lovely, but the most commendable in a virtuous Person. In short,
those who represent Religion in so unamiable a Light, are like the Spies
sent by <i>Moses</i> to make a Discovery of the Land of <i>Promise</i>, when by
their Reports they discouraged the People from entering upon it. Those
who shew us the Joy, the Chearfulness, the Good-humour, that naturally
spring up in this happy State, are like the Spies bringing along with
them the Clusters of Grapes, and delicious Fruits, that might invite
their Companions into the pleasant Country which produced them.<br>
<br>
<a name="fr4943">An</a> eminent Pagan Writer<a href="#f4943"><sup>3</sup></a> has made a Discourse, to shew that the
Atheist, who denies a God, does him less Dishonour than the Man who owns
his Being, but at the same time believes him to be cruel, hard to
please, and terrible to Human Nature. For my own part, says he, I would
rather it should be said of me, that there was never any such Man as
<i>Plutarch</i>, than that <i>Plutarch</i> was ill-natured, capricious, or inhuman.<br>
<br>
If we may believe our Logicians, Man is distinguished from all other
Creatures by the Faculty of Laughter. He has an Heart capable of Mirth,
and naturally disposed to it. It is not the Business of Virtue to
extirpate the Affections of the Mind, but to regulate them. It may
moderate and restrain, but was not designed to banish Gladness from the
Heart of Man. Religion contracts the Circle of our Pleasures, but leaves
it wide enough for her Votaries to expatiate in. The Contemplation of
the Divine Being, and the Exercise of Virtue, are in their own Nature so
far from excluding all Gladness of Heart, that they are perpetual
Sources of it. In a word, the true Spirit of Religion cheers, as well as
composes the Soul; it banishes indeed all Levity of Behaviour, all
vicious and dissolute Mirth, but in exchange fills the Mind with a
perpetual Serenity, uninterrupted Chearfulness, and an habitual
Inclination to please others, as well as to be pleased in it self.<br>

<br>

As I am one, who, by my Profession, am obliged to look into all kinds of
Men, there are none whom I consider with so much Pleasure, as those who
have any thing new or extraordinary in their Characters, or Ways of
living. For this reason I have often amused my self with Speculations on
the Race of People called <i>Jews</i>, many of whom I have met with in most
of the considerable Towns which I have passed through in the Course of
my Travels. They are, indeed, so disseminated through all the trading
parts of the World, that they are become the Instruments by which the
most distant Nations converse with one another, and by which Mankind are
knit together in a general Correspondence: They are like the Pegs and
Nails in a great Building, which, though they are but little valued in
themselves, are absolutely necessary to keep the whole Frame together.<br>
<br>
That I may not fall into any common beaten Tracks of Observation, I
shall consider this People in three Views: First, with regard to their
Number; Secondly, their Dispersion; and, Thirdly, their Adherence to
their Religion: and afterwards endeavour to shew, First, what Natural
Reasons, and, Secondly, what Providential Reasons may be assigned for
these three remarkable Particulars.<br>
<br>
The <i>Jews</i> are looked upon by many to be as numerous at present, as they
were formerly in the Land of <i>Canaan</i>.<br>
<br>
This is wonderful, considering the dreadful Slaughter made of them under
some of the <i>Roman</i> Emperors, which Historians describe by the Death of
many Hundred Thousands in a War; and the innumerable Massacres and
Persecutions they have undergone in <i>Turkey</i>, as well as in all
Christian Nations of the World. The <i>Rabbins</i>, to express the great
Havock which has been sometimes made of them, tell us, after their usual
manner of Hyperbole, that there were such Torrents of Holy Blood shed as
carried Rocks of an hundred Yards in Circumference above three Miles
into the Sea.<br>
<br>
Their Dispersion is the second remarkable Particular in this People.
They swarm over all the <i>East</i>; and are settled in the remotest Parts of
<i>China</i>: They are spread through most of the Nations of <i>Europe</i> and
<i>Africk</i>, and many Families of them are established in the
<i>West-Indies</i>: not to mention whole Nations bordering on
<i>Prester-John's</i> Country, and some discovered in the inner Parts of
<i>America</i>, if we may give any Credit to their own Writers.<br>
<br>
Their firm Adherence to their Religion, is no less remarkable than their
Numbers and Dispersion, especially considering it as persecuted or
contemned over the Face of the whole Earth. This is likewise the more
remarkable, if we consider the frequent Apostacies of this People, when
they lived under their Kings, in the Land of <i>Promise</i>, and within sight
of their Temple.<br>
<br>
If in the next place we examine, what may be the Natural Reasons for
these three Particulars which we find in the <i>Jews</i>, and which are not
to be found in any other Religion or People, I can, in the first place,
attribute their Numbers to nothing but their constant Employment, their
Abstinence, their Exemption from Wars, and above all, their frequent
Marriages; for they look on Celibacy as an accursed State, and generally
are married before Twenty, as hoping the <i>Messiah</i> may descend from them.<br>
<br>
The Dispersion of the <i>Jews</i> into all the Nations of the Earth, is the
second remarkable Particular of that People, though not so hard to be
accounted for. They were always in Rebellions and Tumults while they had
the Temple and Holy City in View, for which reason they have often been
driven out of their old Habitations in the Land of <i>Promise</i>. They have
as often been banished out of most other Places where they have settled,
which must very much disperse and scatter a People, and oblige them to
seek a Livelihood where they can find it. Besides, the whole People is
now a Race of such Merchants as are Wanderers by Profession, and at the
same time, are in most if not all Places incapable of either Lands or
Offices, that might engage them to make any Part of the World their
Home.<br>
<br>
This Dispersion would probably have lost their Religion, had it not been
secured by the Strength of its Constitution: For they are to live all in
a Body, and generally within the same Enclosure; to marry among
themselves, and to eat no Meats that are not killed or prepared their
own way. This shuts them out from all Table Conversation, and the most
agreeable Intercourses of Life; and, by consequence, excludes them from
the most probable Means of Conversion.<br>
<br>
If, in the last place, we consider what Providential Reason may be
assigned for these three Particulars, we shall find that their Numbers,
Dispersion, and Adherence to their Religion, have furnished every Age,
and every Nation of the World, with the strongest Arguments for the
Christian Faith, not only as these very Particulars are foretold of
them, but as they themselves are the Depositaries of these and all the
other Prophecies, which tend to their own Confusion. Their Number
furnishes us with a sufficient Cloud of Witnesses that attest the Truth
of the Old Bible. Their Dispersion spreads these Witnesses thro' all
parts of the World. The Adherence to their Religion makes their
Testimony unquestionable. Had the whole Body of the <i>Jews</i> been
converted to Christianity, we should certainly have thought all the
Prophecies of the old Testament, that relate to the Coming and History
of our Blessed Saviour, forged by Christians, and have looked upon them,
with the Prophecies of the <i>Sybils</i>, as made many Years after the Events
they pretended to foretell.<br>

  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'Those Ancients who were the most accurate in their Remarks on the
  Genius and Temper of Mankind, by considering the various Bent and
  Scope of our Actions throughout the Progress of Life, have with great
  Exactness allotted Inclinations and Objects of De<b>Sir</b> e particular to
  every Stage, according to the different Circumstances of our
  Conversation and Fortune, thro' the several Periods of it. Hence they
  were disposed easily to excuse those Excesses which might possibly
  arise from a too eager Pursuit of the Affections more immediately
  proper to each State: They indulged the Levity of Childhood with
  Tenderness, overlooked the Gayety of Youth with Good-nature, tempered
  the forward Ambition and Impatience of ripen'd Manhood with
  Discretion, and kindly imputed the tenacious Avarice of old Men to
  their want of relish for any other Enjoyment. Such Allowances as these
  were no less advantageous to common Society than obliging to
  particular Persons; for by maintaining a Decency and Regularity in the
  Course of Life, they supported the Dignity of human Nature, which then
  suffers the greatest Violence when the Order of things is inverted;
  and in nothing is it more remarkably vilify'd and ridiculous, than
  when Feebleness preposterously attempts to adorn it self with that
  outward Pomp and Lustre, which serve only to set off the Bloom of
  Youth with better advantage. I was insensibly carried into Reflections
  of this nature, by just now meeting <i>Paulino</i> (who is in his
  Climacterick) bedeck'd with the utmost Splendour of Dress and
  Equipage, and giving an unbounded Loose to all manner of Pleasure,
  whilst his only Son is debarr'd all innocent Diversion, and may be
  seen frequently solacing himself in the <i>Mall</i> with no other
  Attendance than one antiquated Servant of his Father's for a Companion
  and Director.<br>
<br>
  'It is a monstrous want of Reflection, that a Man cannot consider,
  that when he cannot resign the Pleasures of Life in his Decay of
  Appetite and Inclination to them, his Son must have a much uneasier
  Task to resist the Impetuosity of growing De<b>Sir</b> es. The Skill therefore
  should, methinks, be to let a Son want no lawful Diversion, in
  proportion to his future Fortune, and the Figure he is to make in the
  World. The first Step towards Virtue that I have observed in young Men
  of Condition that have run into Excesses, has been that they had a
  regard to their Quality and Reputation in the Management of their
  Vices. Narrowness in their Circumstances has made many Youths, to
  supply themselves as Debauchees, commence Cheats and Rascals. The
  Father who allows his Son to his utmost ability avoids this latter
  Evil, which as to the World is much greater than the former. But the
  contrary Practice has prevail'd so much among some Men, that I have
  known them deny them what was merely necessary for Education suitable
  to their Quality. Poor young <i>Antonio</i> is a lamentable Instance of ill
  Conduct in this kind. The young Man did not want natural Talents; but
  the Father of him was a Coxcomb, who affected being a fine Gentleman
  so unmercifully, that he could not endure in his sight, or the
  frequent mention of one, who was his Son, growing into Manhood, and
  thrusting him out of the gay World. I have often thought the Father
  took a secret Pleasure in reflecting that when that fine House and
  Seat came into the next hands, it would revive his Memory, as a Person
  who knew how to enjoy them, from Observation of the Rusticity and
  Ignorance of his Successor. Certain it is that a Man may, if he will,
  let his Heart close to the having no regard to any thing but his dear
  self, even with exclusion of his very Children. I recommend this
  Subject to your Consideration, and am,<br>

A favour well bestow'd, is almost as great an Honour to him who confers
it, as to him who receives it. What indeed makes for the superior
Reputation of the Patron in this case, is, that he is always surrounded
with specious Pretences of unworthy Candidates, and is often alone in
the kind Inclination he has towards the Well-deserving. Justice is the
first Quality in the Man who is in a Post of Direction; and I remember
to have heard an old Gentleman talk of the Civil Wars, and in his
Relation give an Account of a General Officer, who with this one
Quality, without any shining Endowments, became so peculiarly beloved
and honoured, that all Decisions between Man and Man were laid before
him by the Parties concerned in a private Way; and they would lay by
their Animosities implicitly, if he bid them be Friends, or submit
themselves in the Wrong without Reluctance, if he said it, without
waiting the Judgment of Court-Martials. His Manner was to keep the Dates
of all Commissions in his Closet, and wholly dismiss from the Service
such who were deficient in their Duty; and after that, took Care to
prefer according to the Order of Battel. His Familiars were his entire
Friends, and could have no interested Views in courting his
Acquaintance; for his Affection was no Step to their Preferment, tho' it
was to their Reputation. By this means a kind Aspect, a Salutation, a
Smile, and giving out his Hand, had the weight of what is esteem'd by
vulgar Minds more substantial. His Business was very short, and he who
had nothing to do but Justice, was never affronted with a Request of a
familiar daily Visitant for what was due to a brave Man at a Distance.
Extraordinary Merit he used to recommend to the King for some
Distinction at home, till the Order of Battel made way for his rising in
the Troops. Add to this, that he had an excellent Manner of getting rid
of such whom he observed were good at <i>an Halt</i>, as his Phrase was.
Under this Description he comprehended all those who were contented to
live without Reproach, and had no Promptitude in their Minds towards
Glory. These Fellows were also recommended to the King, and taken off of
the General's hands into Posts wherein Diligence and common Honesty were
all that were necessary. This General had no weak Part in his Line; but
every Man had as much Care upon him, and as much Honour to lose as
himself. Every Officer could answer for what pass'd where he was, and
the General's Presence was never necessary any where, but where he had
placed himself at the first Disposition, except that Accident happen'd
from extraordinary Efforts of the Enemy which he could not foresee; but
it was remarkable that it never fell out from Failure in his own Troops.
It must be confess'd, the World is just so much out of order, as an
unworthy Person possesses what should be in the Direction of him who has
better Pretensions to it.<br>
<br>
Instead of such a Conduct as this old Fellow us'd to describe in his
General, all the Evils which have ever happen'd among Mankind have arose
from the wanton Disposition of the Favours of the Powerful. It is
generally all that Men of Modesty and Virtue can do, to fall in with
some whimsical Turn in a Great Man, to make way for things of real and
absolute Service. In the time of Don <i>Sebastian</i> of <i>Portugal</i>, or some
time since, the first Minister would let nothing come near him but what
bore the most profound Face of Wisdom and Gravity. They carry'd it so
far, that, for the greater Shew of their profound Knowledge, a Pair of
Spectacles tied on their Noses, with a black Ribband round their Heads,
was what compleated the Dress of those who made their court at his
Levee, and none with naked Noses were admitted to his Presence. A blunt
honest Fellow, who had a Command in the Train of Artillery, had
attempted to make an Impression upon the Porter day after day in vain,
till at length he made his appearance in a very thoughtful dark sute of
Clothes, and two Pair of Spectacles on at once. He was conducted from
Room to Room with great deference, to the Minister; and carrying on the
Farce of the Place, he told his Excellence, That he had pretended in
this manner to be wiser than he really was, but with no ill Intention;
but he was honest Such-a-one of the Train, and he came to tell him that
they wanted Wheel-barrows and Pick-axes. The thing happened not to
displease, the Great Man was seen to smile, and the successful Officer
was reconducted with the same profound Ceremony out of the House.<br>
<br>
<a name="fr4971">When</a><i> Leo X.</i> reigned Pope of <i>Rome</i>, his Holiness, tho' a Man of Sense,
and of an excellent Taste of Letters, of all things affected Fools,
Buffoons, Humourists, and Coxcombs: Whether it were from Vanity, and
that he enjoy'd no Talents in other Men but what were inferiour to him,
or whatever it was, he carried it so far, that his whole Delight was in
finding out new Fools, and, as our Phrase is, playing them off, and
making them shew themselves to advantage. A Priest of his former
Acquaintance suffered a great many Disappointments in attempting to find
access to him in a regular Character, till at last in despair he retired
from <i>Rome</i>, and returned in an Equipage so very fantastical, both as to
the Dress of himself and Servants, that the whole Court were in an
Emulation who should first introduce him to his Holiness<a href="#f4971"><sup>1</sup></a>. What added
to the Expectation his Holiness had of the Pleasure he should have in
his Follies, was, that this Fellow, in a Dress the most exquisitely
ridiculous, de<b>Sir</b> ed he might speak to him alone, for he had Matters of
the highest Importance, upon which he wanted a Conference. Nothing could
be denied to a Coxcomb of so great hope; but when they were apart, the
Impostor revealed himself, and spoke as follows:

<blockquote>  Do not be surprized, most holy Father, at seeing, instead of a Coxcomb
  to laugh at, your old Friend who has taken this way of Access to
  admonish you of your own Folly. Can any thing shew your Holiness how
  unworthily you treat Mankind, more than my being put upon this
  Difficulty to speak with you? It is a degree of Folly to delight to
  see it in others, and it is the greatest Insolence imaginable to
  rejoice in the Disgrace of human Nature. It is a criminal Humility in
  a Person of your Holiness's Understanding, to believe you cannot excel
  but in the Conversation of Half-wits, Humorists, Coxcombs, and
  Buffoons. If your Holiness has a mind to be diverted like a rational
  Man, you have a great opportunity for it, in disrobing all the
  Impertinents you have favour'd, of all their Riches and Trappings at
  once, and bestowing them on the Humble, the Virtuous, and the Meek. If
  your Holiness is not concerned for the sake of Virtue and Religion, be
  pleased to reflect, that for the sake of your own Safety it is not
  proper to be so very much in jest. When the Pope is thus merry, the
  People will in time begin to think many things, which they have
  hitherto beheld with great Veneration, are in themselves Objects of
  Scorn and Derision. If they once get a Trick of knowing how to laugh,
  your Holiness's saying this Sentence in one Night-Cap and t'other with
  the other, the change of your Slippers, bringing you your Staff in the
  midst of a Prayer, then stripping you of one Vest and clapping on a
  second during divine Service, will be found out to have nothing in it.
  Consider, <b>Sir</b> , that at this rate a Head will be reckoned never the
  wiser for being Bald; and the ignorant will be apt to say, that going
  bare-foot does not at all help on in the way to Heaven. The red Cap
  and the Coul will fall under the same Contempt; and the Vulgar will
  tell us to our Faces that we shall have no Authority over them, but
  from the Force of our Arguments, and the Sanctity of our Lives.

  <i>To the SPECTATOR-GENERAL of</i> Great Britain.<br>
<br>
  <i>From the farther end of the Widow's Coffee-house in</i> Devereaux Court,
  <i>Monday Evening, twenty eight Minutes and a Half past Six.</i><br>
<br>
  <i>Dear Dumb</i>,<br>
<br>
  'In short, to use no further Preface, if I should tell you that I have
  seen a Hackney-Coachman, when he has come to set down his Fare, which
  has consisted of two or three very fine Ladies, hand them out, and
  salute every one of them with an Air of Familiarity, without giving
  the least Offence, you would perhaps think me guilty of a Gasconade.
  But to clear my self from that Imputation, and to explain this Matter
  to you, I assure you that there are many Illustrious Youths within
  this City, who frequently recreate themselves by driving of a
  Hackney-Coach: But those whom, above all others, I would recommend to
  you, are the young Gentlemen belonging to our Inns of Court. We have,
  I think, about a dozen Coachmen, who have Chambers here in the
  <i>Temple</i>; and as it is reasonable to believe others will follow their
  Example, we may perhaps in time (if it shall be thought convenient) be
  drove to <i>Westminster</i> by our own Fraternity, allowing every fifth
  Person to apply his Meditations in this way, which is but a modest
  Computation, as the Humour is now likely to take. It is to be hop'd
  likewise, that there are in the other Nurseries of the Law to be found
  a proportionable number of these hopeful Plants, springing up to the
  everlasting Renown of their native Country. Of how long standing this
  Humour has been, I know not; the first time I had any particular
  Reason to take notice of it, was about this time twelvemonth, when
  being upon <i>Hampstead-Heath</i> with some of these studious young Men,
  who went thither purely for the Sake of Contemplation, nothing would
  serve them but I must go thro' a Course of this Philosophy too; and
  being ever willing to embelish my self with any commendable
  Qualification, it was not long e'er they persuaded me into the
  Coach-box; nor indeed much longer, before I underwent the Fate of my
  Brother <i>Phaeton</i>, for having drove about fifty Paces with pretty good
  Success, through my own natural Sagacity, together with the good
  Instructions of my Tutors, who, to give them their due, were on all
  Hands encouraging and assisting me in this laudable Undertaking; I
  say, <b>Sir</b> , having drove about fifty Paces with pretty good Success, I
  must needs be exercising the Lash, which the Horses resented so ill
  from my Hands, that they gave a sudden Start, and thereby pitched me
  directly upon my Head, as I very well remembered about Half an Hour
  afterwards, which not only deprived me of all the Knowledge I had
  gain'd for fifty Yards before, but had like to have broken my Neck
  into the Bargain. After such a severe Reprimand, you may imagine I was
  not very easily prevail'd with to make a second Attempt; and indeed,
  upon mature Deliberation, the whole Science seem'd, at least to me, to
  be surrounded with so many Difficulties, that notwithstanding the
  unknown Advantages which might have accrued to me thereby, I gave over
  all Hopes of attaining it; and I believe had never thought of it more,
  but that my Memory has been lately refreshed by seeing some of these
  ingenious Gentlemen ply in the open Streets, one of which I saw
  receive so suitable a Reward of his Labours, that tho' I know you are
  no Friend to Story-telling, yet I must beg leave to trouble you with
  this at large.<br>
<br>
  'About a fortnight since, as I was diverting my self with a pennyworth
  of Walnuts at the <i>Temple</i>-Gate, a lively young Fellow in a Fustian
  Jacket shot by me, beckon'd a Coach, and told the Coachman he wanted
  to go as far as <i>Chelsey</i>: They agreed upon the Price, and this young
  Gentleman mounts the Coach-box; the Fellow staring at him, de<b>Sir</b> 'd to
  know if he should not drive till they were out of Town? No, no,
  replied he: He was then going to climb up to him, but received another
  Check, and was then ordered to get into the Coach, or behind it, for
  that he wanted no Instructors; but be sure you Dog you, says he, don't
  you bilk me. The Fellow thereupon surrender'd his Whip, scratch'd his
  Head, and crept into the Coach. Having my self occasion to go into the
  <i>Strand</i> about the same Time, we started both together; but the Street
  being very full of Coaches, and he not so able a Coachman as perhaps
  he imagined himself, I had soon got a little Way before him; often,
  however, having the curiosity to cast my Eye back upon him, to observe
  how he behaved himself in this high Station; which he did with great
  Composure till he came to the Pass, which is a Military Term the
  Brothers of the Whip have given the Strait at St. <i>Clement's</i> Church:
  when he was arrived near this Place, where are always Coaches in
  waiting, the Coachmen began to suck up the Muscles of their Cheeks,
  and to tip the Wink upon each other, as if they had some Roguery in
  their Heads, which I was immediately convinced of; for he no sooner
  came within Reach, but the first of them with his Whip took the exact
  Dimension of his Shoulders, which he very ingeniously call'd
  Endorsing; and indeed I must say, that every one of them took due Care
  to endorse him as he came thro' their Hands. He seem'd at first a
  little uneasy under the Operation, and was going in all haste to take
  the Numbers of their Coaches; but at length by the Mediation of the
  worthy Gentleman in the Coach, his Wrath was asswaged, and he
  prevail'd upon to pursue his Journey; tho' indeed I thought they had
  clapt such a Spoke in his Wheel, as had disabled him from being a
  Coachman for that Day at least: For I am only mistaken, Mr. <b>Spec</b>. if
  some of these Endorsements were not wrote in so strong a Hand, that
  they are still legible. Upon my enquiring the Reason of this unusual
  Salutation, they told me, that it was a Custom among them, whenever
  they saw a Brother tottering or unstable in his Post, to lend him a
  hand in order to settle him again therein: For my part I thought their
  Allegations but reasonable, and so march'd off. Besides our Coachmen,
  we abound in divers other Sorts of ingenious robust Youth, who, I
  hope, will not take it ill if I refer giving you an account of their
  several Recreations to another Opportunity. In the mean time, if you
  would but bestow a little of your wholesome Advice upon our Coachmen,
  it might perhaps be a Reprieve to some of their Necks. As I understand
  you have several Inspectors under you, if you would but send one
  amongst us here in the <i>Temple</i>, I am persuaded he would not want
  Employment. But I leave this to your own Consideration, and am, <br>
<br>
  '<i><b>Sir</b> , Your very humble Servant</i>,<br>
<br>
  'Moses Greenbag.<br>
<br>
  '<i>P. S.</i> I have heard our Criticks in the Coffee-houses hereabout talk
  mightily of the Unity of Time and Place: According to my Notion of the
  Matter, I have endeavoured at something like it in the Beginning of my
  Epistle. I de<b>Sir</b> e to be inform'd a little as to that Particular. In my
  next I design to give you some account of excellent Watermen, who are
  bred to the Law, and far outdo the Land-Students above-mentioned.'</blockquote>

My Friend <b>Will. Honeycomb</b> has told me, for above this half Year, that he
had a great mind to try his Hand at a <i>Spectator</i>, and that he would
fain have one of his writing in my Works. This Morning I received from
him the following Letter, which, after having rectified some little
Orthographical Mistakes, I shall make a Present of to the Publick.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <i>Dear</i> SPEC.<br>
<br>
  'I was, about two Nights ago, in Company with very agreeable young
  People of both Sexes, where talking of some of your Papers which are
  written on Conjugal Love, there arose a Dispute among us, whether
  there were not more bad Husbands in the World than bad Wives. A
  Gentleman, who was Advocate for the Ladies, took this occasion to tell
  us the story of a famous Siege in <i>Germany</i>, which I have since found
  related in my Historical Dictionary, after the following manner. When
  the Emperor <i>Conrade</i> the Third had besieged <i>Guelphus</i>, Duke of
  <i>Bavaria</i>, in the City of <i>Hensberg</i>, the Women finding that the Town
  could not possibly hold out long, petitioned the Emperor that they
  might depart out of it, with so much as each of them could carry. The
  Emperor knowing they could not convey away many of their Effects,
  granted them their Petition; When the Women, to his great Surprize,
  came out of the Place with every one her Husband upon her back. The
  Emperor was so moved at the sight, that he burst into Tears, and after
  having very much extolled the Women for their conjugal Affection, gave
  the Men to their Wives, and received the Duke into his Favour.<br>
<br>
  'The Ladies did not a little triumph at this Story, asking us at the
  same time, whether in our Consciences we believed that the Men of any
  Town in <i>Great Britain</i> would, upon the same Offer, and at the same
  Conjuncture, have loaden themselves with their Wives; or rather,
  whether they would not have been glad of such an opportunity to get
  rid of them? To this my very good Friend <i>Tom Dapperwit</i>, who took
  upon him to be the Mouth of our Sex, replied, that they would be very
  much to blame if they would not do the same good Office for the Women,
  considering that their Strength would be greater, and their Burdens
  lighter. As we were amusing our selves with Discourses of this nature,
  in order to pass away the Evening, which now begins to grow tedious,
  we fell into that laudable and primitive Diversion of Questions and
  Commands. I was no sooner vested with the regal Authority, but I
  enjoined all the Ladies, under pain of my Displeasure, to tell the
  Company ingenuously, in case they had been in the Siege
  abovementioned, and had the same Offers made them as the good Women of
  that Place, what every one of them would have brought off with her,
  and have thought most worth the saving? There were several merry
  Answers made to my Question, which entertained us till Bed-time. This
  filled my Mind with such a huddle of Ideas, that upon my going to
  sleep, I fell into the following Dream.<br>
<br>
  'I saw a Town of this Island, which shall be nameless, invested on
  every side, and the Inhabitants of it so straitned as to cry for
  Quarter. The General refused any other Terms than those granted to the
  abovementioned Town of <i>Hensberg</i>, namely, that the married Women
  might come out with what they could bring along with them. Immediately
  the City-Gates flew open, and a Female Procession appeared. Multitudes
  of the Sex following one another in a row, and staggering under their
  respective Burdens. I took my Stand upon an Eminence in the Enemies
  Camp, which was appointed for the general Rendezvous of these Female
  Carriers, being very de<b>Sir</b> ous to look into their several Ladings. The
  first of them had a huge Sack upon her Shoulders, which she set down
  with great Care: Upon the opening of it, when I expected to have seen
  her Husband shot out of it, I found it was filled with China-Ware. The
  next appeared in a more decent Figure, carrying a handsome young
  Fellow upon her Back: I could not forbear commending the young Woman
  for her Conjugal Affection, when to my great Surprize, I found that
  she had left the good Man at home, and brought away her Gallant. I saw
  the third, at some distance, with a little withered Face peeping over
  her Shoulder, whom I could not suspect for any but her Spouse, till
  upon her setting him down I heard her call him dear Pugg, and found
  him to be her Favourite Monkey. A fourth brought a huge Bale of Cards
  along with her; and the fifth a <i>Bolonia</i> Lap-Dog; for her Husband, it
  seems, being a very Burly Man, she thought it would be less trouble
  for her to bring away little <i>Cupid</i>. The next was the Wife of a rich
  Usurer, loaden with a Bag of Gold; she told us that her Spouse was
  very old, and by the course of Nature could not expect to live long;
  and that to shew her tender regards for him, she had saved that which
  the poor Man loved better than his Life. The next came towards us with
  her Son upon her Back, who, we were told, was the greatest Rake in the
  Place, but so much the Mother's Darling, that she left her Husband
  behind with a large Family of hopeful Sons and Daughters, for the sake
  of this Graceless Youth.<br>
<br>
  'It would be endless to mention the several Persons, with their
  several Loads that appeared to me in this strange Vision. All the
  Place about me was covered with packs of Ribbands, Brocades,
  Embroidery, and Ten thousand other Materials, sufficient to have
  furnished a whole Street of Toy-shops. One of the Women, having an
  Husband who was none of the heaviest, was bringing him off upon her
  Shoulders, at the same time that she carried a great bundle of
  <i>Flanders-lace</i> under her Arm; but finding herself so overloaden, that
  she could not save both of them, she dropp'd the good Man, and brought
  away the Bundle. In short, I found but one Husband among this great
  Mountain of Baggage, who was a lively Cobler, that kick'd and spurr'd
  all the while his Wife was carrying him on, and, as it was said, had
  scarce passed a Day in his Life without giving her the Discipline of
  the Strap.<br>
<br>
  'I cannot conclude my Letter, Dear <b>Spec</b>., without telling thee one
  very odd Whim in this my Dream, I saw, methoughts, a dozen Women
  employed in bringing off one Man; I could not guess who it should be,
  till upon his nearer approach I discover'd thy short Phiz. The Women
  all declared that it was for the sake of thy Works, and not thy
  Person, that they brought thee off, and that it was on condition that
  thou should'st continue the <i>Spectator</i>. If thou thinkest this Dream
  will make a tolerable one, it is at thy Service, from,<br>
<br>
  '<i>Dear</i> <b>Spec</b>.<br>
<br>
  '<i>Thine, Sleeping and Waking</i>,<br>
<br>
  '<b>Will. Honeycomb</b>.'</blockquote><br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
The Ladies will see, by this Letter, what I have often told them, that
<b>Will</b>. is one of those old-fashioned Men of Wit and Pleasure of the Town,
that shews his Parts by Raillery on Marriage, and one who has often
tried his Fortune that way without Success. I <a name="fr4991">cannot</a> however dismiss his
Letter, without observing, that the true Story on which it is built does
Honour to the Sex, and that in order to abuse them, the Writer is
obliged to have recourse to Dream and Fiction<a href="#f4991"><sup>1</sup></a>.<br>

<br>
  <i><b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  'You who are so well acquainted with the Story of <i>Socrates</i>, must
  have read how, upon his making a Discourse concerning Love, he pressed
  his Point with so much Success, that all the Batchelors in his
  Audience took a Resolution to Marry by the first Opportunity, and that
  all the married Men immediately took Horse and galloped home to their
  Wives. I am apt to think your Discourses, in which you have drawn so
  many agreeable Pictures of Marriage, have had a very good Effect this
  way in <i>England</i>. We are obliged to you, at least for having taken off
  that Senseless Ridicule, which for many Years the Witlings of the Town
  have turned upon their Fathers and Mothers. For my own part, I was
  born in Wedlock, and I don't care who knows it; For which Reason,
  among many others, I should look upon my self as a most insufferable
  Coxcomb, did I endeavour to maintain that Cuckoldom was inseparable
  from Marriage, or to make use of <i>Husband</i> and <i>Wife</i> as Terms of
  Reproach. Nay, <b>Sir</b> , I will go one step further, and declare to you
  before the whole World, that I am a married Man, and at the same time
  I have so much Assurance as not to be ashamed of what I have done.<br>
<br>
  'Among the several Pleasures that accompany this state of Life, and
  which you have described in your former Papers, there are two you have
  not taken Notice of, and which are seldom cast into the Account, by
  those who write on this Subject. You must have observed, in your
  Speculations on Human Nature, that nothing is more gratifying to the
  Mind of Man than Power or Dominion; and this I think my self amply
  possessed of, as I am the Father of a Family. I am perpetually taken
  up in giving out Orders, in prescribing Duties, in hearing Parties, in
  administring Justice, and in distributing Rewards and Punishments. To
  speak in the Language of the Centurion, <i>I say unto one, Go, and he
  goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my Servant, Do
  This, and he doth it</i>. In short, <b>Sir</b> , I look upon my Family as a
  Patriarchal Sovereignty, in which I am my self both King and Priest.
  All great Governments are nothing else but Clusters of these little
  private Royalties, and therefore I consider the Masters of Families as
  small Deputy-Governors presiding over the several little Parcels and
  Divisions of their Fellow Subjects. <a name="fr5001">As</a> I take great pleasure in the
  Administration of my Government in particular, so I look upon my self
  not only as a more useful, but as a much greater and happier Man than
  any Batchelor in <i>England</i> of <span style="color: #663300;">my</span><a href="#f5001"><sup>1</sup></a> Rank and Condition.<br>
<br>
  'There is another accidental Advantage in Marriage, which has likewise
  fallen to my share, I mean the having a Multitude of Children. These I
  cannot but regard as very great Blessings. When I see my little Troop
  before me, I rejoice in the Additions which I have made to my Species,
  to my Country, and to my Religion, in having produced such a Number of
  reasonable Creatures, Citizens, and Christians. I am pleased to see my
  self thus perpetuated; and as there is no Production comparable to
  that of a human Creature, I am more proud of having been the Occasion
  of ten such glorious Productions, than if I had built a hundred
  Pyramids at my own Expence, or published as many Volumes of the finest
  Wit and Learning. In what a beautiful Light has the Holy Scripture
  represented <i>Abdon</i>, one of the Judges of <i>Israel</i>, who had forty Sons
  and thirty Grandsons, that rode on Threescore and Ten Ass-Colts,
  according to the Magnificence of the Eastern Countries? How must the
  Heart of the old Man rejoice, when he saw such a beautiful Procession
  of his own Descendants, such a numerous Cavalcade of his own raising?
  For my own part, I can sit in my Parlour with great content, when I
  take a review of half a dozen of my little Boys mounting upon
  Hobby-Horses, and of as many little Girls tutoring their Babies, each
  of them endeavouring to excel the rest, and to do something that may
  gain my Favour and Approbation. I cannot question but he who has
  blessed me with so many Children, will assist my Endeavours in
  providing for them. There is one thing I am able to give each of them,
  which is a virtuous Education. I think it is <b>Sir</b>  <i>Francis Bacon's</i>
  Observation, that in a numerous Family of Children the eldest is often
  spoiled by the Prospect of an Estate, and the youngest by being the
  Darling of the Parent; but that some one or other in the middle, who
  has not perhaps been regarded, has made his way in the World, and
  over-topped the rest. It is my Business to implant in every one of my
  Children the same Seeds of Industry, and the same honest Principles.
  By this Means I think I have a fair Chance, that one or other of them
  may grow considerable in some or other way of Life, whether it be in
  the Army, or in the Fleet, in Trade, or any of the three learned
  Professions; for you must know, <b>Sir</b> , that from long Experience and
  Observation, I am persuaded of what seems a Paradox to most of those
  with whom I converse, namely, That a Man who has many Children, and
  gives them a good Education, is more likely to raise a Family, than he
  who has but one, notwithstanding he leaves him his whole Estate. For
  this reason I cannot forbear amusing my self with finding out a
  General, an Admiral, or an Alderman of <i>London</i>, a Divine, a
  Physician, or a Lawyer, among my little People who are now perhaps in
  Petticoats; and when I see the Motherly Airs of my little Daughters
  when they are playing with their Puppets, I cannot but flatter my self
  that their Husbands and Children will be happy in the Possession of
  such Wives and Mothers.<br>

As some of the finest Compositions among the Ancients are in Allegory, I
have endeavoured, in several of my Papers, to revive that way of
Writing, and hope I have not been altogether unsuccessful in it; for I
find there is always a great Demand for those particular Papers, and
cannot but observe that several Authors have endeavoured of late to
excel in Works of this Nature. Among these, I do not know any one who
has succeeded better than a very ingenious Gentleman, to whom I am much
obliged for the following Piece, and who was the Author of the Vision in
the <a href="#section460">CCCCLXth Paper</a>.<span style="color: #663300;"> O.</span><br>
<br>
How are we tortured with the Absence of what we covet to possess, when
it appears to be lost to us! What Excursions does the Soul make in
Imagination after it! And how does it turn into it self again, more
foolishly fond and dejected, at the Disappointment? Our Grief, instead
of having recourse to Reason, which might restrain it, searches to find
a further Nourishment. It calls upon Memory to relate the several
Passages and Circumstances of Satisfactions which we formerly enjoyed:
the Pleasures we purchased by those Riches that are taken from us; or
the Power and Splendour of our departed Honours; or the Voice, the
Words, the Looks, the Temper, and Affections of our Friends that are
deceased. It needs must happen from hence that the Passion should often
swell to such a Size as to burst the Heart which contains it, if Time
did not make these Circumstances less strong and lively, so that Reason
should become a more equal Match for the Passion, or if another De<b>Sir</b> e
which becomes more present did not overpower them with a livelier
Representation. These are Thoughts which I had, when I fell into a kind
of Vision upon this Subject, and may therefore stand for a proper
Introduction to a Relation of it.<br>
<br>
I found my self upon a naked Shore, with Company whose afflicted
Countenances witnessed their Conditions. Before us flowed a Water deep,
silent, and called the River of <i>Tears</i>, which issuing from two
Fountains on an upper Ground, encompassed an Island that lay before us.
The Boat which plied in it was old and shattered, having been sometimes
overset by the Impatience and Haste of single Passengers to arrive at
the other side. This immediately was brought to us by <i>Misfortune</i> who
steers it, and we were all preparing to take our places, when there
appeared a Woman of a mild and composed Behaviour, who began to deter us
from it, by representing the Dangers which would attend our Voyage.
Hereupon some who knew her for <i>Patience</i>, and some of those too who
till then cry'd the loudest, were persuaded by her, and returned back.
The rest of us went in, and she (whose Good-nature would not suffer her
to forsake Persons in Trouble) de<b>Sir</b> ed leave to accompany us, that she
might at least administer some small Comfort or Advice while we sailed.
We were no sooner embarked but the Boat was push'd off, the Sheet was
spread; and being filled with <i>Sighs</i>, which are the Winds of that
Country, we made a passage to the farther Bank, through several
Difficulties of which the most of us seemed utterly regardless.<br>
<br>
When we landed, we perceived the Island to be strangely overcast with
Fogs, which no Brightness could pierce, so that a kind of gloomy Horror
sat always brooding over it. This had something in it very shocking to
easy Tempers, insomuch that some others, whom <i>Patience</i> had by this
time gained over, left us here, and privily convey'd themselves round
the Verge of the Island to find a Ford by which she told them they might
escape.<br>
<br>
For my part, I still went along with those who were for piercing into
the Centre of the Place; and joining our selves to others whom we found
upon the same Journey, we marched solemnly as at a Funeral, through
bordering Hedges of Rosemary, and through a Grove of Yew-trees, which
love to overshadow Tombs and flourish in Church-yards. Here we heard on
every side the Wailings and Complaints of several of the Inhabitants,
who had cast themselves disconsolately at the Feet of Trees; and as we
chanced to approach any of these, we might perceive them wringing their
Hands, beating their Breasts, tearing their Hair, or after some other
manner visibly agitated with Vexation. Our Sorrows were heightened by
the Influence of what we heard and saw, and one of our Number was
wrought up to such a Pitch of Wildness, as to talk of hanging himself
upon a Bough which shot temptingly across the Path we travelled in; but
he was restrained from it by the kind Endeavours of our above-mentioned
Companion.<br>
<br>
We had now gotten into the most dusky silent part of the Island, and by
the redoubled Sounds of Sighs, which made a doleful Whistling in the
Branches, the thickness of Air which occasioned faintish Respiration,
and the violent Throbbings of Heart which more and more affected us, we
found that we approached the <i>Grotto of Grief</i>. It was a wide, hollow,
and melancholy Cave, sunk deep in a Dale, and watered by Rivulets that
had a Colour between Red and Black. These crept slow and half congealed
amongst its Windings, and mixed their heavy Murmur with the Echo of
Groans that rolled through all the Passages. In the most retired Part of
it sat the <i>Doleful Being</i> her self; the Path to her was strowed with
Goads, Stings and Thorns; and her Throne on which she sat was broken
into a Rock, with ragged Pieces pointing upwards for her to lean upon. A
heavy Mist hung above her, her Head oppressed with it reclined upon her
Arm: Thus did she reign over her disconsolate Subjects, full of her self
to stupidity, in eternal Pensiveness, and the profoundest Silence. On
one side of her stood <i>Dejection</i> just dropping into a Swoon, and
<i>Paleness</i> wasting to a Skeleton; on the other side were <i>Care</i> inwardly
tormented with Imaginations, and <i>Anguish</i> suffering outward <i>Troubles</i>
to suck the Blood from her Heart in the shape of <i>Vultures</i>. The whole
Vault had a genuine Dismalness in it, which a few scattered Lamps, whose
bluish Flames arose and sunk in their Urns, discovered to our Eyes with
Encrease. Some of us fell down, overcome and spent with what they
suffered in the way, and were given over to those Tormentors that stood
on either hand of the Presence; others, galled and mortified with Pain,
recover'd the Entrance, where <i>Patience</i>, whom we had left behind, was
still waiting to receive us.<br>
<br>
With her (whose Company was now become more grateful to us by the want
we had found of her) we winded round the Grotto, and ascended at the
back of it, out of the mournful Dale in whose Bottom it lay. On this
Eminence we halted, by her Advice, to pant for Breath; and lifting our
Eyes, which till then were fixed downwards, felt a sullen sort of
Satisfaction, in observing through the Shades what Numbers had entred
the Island. The Satisfaction, which appears to have Ill-nature in it,
was excusable, because it happened at a time when we were too much taken
up with our own concern, to have respect to that of others; and
therefore we did not consider them as suffering, but ourselves as not
suffering in the most forlorn Estate. It had also the Ground-work of
Humanity and Compassion in it, tho' the Mind was then too dark and too
deeply engaged to perceive it; but as we proceeded onwards, it began to
discover it self, and from observing that others were unhappy, we came
to question one another, when it was that we met, and what were the sad
Occasions that brought us together. Then we heard our Stories, we
compared them, we mutually gave and received <i>Pity</i>, and so by degrees
became tolerable Company.<br>
<br>
A considerable part of the troublesome Road was thus deceived; at length
the Openings among the Trees grew larger, the Air seemed thinner, it lay
with less oppression upon us, and we could now and then discern tracks
in it of a lighter Greyness, like the Breakings of Day, short in
duration, much enlivening, and called in that Country <i>Gleams of
Amusement</i>. Within a short while these Gleams began to appear more
frequent, and then brighter and of a longer continuance; the <i>Sighs</i>
that hitherto filled the Air with so much Dolefulness, altered to the
Sound of common Breezes, and in general the Horrors of the Island were
abated.<br>
<br>
When we had arrived at last at the Ford by which we were to pass out, we
met with those fashionable Mourners who had been ferried over along with
us, and who being unwilling to go as far as we, had coasted by the Shore
to find the place, where they waited our coming; that by shewing
themselves to the World only at the time when we did, they might seem
also to have been among the Troubles of the Grotto. Here the Waters that
rolled on the other side so deep and silent, were much dried up, and it
was an easier matter for us to wade over.<br>
<br>
The River being crossed, we were received upon the further Bank by our
Friends and Acquaintance, whom <i>Comfort</i> had brought out to congratulate
our Appearance in the World again. Some of these blamed us for staying
so long away from them, others advised us against all Temptations of
going back again; every one was cautious not to renew our Trouble, by
asking any particulars of the Journey; and all concluded, that in a case
of so much Melancholy and Affliction, we could not have made choice of a
fitter Companion than <i>Patience</i>. Here <i>Patience</i>, appearing serene at
her Praises, delivered us over to <i>Comfort</i>. <i>Comfort</i> smiled at his
receiving the Charge; immediately the Sky purpled on that side to which
he turned, and double Day at once broke in upon me.<br>

<br>

When Men read, they taste the Matter with which they are entertained,
according as their own respective Studies and Inclinations have prepared
them, and make their Reflections accordingly. Some perusing <i>Roman</i>
Writers, would find in them, whatever the Subject of the Discourses
were, parts which implied the Grandeur of that People in their Warfare
or their Politicks. As for my part, who am a meer SPECTATOR, I drew this
Morning Conclusions of their Eminence in what I think great, to wit, in
having worthy Sentiments, from the reading a Comedy of <i>Terence</i>. The
Play was the <i>Self-Tormentor</i>. It is from the Beginning to the End a
perfect Picture of human Life, but I did not observe in the whole one
Passage that could raise a Laugh. How well disposed must that People be,
who could be entertained with Satisfaction by so sober and polite Mirth?
In the first Scene of the Comedy, when one of the old Men accuses the
other of Impertinence for interposing in his Affairs, he answers, <i>I am
a Man, and cannot help feeling any Sorrow that can arrive at Man</i>. It is
said, this Sentence was received with an universal Applause. There
cannot be a greater Argument of the general good Understanding of a
People, than a sudden Consent to give their Approbation of a Sentiment
which has no Emotion in it. If it were spoken with never so great Skill
in the Actor, the Manner of uttering that Sentence could have nothing in
it which could strike any but People of the greatest Humanity, nay
People elegant and skilful in Observations upon it. It is possible he
might have laid his Hand on his Breast, and with a winning Insinuation
in his Countenance, expressed to his Neighbour that he was a Man who
made his case his own; yet I'll engage a Player in <i>Covent-Garden</i> might
hit such an Attitude a thousand times before he would have been
regarded. I have <a name="fr5021">heard</a> that a Minister of State in the Reign of Queen
<i>Elizabeth</i> had all manner of Books and Ballads brought to him, of what
kind soever, and took great Notice how much they took with the People;
upon which he would, and certainly might, very well judge of their
present Dispositions, and the most proper way of applying them according
to his own purposes<a href="#f5021"><sup>1</sup></a>. What passes on the Stage, and the Reception it
meets with from the Audience, is a very useful Instruction of this Kind.
According to what you may observe there on our Stage, you see them often
moved so directly against all common Sense and Humanity, that you would
be apt to pronounce us a Nation of Savages. It cannot be called a
Mistake of what is pleasant, but the very contrary to it is what most
assuredly takes with them. The other Night an old Woman carried off with
a Pain in her Side, with all the Distortions and Anguish of Countenance
which is natural to one in that Condition, was laughed and clapped off
the Stage. <i>Terence's</i> Comedy, which I am speaking of, is indeed written
as if he hoped to please none but such as had as good a Taste as
himself. I <a name="fr5022">could</a> not but reflect upon the natural Description of the
innocent young Woman made by the Servant to his Master. 

<blockquote><i>When I came to
the House</i>, said he, <i>an old Woman opened the Door, and I followed her
in, because I could by entring upon them unawares better observe what
was your Mistress's ordinary manner of spending her Time, the only way
of judging any one's Inclinations and Genius. I found her at her Needle
in a sort of second Mourning, which she wore for an Aunt she had lately
lost. She had nothing on but what shewed she dressed only for herself.
Her Hair hung negligently about her Shoulders. She had none of the Arts
with which others use to set themselves off, but had that Negligence of
Person which is remarkable in those who are careful of their Minds&mdash;Then
she had a Maid who was at work near her, that was a Slattern, because
her Mistress was careless; which I take to be another Argument of your
security in her; for the</i> Go-betweens <i>of Women of Intrigue are rewarded
too well to be dirty. When you were named, I told her you de<b>Sir</b> ed to see
her, she threw down her Work for Joy, covered her Face, and decently hid
her Tears</i><a href="#f5022"><sup>2</sup></a></blockquote>

He must be a very good Actor, and draw Attention rather
from his own Character than the Words of the Author, that could gain it
among us for this Speech, though so full of Nature and good Sense.<br>
<br>
The intolerable Folly and Confidence of Players putting in Words of
their own, does in a great measure feed the absurd Taste of the
Audience. But however that is, it is ordinary for a Cluster of Coxcombs
to take up the House to themselves, and equally insult both the Actors
and the Company. These Savages, who want all manner of Regard and
Deference to the rest of Mankind, come only to shew themselves to us,
without any other Purpose than to let us know they despise us.<br>
<br>
The gross of an Audience is composed of two sorts of People, those who
know no Pleasure but of the Body, and those who improve or command
corporeal Pleasures by the addition of fine Sentiments of the Mind. At
present the intelligent part of the Company are wholly subdued, by the
Insurrections of those who know no Satisfactions but what they have in
common with all other Animals.<br>
<br>
This is the reason that when a Scene tending to Procreation is acted,
you see the whole Pit in such a Chuckle, and old Letchers, with Mouths
open, stare at the loose Gesticulations on the Stage with shameful
Earnestness; when the justest Pictures of human Life in its calm
Dignity, and the properest Sentiments for the Conduct of it, pass by
like meer Narration, as conducing only to somewhat much better which is
to come after. I have seen the whole House at some times in so proper a
Disposition, that indeed I have trembled for the Boxes, and feared the
Entertainment would end in the Representation of the Rape of the
<i>Sabines</i>.<br>
<br>
I would not be understood in this Talk to argue, that nothing is
tolerable on the Stage but what has an immediate Tendency to the
Promotion of Virtue. On the contrary, I can allow, provided there is
nothing against the Interests of Virtue, and is not offensive to
Good-manners, that things of an indifferent nature may be represented.
For <a name="fr5023">this</a> Reason I have no Exception to the well-drawn Rusticities in the
<i>Country-Wake</i><a href="#f5023"><sup>3</sup></a>; and there is something so miraculously pleasant in
<i>Dogget's</i> acting the aukward Triumph and comick Sorrow of <i>Hob</i> in
different Circumstances, that I shall not be able to stay away whenever
it is acted. All that vexes me is, that the Gallantry of taking the
Cudgels for <i>Gloucestershire</i>, with the Pride of Heart in tucking
himself up, and taking Aim at his Adversary, as well as the other's
Protestation in the Humanity of low Romance, That he could not promise
the Squire to break <i>Hob's</i> Head, but he would, if he could, do it in
Love; then flourish and begin: I say, what vexes me is, that such
excellent Touches as these, as well as the Squire's being out of all
patience at <i>Hob's</i> Success, and venturing himself into the Croud, are
Circumstances hardly taken Notice of, and the height of the Jest is only
in the very Point that Heads are broken. I am confident, were there a
Scene written, wherein <i>Penkethman</i> should break his Leg by wrestling
with <i>Bullock</i>, and <i>Dicky</i> come in to set it, without one word said but
what should be according to the exact Rules of Surgery in making this
Extention, and binding up the Leg, the whole House should be in a Roar
of Applause at the dissembled Anguish of the Patient, the help given by
him who threw him down, and the handy Address and arch Looks of the
Surgeon. To enumerate the entrance of Ghosts, the Embattling of Armies,
the Noise of Heroes in Love, with a thousand other Enormities, would be
to transgress the bounds of this Paper, for which reason it is possible
they may have hereafter distinct Discourses; not forgetting any of the
Audience who shall set up for Actors, and interrupt the Play on the
Stage; and Players who shall prefer the Applause of Fools to that of the
reasonable part of the Company.<br>

  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'You have often mention'd with great Vehemence and Indignation the
  Misbehaviour of People at Church; but I am at present to talk to you
  on that Subject, and complain to you of one, whom at the same time I
  know not what to accuse of, except it be looking too well there, and
  diverting the Eyes of the Congregation to that one Object. However I
  have this to say, that she might have stay'd at her own Parish, and
  not come to perplex those who are otherwise intent upon their Duty.<br>
<br>
   'Last <i>Sunday</i> was Seven-night I went into a Church not far from
  <i>London</i>-Bridge; but I wish I had been contented to go to my own
  Parish, I am sure it had been better for me: I say, I went to Church
  thither, and got into a Pew very near the Pulpit. I had hardly been
  accommodated with a Seat, before there entered into the Isle a young
  Lady in the very Bloom of Youth and Beauty, and dressed in the most
  elegant manner imaginable. Her Form was such, that it engaged the Eyes
  of the whole Congregation in an Instant, and mine among the rest. Tho'
  we were all thus fixed upon her, she was not in the least out of
  Countenance, or under the least Disorder, tho' unattended by any one,
  and not seeming to know particularly where to place her self. However,
  she had not in the least a confident Aspect, but moved on with the
  most graceful Modesty, every one making Way till she came to a Seat
  just over-against that in which I was placed. The Deputy of the Ward
  sat in that Pew, and she stood opposite to him; and at a Glance into
  the Seat, tho' she did not appear the least acquainted with the
  Gentleman, was let in, with a Confusion that spoke much Admiration at
  the Novelty of the Thing. The Service immediately began, and she
  compos'd her self for it with an Air of so much Goodness and
  Sweetness, that the Confession which she uttered so as to be heard
  where I sat, appeared an Act of Humiliation more than she had Occasion
  for. The Truth is, her Beauty had something so innocent, and yet so
  sublime, that we all gazed upon her like a Phantom. None of the
  Pictures which we behold of the best <i>Italian</i> Painters, have any
  thing like the Spirit which appeared in her Countenance, at the
  different Sentiments expressed in the several Parts of Divine Service:
  That Gratitude and Joy at a Thanksgiving, that Lowliness and Sorrow at
  the Prayers for the Sick and Distressed, that Triumph at the Passages
  which gave Instances of divine Mercy, which appeared respectively in
  her Aspect, will be in my Memory to my last Hour. I protest to you,
  <b>Sir</b> , she suspended the Devotion of every one around her; and the Ease
  she did every thing with, soon dispersed the churlish Dislike and
  Hesitation in approving what is excellent, too frequent amongst us, to
  a general Attention and Entertainment in observing her Behaviour. All
  the while that we were gazing at her, she took Notice of no Object
  about her, but had an Art of seeming awkwardly attentive, whatever
  else her Eyes were accidentally thrown upon. One Thing indeed was
  particular, she stood the whole Service, and never kneeled or sat; I
  do not question but that was to shew her self with the greater
  Advantage, and set forth to better Grace her Hands and Arms, lifted up
  with the most ardent Devotion, and her Bosom, the fairest Observation;
  while she, you must think, knew nothing of the Concern she gave
  others, any other than as an Example of Devotion, that threw her self
  out, without regard to Dress or Garment, all Contrition, and loose of
  all Worldly Regards, in Ecstasy of Devotion. Well, now the Organ was
  to play a Voluntary, and she was so skilful in Musick, and so touched
  with it, that she kept time not only with some Motion of her Head, but
  also with a different Air in her Countenance. When the Musick was
  strong and bold, she look'd exalted, but serious; when lively and
  airy, she was smiling and gracious; when the Notes were more soft and
  languishing, she was kind and full of Pity. When she had now made it
  visible to the whole Congregation, by her Motion and Ear, that she
  could dance, and she wanted now only to inform us that she could sing
  too, when the Psalm was given out, her Voice was distinguished above
  all the rest, or rather People did not exert their own in order to
  hear her. Never was any heard so sweet and so strong. The Organist
  observed it, and he thought fit to play to her only, and she swelled
  every Note; when she found she had thrown us all out, and had the last
  Verse to herself in such a manner as the whole Congregation was intent
  upon her, in the same manner as we see in the Cathedrals, they are on
  the Person who sings alone the Anthem. Well, it came at last to the
  Sermon, and our young Lady would not lose her Part in that neither;
  for she fixed her Eye upon the Preacher, and as he said any thing she
  approved, with one of <i>Charles Mathers's</i> fine Tablets she set down
  the Sentence, at once shewing her fine Hand, the Gold-Pen, her
  Readiness in Writing, and her Judgment in chusing what to write. To
  sum up what I intend by this long and particular Account, I mean to
  appeal to you, whether it is reasonable that such a Creature as this
  shall come from a jaunty Part of the Town, and give herself such
  violent Airs, to the disturbance of an innocent and inoffensive
  Congregation, with her Sublimities. The Fact, I assure you, was as I
  have related; but I had like to have forgot another very considerable
  Particular. As soon as Church was done, she immediately stepp'd out of
  her Pew, and fell into the finest pitty-pat Air, forsooth, wonderfully
  out of Countenance, tossing her Head up and down as she swam along the
  Body of the Church. I, with several others of the Inhabitants,
  follow'd her out, and saw her hold up her Fan to an Hackney-Coach at a
  Distance, who immediately came up to her, and she whipp'd into it with
  great Nimbleness, pull'd the Door with a bowing Mein, as if she had
  been used to a better Glass. She said aloud, <i>You know where to go</i>,
  and drove off. By this time the best of the Congregation was at the
  Church-Door, and I could hear some say, <i>A very fine Lady</i>; others,
  <i>I'll warrant ye, she's no better than she should be</i>; and one very
  wise old Lady said, <i>She ought to have been taken up</i>. Mr. SPECTATOR,
  I think this Matter lies wholly before you: for the Offence does not
  come under any Law, tho' it is apparent this Creature came among us

  I de<b>Sir</b> e you would print this, that she may be confin'd to her own
  Parish; for I can assure you there is no attending any thing else in a
  Place where she is a Novelty. She has been talked of among us ever
  since under the Name of the <i>Phantom</i>: But I would advise her to come
  no more; for there is so strong a Party made by the Women against her,
  that she must expect they will not be excell'd a second time in so
  outrageous a manner, without doing her some Insult. Young Women, who
  assume after this rate, and affect exposing themselves to view in
  Congregations at t'other end of the Town, are not so mischievous,
  because they are rivall'd by more of the same Ambition, who will not
  let the rest of the Company be particular: But in the Name of the
  whole Congregation where I was, I de<b>Sir</b> e you to keep these agreeable
  Disturbances out of the City, where Sobriety of Manners is still
  preserv'd, and all glaring and ostentatious Behaviour, even in things
  laudable, discountenanced. I wish you may never see the Phantom, and
  am,'<br>

It is a great Convenience to those who want Wit to furnish out a
Conversation, that there is something or other in all Companies where it
is wanted substituted in its stead, which according to their Taste, does
the Business as well. Of this nature is the agreeable Pastime in
Country-Halls of Cross-purposes, Questions and Commands, and the like. A
little superior to these are those who can play at Crambo, or cap
Verses. Then above them are such as can make Verses, that is, Rhime; and
among those who have the <i>Latin</i> Tongue, such as use to make what they
call golden Verses. Commend me also to those who have not Brains enough
for any of these Exercises, and yet do not give up their Pretensions to
Mirth. These can slap you on the Back unawares, laugh loud, ask you how
you do with a Twang on your Shoulders, say you are dull to-day, and
laugh a Voluntary to put you in Humour; the laborious Way among the
minor Poets, of making things come into such and such a Shape, as that
of an Egg, an Hand, an Ax, or any thing that no body had ever thought on
before for that purpose, or which would have cost a great deal of Pains
to accomplish it if they did. But all these Methods, tho' they are
mechanical, and may be arrived at with the smallest Capacity, do not
serve an honest Gentleman who wants Wit for his Ordinary Occasions;
therefore it is absolutely necessary that the Poor in Imagination should
have something which may be serviceable to them at all Hours upon all
common Occurrences. That which we call Punning is therefore greatly
affected by Men of small Intellects. These Men need not be concerned
with you for the whole Sentence; but if they can say a quaint thing, or
bring in a Word which sounds like any one Word you have spoken to them
they can turn the Discourse, or distract you so that you cannot go on,
and by consequence if they cannot be as witty as you are, they can
hinder your being any wittier than they are. Thus if you talk of a
Candle, he <i>can deal</i> with you; and if you ask him to help you to some
Bread, a Punster should think himself very ill-<i>bred</i> if he did not; and
if he is not as well-<i>bred</i> as your self, he hopes for <i>Grains</i> of
Allowance. If you do not understand that last Fancy, you must recollect
that Bread is made of Grain; and so they go on for ever, without
Possibility of being exhausted.<br>
<br>
There are another Kind of People of small Faculties, who supply want of
Wit with want of Breeding; and because Women are both by Nature and
Education more offended at any thing which is immodest than we Men are,
these are ever harping upon things they ought not to allude to, and deal
mightily in double Meanings. Every one's own Observation will suggest
Instances enough of this kind, without my mentioning any; for your
double Meaners are dispersed up and down thro' all Parts of Town or City
where there are any to offend, in order to set off themselves. These Men
are mighty loud Laughers, and held very pretty Gentlemen with the
sillier and unbred Part of Womankind. But above all already mentioned,
or any who ever were, or ever can be in the World, the happiest and
surest to be pleasant, are a Sort of People whom we have not indeed
lately heard much of, and those are your <i>Biters</i>.<br>
<br>
<a name="fr5041"></a>A <i>Biter</i><a href="#f5041"><sup>1</sup></a> is one who tells you a thing you have no reason to
disbelieve in it self; and perhaps has given you, before he bit you, no
reason to disbelieve it for his saying it; and if you give him Credit,
laughs in your Face, and triumphs that he has deceiv'd you. In a Word, a
<i>Biter</i> is one who thinks you a Fool, because you do not think him a
Knave. This Description of him one may insist upon to be a just one; for
what else but a Degree of Knavery is it, to depend upon Deceit for what
you gain of another, be it in point of Wit, or Interest, or any thing
else?<br>
<br>
This way of Wit is called <i>Biting</i>, by a Metaphor taken from Beasts of
Prey, which devour harmless and unarmed Animals, and look upon them as
their Food wherever they meet them. The Sharpers about Town very
ingeniously understood themselves to be to the undesigning Part of
Mankind what Foxes are to Lambs, and therefore used the Word <i>Biting</i> to
express any Exploit wherein they had over-reach'd any innocent and
inadvertent Man of his Purse. These Rascals of late Years have been the
Gallants of the Town, and carried it with a fashionable haughty Air, to
the discouragement of Modesty and all honest Arts. Shallow Fops, who are
govern'd by the Eye, and admire every thing that struts in vogue, took
up from the Sharpers the Phrase of <i>Biting</i>, and used it upon all
Occasions, either to disown any nonsensical Stuff they should talk
themselves, or evade the Force of what was reasonably said by others.
Thus, when one of these cunning Creatures was enter'd into a Debate with
you, whether it was practicable in the present State of Affairs to
accomplish such a Proposition, and you thought he had let fall what
destroy'd his Side of the Question, as soon as you look'd with an
Earnestness ready to lay hold of it, he immediately cry'd, <i>Bite</i>, and
you were immediately to acknowledge all that Part was in Jest. They
carry this to all the Extravagance imaginable, and if one of these
Witlings knows any Particulars which may give Authority to what he says,
he is still the more ingenious if he imposes upon your Credulity. I
remember a remarkable Instance of this Kind. There came up a shrewd
young Fellow to a plain young Man, his Countryman, and taking him aside
with a grave concern'd Countenance, goes on at this rate: I see you
here, and have you heard nothing out of <i>Yorkshire</i>&mdash;You look so
surpriz'd you could not have heard of it&mdash;and yet the Particulars are
such, that it cannot be false: I am sorry I am got into it so far that I
now must tell you; but I know not but it may be for your Service to
know&mdash;on <i>Tuesday</i> last, just after Dinner&mdash;you know his Manner is to
smoke, opening his Box, your Father fell down dead in an Apoplexy. The
Youth shew'd the filial Sorrow which he ought&mdash;Upon which the witty Man
cry'd, <i>Bite, there was nothing in all this</i>&mdash;<br>
<br>
To put an end to this silly, pernicious, frivolous Way at once, I will
give the Reader one late Instance of a <i>Bite</i>, which no <i>Biter</i> for the
future will ever be able to equal, tho' I heartily wish him the same
Occasion. It is a Superstition with some Surgeons who beg the Bodies of
condemn'd Malefactors, to go to the Gaol, and bargain for the Carcase
with the Criminal himself. A good honest Fellow did so last Sessions,
and was admitted to the condemned Men on the Morning wherein they died.
The Surgeon communicated his Business, and fell into discourse with a
little Fellow, who refused Twelve Shillings, and insisted upon Fifteen
for his Body. The Fellow, who kill'd the Officer of <i>Newgate</i>, very
forwardly, and like a Man who was willing to deal, told him, Look you,
Mr. Surgeon, that little dry Fellow, who has been half-starved all his
Life, and is now half-dead with Fear, cannot answer your Purpose. I have
ever liv'd high and freely, my Veins are full, I have not pined in
Imprisonment; you see my Crest swells to your Knife, and after
<i>Jack-Catch</i> has done, upon my Honour you'll find me as sound as e'er a
Bullock in any of the Markets. Come, for Twenty Shillings I am your
Man&mdash;Says the Surgeon, Done, there's a Guinea&mdash;This witty Rogue took the
Money, and as soon as he had it in his Fist, cries, <i>Bite, I am to be
hang'd in Chains.</i><br>

Those who have maintain'd that Men would be more miserable than Beasts,
were their Hopes confin'd to this Life only; among other Considerations
take notice that the latter are only afflicted with the Anguish of the
present Evil, whereas the former are very often pained by the Reflection
on what is passed, and the Fear of what is to come. This Fear of any
Future Difficulties or Misfortunes is so natural to the Mind, that were
a Man's Sorrows and Disquietudes summ'd up at the End of his Life, it
would generally be found that he had suffer'd more from the Apprehension
of such Evils as never happen'd to him, than from those Evils which had
really befallen him. To this we may add, that among those Evils which
befal us, there are many that have been more painful to us in the
Prospect, than by their actual Pressure.<br>
<br>
This natural Impatience to look into Futurity, and to know what
Accidents may happen to us hereafter, has given birth to many ridiculous
Arts and Inventions. Some found their Prescience on the Lines of a Man's
Hand, others on the Features of his Face; some on the Signatures which
Nature has impressed on his Body, and others on his own Hand-Writing:
Some read Men's Fortunes in the Stars, as others have searched after
them in the Entrails of Beasts, or the Flights of Birds. Men of the best
Sense have been touched, more or less, with these groundless Horrours
and Presages of Futurity, upon surveying the most indifferent Works of
Nature. Can any thing be more surprizing than to consider <i>Cicero</i>, who
made the greatest Figure at the Bar, and in the Senate of the <i>Roman</i>
Commonwealth, and, at the same time, outshined all the Philosophers of
Antiquity in his Library and in his Retirements, as busying himself in
the College of Augurs, and observing, with a religious Attention, after
what manner the Chickens peck'd the several Grains of Corn which were
thrown to them?<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding these Follies are pretty well worn out of the Minds of
the Wise and Learned in the present Age, Multitudes of weak and ignorant
Persons are still Slaves to them. There are numberless Arts of
Prediction among the Vulgar, which are too trifling to enumerate; and
infinite Observations, of Days, Numbers, Voices, and Figures, which are
regarded by them as Portents and Prodigies. In short, every thing
Prophesies to the superstitious Man, there is scarce a Straw or a rusty
Piece of Iron that lies in his way by Accident.<br>
<br>
It is not to be conceiv'd how many Wizards, Gypsies, and Cunning-Men are
dispers'd thro' all the Countries and Market-Towns of <i>Great-Britain</i>,
not to mention the Fortune-tellers and Astrologers, who live very
comfortably upon the Curiosity of several well-dispos'd Persons in the
Cities of <i>London</i> and <i>Westminster</i>.<br>
<br>
Among the many pretended Arts of Divination, there is none which so
universally amuses as that by Dreams. I have indeed observ'd in a late
Speculation, that there have been sometimes, upon very extraordinary
Occasions, supernatural Revelations made to certain Persons by this
means; but as it is the chief Business of this Paper to root out popular
Errors, I must endeavour to expose the Folly and Superstition of those
Persons, who, in the common and ordinary course of Life, lay any stress
upon things of so uncertain, shadowy, and chimerical a nature. This I
cannot do more effectually than by the following Letter, which is dated
from a Quarter of the Town that has always been the Habitation of some
prophetick <i>Philomath</i>; it <a name="fr5051">having</a> been usual, time out of Mind, for all
such People as have lost their Wits, to resort to that Place either for
their Cure<a href="#f5051"><sup>1</sup></a> or for their Instruction.<br>

<blockquote>  <i>Moor-Fields</i>, Oct. 4, 1712.<br>
<br>
  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'Having long consider'd whether there be any Trade wanting in this
  great City, after having survey'd very attentively all kinds of Ranks
  and Professions, I do not find in any Quarter of the Town an
  <i>Oneirocritick</i>, or, in plain <i>English</i>, an Interpreter of Dreams. For
  want of so useful a Person, there are several good People who are very
  much puzled in this Particular, and dream a whole Year together
  without being ever the wiser for it. I hope I am pretty well qualify'd
  for this Office, having studied by Candlelight all the Rules of Art
  which have been laid down upon this Subject. My great Uncle by my
  Wife's Side was a <i>Scotch</i> Highlander, and second-sighted. I have four
  Fingers and two Thumbs upon one Hand, and was born on the longest
  Night of the Year. My Christian and <b>Sir</b> -Name begin and end with the
  same Letters. I am lodg'd in <i>Moorfields</i>, in a House that for these
  fifty years has been always tenanted by a Conjurer.<br>
<br>
  'If you had been in Company, so much as my self, with ordinary Women
  of the Town, you must know that there are many of them who every day
  in their Lives, upon seeing or hearing of any thing that is
  unexpected, cry, <i>My Dream is out</i>; and cannot go to sleep in quiet
  the next night, till something or other has happen'd which has
  expounded the Visions of the preceding one. There are others who are
  in very great pain for not being able to recover the Circumstances of
  a Dream, that made strong Impressions upon them while it lasted. In
  short, <b>Sir</b> , there are many whose waking Thoughts are wholly employ'd
  on their sleeping ones. For the benefit therefore of this curious and
  inquisitive Part of my Fellow-Subjects, I shall in the first place
  tell those Persons what they dreamt of, who fancy they never dream at
  all. In the next place, I shall make out any Dream, upon hearing a
  single Circumstance of it; and in the last place, shall expound to
  them the good or bad Fortune which such Dreams portend. If they do not
  presage good luck, I shall de<b>Sir</b> e nothing for my Pains; not
  questioning at the same time that those who consult me will be so
  reasonable as to afford me a moderate Share out of any considerable
  Estate, Profit or Emolument which I shall thus discover to them. I
  interpret to the Poor for nothing, on condition that their Names may
  be inserted in Publick Advertisements, to attest the Truth of such my
  Interpretations. As for People of Quality or others, who are
  indisposed, and do not care to come in Person, I can interpret their
  Dreams by seeing their Water. I set aside one Day in the Week for
  Lovers; and interpret by the great for any Gentlewoman who is turned
  of Sixty, after the rate of half a Crown <i>per</i> Week, with the usual
  Allowances for good Luck. I have several Rooms and Apartments fitted
  up, at reasonable rates, for such as have not Conveniences for
  dreaming at their own Houses.<br>

<br>
The following Essay is written by the Gentleman, to whom the World is
oblig'd for those several excellent Discourses which have been marked
with the Letter X.<br>
<br>
I have somewhere met with a Fable that made <i>Wealth</i> the Father of
<i>Love</i>. It is certain a Mind ought, at least, to be free from the
Apprehensions of Want and Poverty, before it can fully attend to all the
Softnesses and Endearments of this Passion. Notwithstanding we see
Multitudes of married People, who are utter Strangers to this delightful
Passion amidst all the Affluence of the most plentiful Fortunes.<br>
<br>
It is not sufficient to make a Marriage happy, that the Humours of two
People should be alike; I could instance an hundred Pair, who have not
the least Sentiment of Love remaining for one another, yet are so like
in their Humours, that if they were not already married, the whole World
would design them for Man and Wife.<br>
<br>
The Spirit of Love has something so extremely fine in it, that it is
very often disturbed and lost, by some little Accidents which the
Careless and Unpolite never attend to, till it is gone past Recovery.<br>
<br>
Nothing has more contributed to banish it from a married State, than too
great a Familiarity, and laying aside the common Rules of Decency. Tho'
I could give Instances of this in several Particulars, I shall only
mention that of <i>Dress</i>. The Beaus and Belles about Town, who dress
purely to catch one another, think there is no further occasion for the
Bait, when their first Design has succeeded. But besides the too common
Fault in point of Neatness, there are several others which I do not
remember to have seen touched upon, <a name="fr5061">but</a> in one of our modern Comedies<a href="#f5061"><sup>1</sup></a>, where a <i>French</i> Woman offering to undress and dress herself before
the Lover of the Play, and assuring his Mistress that it was very useful
in <i>France</i>, the Lady tells her that's a Secret in Dress she never knew
before, and that she was so unpolish'd an <i>English</i> Woman, as to resolve
never to learn even to dress before her Husband.<br>
<br>
There is something so gross in the Carriage of some Wives, that they
lose their Husbands Hearts for Faults, which, if a Man has either
Good-Nature or Good-Breeding, he knows not how to tell them of. I am
afraid, indeed, the Ladies are generally most faulty in this Particular,
who, at their first giving into Love, find the Way so smooth and
pleasant, that they fancy 'tis scarce possible to be tired in it.<br>
<br>
There is so much Nicety and Discretion requir'd to keep Love alive after
Marriage, and make Conversation still new and agreeable after twenty or
thirty years, that I know nothing which seems readily to promise it, but
an earnest endeavour to please on both sides, and superior good Sense on
the part of Man.<br>
<br>
By a Man of Sense, I mean one acquainted with Business and Letters.<br>
<br>
A Woman very much settles her Esteem for a Man, according to the Figure
he makes in the World, and the Character he bears among his own Sex. As
Learning is the chief Advantage we have over them, it is, methinks, as
scandalous and inexcusable for a Man of Fortune to be illiterate, as for
a Woman not to know how to behave her self on the most ordinary
Occasions. It is this which sets the two Sexes at the greatest Distance;
a Woman is vexed and surpriz'd, to find nothing more in the Conversation
of a Man, than in the common Tattle of her own Sex.<br>
<br>
Some small Engagement at least in Business, not only sets a Man's
Talents in the fairest Light, and allots him a Part to act, in which a
Wife cannot well intermeddle; but gives frequent occasions for those
little Absences, which, whatever seeming Uneasiness they may give, are
some of the best Preservatives of Love and De<b>Sir</b> e.<br>
<br>
<i>L&aelig;titia</i> is pretty, modest, tender, and has Sense enough; she married
<i>Erastus</i>, who is in a Post of some Business, and has a general Taste in
most Parts of polite Learning. <i>L&aelig;titia</i>, where ever she visits, has the
pleasure to hear of something which was handsomely said or done by
<i>Erastus</i>. <i>Erastus</i>, since his Marriage, is more gay in his Dress than
ever, and in all Companies is as complaisant to <i>L&aelig;titia</i> as to any
other Lady. I have seen him give her her Fan, when it has dropped, with
all the Gallantry of a Lover. When they take the Air together, <i>Erastus</i>
is continually improving her Thoughts, and with a Turn of Wit and Spirit
which is peculiar to him, giving her an Insight into things she had no
notion of before. <i>L&aelig;titia</i> is transported at having a new World thus
open'd to her, and hangs upon the Man that gives her such agreeable
Informations. <i>Erastus</i> has carried this Point still further, as he
makes her daily not only more fond of him, but infinitely more satisfied
with herself. <i>Erastus</i> finds a Justness or Beauty in whatever she says
or observes, that <i>L&aelig;titia</i> herself was not aware of; and, by his
Assistance, she has discovered an hundred good Qualities and
Accomplishments in herself, which she never before once dreamed of.
<i>Erastus</i>, with the most artful Complaisance in the World, by several
remote Hints, finds the means to make her say or propose almost whatever
he has a mind to, which he always receives as her own Discovery, and
gives her all the Reputation of it.<br>
<br>
<i>Erastus</i> has a perfect Taste in Painting, and carried <i>L&aelig;titia</i> with
him the other day to see a Collection of Pictures. I sometimes visit
this happy Couple. As we were last Week walking in the long Gallery
before Dinner, <i>I have lately laid out some Mony in Paintings</i>, says
<i>Erastus; I bought that</i> Venus <i>and</i> Adonis <i>purely upon</i> L&aelig;titia's
<i>Judgment; it <a name="fr5062">cost</a> me three-score Guineas, and I was this morning
offer'd <span style="color: #663300;">a</span><a href="#f5062"><sup>2</sup></a> hundred for it</i>. I turned towards <i>L&aelig;titia</i>, and saw her
Cheeks glow with Pleasure, while at the same time she cast a look upon
<i>Erastus</i>, the most tender and affectionate I ever beheld.<br>
<br>
<i>Flavilla</i> married <i>Tom Tawdry</i>; she was taken with his laced Coat and
rich Sword-knot; she has the mortification to see <i>Tom</i> despised by all
the worthy Part of his own Sex. <i>Tom</i> has nothing to do after Dinner,
but to determine whether he will pare his Nails at St. <i>James's,
White's</i>, or his own House. He has said nothing to <i>Flavilla</i> since they
were married, which she might not have heard as well from her own Woman.
He however takes great care to keep up the saucy ill-natur'd Authority
of a Husband. Whatever <i>Flavilla</i> happens to assert, <i>Tom</i> immediately
contradicts with an Oath, by way of Preface, and, <i>My Dear, I must tell
you, you talk most confoundedly silly. Flavilla</i> had a Heart naturally
as well dispos'd for all the Tenderness of Love as that of <i>L&aelig;titia</i>;
but as Love seldom continues long after Esteem, it is difficult to
determine, at present, whether the unhappy <i>Flavilla</i> hates or despises
the Person most, whom she is obliged to lead her whole Life with.<br>

There is something very Sublime, tho' very fanciful, in <i>Plato's</i>

to his Nature, as Error and Falshood. The Platonists have so just a
Notion of the Almighty's Aversion to every thing which is false and
erroneous, that they looked upon <i>Truth</i> as no less necessary than
<i>Virtue</i>, to qualifie an human Soul for the Enjoyment of a separate
State. For this reason as they recommended Moral Duties to qualifie and
season the Will for a future Life, so they prescribed several
Contemplations and Sciences to rectifie the Understanding. Thus <i>Plato</i>
has called Mathematical Demonstrations the Catharticks or Purgatives of
the Soul, as being the most proper Means to cleanse it from Error, and
to give it a Relish of Truth; which is the natural Food and Nourishment
of the Understanding, as Virtue is the Perfection and Happiness of the
Will.<br>
<br>
There are many Authors who have shewn wherein the Malignity of a <i>Lie</i>
consists, and set forth in proper Colours, the Heinousness of the
Offence. I shall here consider one Particular Kind of this Crime, which
has not been so much spoken to; I mean that abominable Practice of
<i>Party-lying</i>. This Vice is so very predominant among us at present,
that a Man is thought of no Principles, who does not propagate a certain
System of Lies. The Coffee-Houses are supported by them, the Press is
choaked with them, eminent Authors live upon them. Our
Bottle-Conversation is so infected with them, that a Party-Lie is grown
as fashionable an Entertainment, as a lively Catch or a merry Story: The
Truth of it is, half the great Talkers in the Nation would be struck
dumb, were this Fountain of Discourse dried up. There is however one
Advantage resulting from this detestable Practice; the very Appearances
of Truth are so little regarded, that Lies are at present discharg'd in
the Air, and begin to hurt no Body. When we hear a Party-story from a
Stranger, we consider whether he is a Whig or a Tory that relates it,
and immediately conclude they are Words of course, in which the honest
Gentleman designs to recommend his Zeal, without any Concern for his
Veracity. A Man is looked upon as bereft of common Sense, that gives
Credit to the Relations of Party-Writers; <span style="color: #663300;">nay</span> his own Friends shake
their Heads at him, and consider him in no other Light than as an
officious Tool or a well-meaning Ideot. When it was formerly the Fashion
to husband a Lie, and trump it up in some extraordinary Emergency, it
generally did Execution, and was not a little serviceable to the Faction
that made use of it; but at present every Man is upon his Guard, the
Artifice has been too often repeated to take Effect.<br>
<br>
I have frequently wonder'd to see Men of Probity, who would scorn to
utter a Falshood for their own particular Advantage, give so readily
into a Lie when it becomes the Voice of their Faction, notwithstanding
they are thoroughly sensible of it as such. How is it possible for those
who are Men of Honour in their Persons, thus to become notorious Liars
in their Party? If we look into the Bottom of this Matter, we may find,
I think, three Reasons for it, and at the same time discover the
Insufficiency of these Reasons to justify so Criminal a Practice.

In the first place, Men are apt to think that the Guilt of a Lie, and
consequently the Punishment, may be very much diminish'd, if not wholly
worn out, by the Multitudes of those who partake in it. Tho' the Weight
of a Falshood would be too heavy for <i>one</i> to bear, it grows light in
their Imaginations, when it is shared among <i>many</i>. But in this Case a
Man very much deceives himself; Guilt, when it spreads thro' numbers, is
not so properly divided as multiplied: Every one is criminal in
proportion to the Offence which he commits, not to the Number of those
who are his Companions in it. Both the Crime and the Penalty lie as
heavy upon every Individual of an offending Multitude, as they would
upon any single Person had none shared with him in the Offence. In a
word, the Division of Guilt is like that of Matter; tho' it may be
separated into infinite Portions, every Portion shall have the whole
Essence of Matter in it, and consist of as many Parts as the Whole did
before it was divided.<br>
<br>
But in the second place, tho' Multitudes, who join in a Lie, cannot
exempt themselves from the Guilt, they may from the Shame of it. The
Scandal of a Lie is in a manner lost and annihilated, when diffused
among several Thousands; as a Drop of the blackest Tincture wears away
and vanishes, when mixed and confused in a considerable Body of Water;
the Blot is still in it, but is not able to discover it self. This is
certainly a very great Motive to several Party-Offenders, who avoid
Crimes, not as they are prejudicial to their Virtue, but to their
Reputation. It is enough to shew the Weakness of this Reason, which
palliates Guilt without removing it, that every Man who is influenced by
it declares himself in effect an infamous Hypocrite, prefers the
Appearance of Virtue to its Reality, and is determined in his Conduct
neither by the Dictates of his own Conscience, the Suggestions of true
Honour, nor the Principles of Religion.<br>
<br>
The third and last great Motive for Mens joining in a popular Falshood,
or, as I have hitherto called it, a Party-Lie, notwithstanding they are
convinced of it as such, is the doing Good to a Cause which every Party
may be supposed to look upon as the most meritorious. The Unsoundness of
this Principle has been so often exposed, and is so universally
acknowledged, that a Man must be an utter Stranger to the Principles,
either of natural Religion or Christianity, who suffers himself to be
guided by it. If a Man might promote the supposed Good of his Country by
the blackest Calumnies and Falshoods, our Nation abounds more in
Patriots than any other of the Christian World. <a name="fr5071">When</a> <i>Pompey</i> was
de<b>Sir</b> ed not to set Sail in a Tempest that would hazard his Life, <i>It is
necessary for me</i>, says he, <i>to Sail, but it is not necessary for me to
Live</i><a href="#f5071"><sup>1</sup></a>: Every Man should say to himself, with the same Spirit, It is
my Duty to speak Truth, tho' it is not my Duty to be in an Office. One
of the Fathers hath carried this Point so high, as to declare, <i>He would
not tell a Lie, tho' he were sure to gain Heaven by it</i>. However
extravagant such a Protestation may appear, every one will own, that a
Man may say very reasonably, <i>He would not tell a Lie, if he were sure
to gain Hell by it</i>; or, if you have a mind to soften the Expression,
that he would not tell a Lie to gain any Temporal Reward by it, when he
should run the hazard of losing much more than it was possible for him
to gain.<br>

The following Letters complain of what I have frequently observed with
very much Indignation; therefore I shall give them to the Publick in the
Words with which my Correspondents, who suffer under the Hardships
mention'd in them, describe them.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'In former Ages all Pretensions to Dominion have been supported and
  submitted to, either upon Account of Inheritance, Conquest or
  Election; and all such Persons who have taken upon 'em any Soveraignty
  over their Fellow-Creatures upon any other Account, have been always
  called Tyrants, not so much because they were guilty of any particular
  Barbarities, as because every Attempt to such a Superiority was in its
  Nature tyrannical. But there is another sort of Potentates, who may
  with greater Propriety be call'd Tyrants, than those last mention'd,
  both as they assume a despotick Dominion over those as free as
  themselves, and as they support it by Acts of notable Oppression and
  Injustice; and these are the Rulers in all Clubs and Meetings. In
  other Governments, the Punishments of some have been alleviated by the
  Reward of others; but what makes the Reign of these Potentates so
  particularly grievous, is, that they are exquisite in punishing their
  Subjects, at the same time they have it not in their power to reward
  'em. That the Reader may the better comprehend the Nature of these
  Monarchs, as well as the miserable State of those that are their
  Vassals, I shall give an Account of the King of the Company I am
  fallen into, whom for his particular Tyranny I shall call
  <i>Dionysius</i>; as also of the Seeds that sprung up to this odd sort of
  Empire.<br>
<br>
  'Upon all Meetings at Taverns, 'tis necessary some one of the Company
  should take it upon him to get all things in such order and readiness,
  as may contribute as much as possible to the Felicity of the
  Convention; such as hastening the Fire, getting a sufficient number of
  Candles, tasting the Wine with a judicious Smack, fixing the Supper,
  and being brisk for the Dispatch of it. Know then, that <i>Dionysius</i>
  went thro' these Offices with an Air that seem'd to express a
  Satisfaction rather in serving the Publick, than in gratifying any
  particular Inclination of his own. We thought him a Person of an
  exquisite Palate, and therefore by consent beseeched him to be always
  our Proveditor; which Post, after he had handsomely denied, he could
  do no otherwise than accept. At first he made no other use of his
  Power, than in recommending such and such things to the Company, ever
  allowing these Points to be disputable; insomuch that I have often
  carried the Debate for Partridge, when his Majesty has given
  Intimation of the high Relish of Duck, but at the same time has
  chearfully submitted, and devour'd his Partridge with most gracious
  Resignation. This Submission on his side naturally produc'd the like
  on ours; of which he in a little time made such barbarous Advantage,
  as in all those Matters, which before seem'd indifferent to him, to
  issue out certain Edicts as uncontroulable and unalterable as the Laws
  of the <i>Medes</i> and <i>Persians</i>. He is by turns outragious, peevish,
  froward and jovial. He thinks it our Duty for the little Offices, as
  Proveditor, that in Return all Conversation is to be interrupted or
  promoted by his Inclination for or against the present Humour of the
  Company. We feel, at present, in the utmost Extremity, the Insolence
  of Office; however, I being naturally warm, ventur'd to oppose him in
  a Dispute about a Haunch of Venison. I was altogether for roasting,
  but <i>Dionysius</i> declar'd himself for boiling with so much Prowess and
  Resolution, that the Cook thought it necessary to consult his own
  Safety rather than the Luxury of my Proposition. With the same
  Authority that he orders what we shall eat and drink, he also commands
  us where to do it, and we change our Taverns according as he suspects
  any Treasonable Practices in the settling the Bill by the Master, or
  sees any bold Rebellion in point of Attendance by the Waiters. Another
  Reason for changing the Seat of Empire, I conceive to be the Pride he
  takes in the Promulgation of our Slavery, tho' we pay our Club for our
  Entertainments even in these Palaces of our grand Monarch. When he has
  a mind to take the Air, a Party of us are commanded out by way of
  Life-Guard, and we march under as great Restrictions as they do. If we
  meet a neighbouring King, we give or keep the Way according as we are
  outnumber'd or not; and if the Train of each is equal in number,
  rather than give Battle, the Superiority is soon adjusted by a
  Desertion from one of 'em.<br>
<br>
  'Now, the Expulsion of these unjust Rulers out of all Societies, would
  gain a Man as everlasting a Reputation, as either of the <i>Brutus's</i>
  got from their Endeavours to extirpate Tyranny from among the
  <i>Romans</i>. I confess my self to be in a Conspiracy against the Usurper
  of our Club; and to shew my Reading, as well as my merciful
  Disposition, shall allow him till the Ides of <i>March</i> to dethrone
  himself. If he seems to affect Empire till that time, and does not
  gradually recede from the Incursions he has made upon our Liberties,
  he shall find a Dinner dress'd which he has no Hand in, and shall be
  treated with an Order, Magnificence and Luxury as shall break his
  proud Heart; at the same time that he shall be convinc'd in his
  Stomach he was unfit for his Post, and a more mild and skilful Prince
  receive the Acclamations of the People, and be set up in his Room:
  <a name="fr5081">but</a>, as <i>Milton</i> says,

<blockquote><i>&mdash;These Thoughts<br>
Full Counsel must mature. Peace is despair'd,<br>
And who can think Submission? War, then War<br>
Open, or understood, must be resolved.</i><a href="#f5081"><sup>1</sup></a></blockquote>

  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'I am a young Woman at a Gentleman's Seat in the Country, who is a
  particular Friend of my Father's, and came hither to pass away a Month
  or two with his Daughters. I have been entertained with the utmost
  Civility by the whole Family, and nothing has been omitted which can
  make my Stay easy and agreeable on the Part of the Family; but there
  is a Gentleman here, a Visitant as I am, whose Behaviour has given me
  great Uneasinesses. When I first arrived here, he used me with the
  utmost Complaisance; but, forsooth, that was not with regard to my
  Sex, and since he has no Designs upon me, he does not know why he
  should distinguish me from a Man in things indifferent. He is, you
  must know, one of those familiar Coxcombs, who have observed some
  well-bred Men with a good Grace converse with Women, and say no fine
  things, but yet treat them with that sort of Respect which flows from
  the Heart and the Understanding, but is exerted in no Professions or
  Compliments. This Puppy, to imitate this Excellence, or avoid the
  contrary Fault of being troublesome in Complaisance, takes upon him to
  try his Talent upon me, insomuch that he contradicts me upon all
  Occasions, and one day told me I lied. If I had stuck him with my
  Bodkin, and behaved my self like a Man, since he won't treat me as a
  Woman, I had, I think, served him right. I wish, <b>Sir</b> , you would please
  to give him some Maxims of Behaviour in these Points, and resolve me
  if all Maids are not in point of Conversation to be treated by all
  Batchelors as their Mistresses? if not so, are they not to be used as
  gently as their Sisters? Is it sufferable, that the Fop of whom I
  complain should say, as he would rather have such a-one without a
  Groat, than me with the <i>Indies</i>? What right has any Man to make
  Suppositions of things not in his Power, and then declare his Will to
  the dislike of one that has never offended him? I assure you these are
  things worthy your Consideration, and I hope we shall have your
  Thoughts upon them. I am, tho' a Woman justly offended, ready to
  forgive all this, because I have no Remedy but leaving very agreeable
  Company sooner than I de<b>Sir</b> e. This also is an heinous Aggravation of
  his Offence, that he is inflicting Banishment upon me. Your printing
  this Letter may perhaps be an Admonition to reform him: As soon as it
  appears I will write my Name at the End of it, and lay it in his Way;
  the making which just Reprimand, I hope you will put in the Power of,<br>

The useful Knowledge in the following Letter shall have a Place in my
Paper, tho' there is nothing in it which immediately regards the Polite
or the Learned World; I say immediately, for upon Reflection every Man
will find there is a remote Influence upon his own Affairs, in the
Prosperity or Decay of the Trading Part of Mankind. My present
Correspondent, I believe, was never in Print before; but what he says
well deserves a general Attention, tho' delivered in his own homely
Maxims, and a Kind of Proverbial Simplicity; which Sort of Learning has
rais'd more Estates than ever were, or will be, from attention to
<i>Virgil, Horace, Tully, Seneca, Plutarch</i>, or any of the rest, whom, I
dare say, this worthy Citizen would hold to be indeed ingenious, but
unprofitable Writers. But to the Letter.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
<blockquote>  <i>Broadstreet, Oct.</i> 10, 1712.<br>
<br>
  <i>Mr.</i> WILLIAM SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  <b>Sir</b> ,<br>
<br>
  'I accuse you of many Discourses on the Subject of Money, which you
  have heretofore promis'd the Publick, but have not discharg'd your
  self thereof. But, forasmuch as you seem to depend upon Advice from
  others what to do in that Point, have sate down to write you the
  Needful upon that Subject. But, before I enter thereupon, I shall take
  this Opportunity to observe to you, that the thriving frugal Man shews
  it in every Part of his Expence, Dress, Servants, and House; and I
  must in the first place, complain to you, as SPECTATOR, that in these
  Particulars there is at this Time, throughout the City of <i>London</i>, a
  lamentable Change from that Simplicity of Manners, which is the true
  Source of Wealth and Prosperity. I just now said, the Man of Thrift
  shews Regularity in every thing; but you may, perhaps, laugh that I
  take Notice of such a Particular as I am going to do, for an Instance
  that this City is declining, if their antient &&oelig;lig;conomy is not
  restor'd. The Thing which gives me this Prospect, and so much Offence,
  is the Neglect of the <i>Royal-Exchange</i>, I mean the Edifice so called,
  and the Walks appertaining thereunto. The <i>Royal-Exchange</i> is a
  Fabrick that well deserves to be so called, as well to express that
  our Monarch's highest Glory and Advantage consists in being the
  Patrons of Trade, as that it is commodious for Business, and an
  Instance of the Grandeur both of Prince and People. But alas! at
  present it hardly seems to be set apart for any such Use or Purpose.
  Instead of the Assembly of honourable Merchants, substantial
  Tradesmen, and knowing Masters of Ships; the Mumpers, the Halt, the
  Blind, and the Lame; your Venders of Trash, Apples, Plumbs; your
  Ragamuffins, Rakeshames, and Wenches, have justled the greater Number
  of the former out of that Place. Thus it is, especially on the
  Evening-Change; so that what with the Din of Squalings, Oaths and
  Cries of Beggars, Men of the greatest Consequence in our City absent
  themselves from the Place. This Particular, by the way, is of evil
  Consequence; for if the Change be no Place for Men of the highest
  Credit to frequent, it will not be a Disgrace to those of less
  Abilities to absent. I remember the time when Rascally Company were
  kept out, and the unlucky Boys with Toys and Balls were whipped away
  by a Beadle. I have seen this done indeed of late, but then it has
  been only to chase the Lads from Chuck, that the Beadle might seize
  their Copper.<br>
<br>
  I must repeat the Abomination, that the Walnut Trade is carry'd on by
  old Women within the Walks, which makes the Place impassable by reason
  of Shells and Trash. The Benches around are so filthy, that no one can
  sit down, yet the Beadles and Officers have the Impudence at
  <i>Christmas</i> to ask for their Box, though they deserve the Strapado. I
  do not think it impertinent to have mentioned this, because it speaks
  a neglect in the Domestick Care of the City, and the Domestick is the
  truest Picture of a Man every where else.<br>
<br>
  But I designed to speak on the Business of Money and Advancement of
  Gain. The Man proper for this, speaking in the general, is of a
  sedate, plain, good Understanding, not apt to go out of his way, but
  so behaving himself at home, that Business may come to him. <b>Sir</b> 
  <i>William Turner</i>, that valuable Citizen, has left behind him a most
  excellent Rule, and couched it in very few Words, suited to the
  meanest Capacity. He would say, <i>Keep your Shop and your Shop will
  keep you</i>. It must be confessed, that if a Man of a great Genius could
  add Steadiness to his Vivacities, or substitute slower Men of Fidelity
  to transact the methodical part of his Affairs, such a one would
  outstrip the rest of the World: But Business and Trade is not to be
  managed by the same Heads which write Poetry, and make Plans for the
  Conduct of Life in general. So tho' we are at this day beholden to the
  late witty and inventive Duke of <i>Buckingham</i> for the whole Trade and
  Manufacture of Glass, yet I suppose there is no one will aver, that,
  were his Grace yet living, they would not rather deal with my diligent
  Friend and Neighbour, Mr. <i>Gumley</i>, for any Goods to be prepared and
  delivered on such a Day, than he would with that illustrious Mechanick
  abovementioned.<br>
<br>
  'No, no, <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR, you Wits must not pretend to be rich; and it
  is possible the Reason may be, in some Measure, because you despise,
  or at least you do not value it enough to let it take up your chief
  Attention; which the Trader must do, or lose his Credit, which is to
  him what Honour, Reputation, Fame, or Glory is to other sort of Men.<br>
<br>
  'I shall not speak to the Point of Cash it self, till I see how you
  approve of these my Maxims in general: But, I think, a Speculation
  upon <i>Many a Little makes a Mickle, A Penny sav'd is a Penny got,
  Penny wise and Pound foolish, It is Need that makes the old Wife
  trot</i>, would be very useful to the World, and if you treated them with
  Knowledge would be useful to your self, for it would make Demands for
  your Paper among those who have no Notion of it at present. But of
  these Matters more hereafter. If you did this, as you excel many
  Writers of the present Age for Politeness, so you would outgo the
  Author of the true Strops of Razors for Use.<br>
<br>
  'I shall conclude this Discourse with an Explanation of a Proverb,
  which by vulgar Errour is taken and used when a Man is reduced to an
  Extremity, whereas the Propriety of the Maxim is to use it when you
  would say, there is Plenty, but you must make such a Choice, as not to
  hurt another who is to come after you.<br>
<br>
  'Mr. <i>Tobias Hobson</i>, from whom we have the Expression, was a very
  honourable Man, for I shall ever call the Man so who gets an Estate
  honestly. Mr. <i>Tobias Hobson</i> was a Carrier, and being a Man of great
  Abilities and Invention, and one that saw where there might good
  Profit arise, though the duller Men overlooked it; this ingenious Man
  was the first in this Island who let out Hackney-Horses. He lived in
  <i>Cambridge</i>, and observing that the Scholars rid hard, his manner was
  to keep a large Stable of Horses, with Boots, Bridles, and Whips to
  furnish the Gentlemen at once, without going from College to College
  to borrow, as they have done since the Death of this worthy Man: I
  say, Mr. <i>Hobson</i> kept a Stable of forty good Cattle, always ready and
  fit for travelling; but when a Man came for a Horse, he was led into
  the Stable, where there was great Choice, but he obliged him to take
  the Horse which stood next to the Stable-Door; so that every Customer
  was alike well served according to his Chance, and every Horse ridden
  with the same Justice: From whence it became a Proverb, when what
  ought to be your Election was forced upon you, to say, <i>Hobson's
  Choice</i>. This memorable Man stands drawn in Fresco at an Inn (which he
  used) in <i>Bishopsgate-street</i>, with an hundred Pound Bag under his
  Arm, with this Inscription upon the said Bag,<br>
<br>
<blockquote><i>The fruitful Mother of an Hundred more.</i></blockquote>

  'Whatever Tradesman will try the Experiment, and begin the day after
  you publish this my Discourse to treat his Customers all alike, and
  all reasonably and honestly, I will ensure him the same Success.<br>

I am, <b>Sir</b> ,<br>

I <a name="fr5101">was</a> the other day driving in <span style="color: #663300;">a</span><a href="#f5101"><sup>1</sup></a> Hack thro' <i>Gerrard-street</i>, when
my Eye was immediately catch'd with the prettiest Object imaginable, the
Face of a very fair Girl, between Thirteen and Fourteen, fixed at the
Chin to a painted Sash, and made part of the Landskip. It seemed
admirably done, and upon throwing my self eagerly out of the Coach to
look at it, it laugh'd and flung from the Window. This amiable Figure
dwelt upon me; and I was considering the Vanity of the Girl, and her
pleasant Coquettry in acting a Picture till she was taken Notice of, and
raised the Admiration of her Beholders. This little Circumstance made me
run into Reflections upon the Force of Beauty, and the wonderful
Influence the Female Sex has upon the other part of the Species. Our
Hearts are seized with their Enchantments, and there are few of us, but
brutal Men, who by that Hardness lose the chief Pleasure in them, can
resist their Insinuations, tho' never so much against our own Interest
and Opinion. It is common with Women to destroy the good Effects a Man's
following his own Way and Inclination might have upon his Honour and
Fortune, by interposing their Power over him in matters wherein they
cannot influence him, but to his Loss and Disparagement. I do not know
therefore a Task so difficult in human Life, as to be proof against the
Importunities of a Woman a Man loves. There is certainly no Armour
against Tears, sullen Looks, or at best constrained Familiarities, in
her whom you usually meet with Transport and Alacrity. <b>Sir</b>  <i>Walter
Rawleigh</i> was quoted in a Letter (of a very ingenious Correspondent of
mine) on this Subject. That Author, who had lived in Courts, Camps,
travelled through many Countries, and seen many Men under several
Climates, and of as various Complections, speaks of our Impotence to
resist the Wiles of Women, in very severe Terms. <a name="fr5102">His</a> words are as

<blockquote><i>What Means did the Devil find out, or what Instruments did his own
  Subtlety present him, as fittest and aptest to work his Mischief by?
  Even the unquiet Vanity of the Woman; so as by</i> Adam's <i>hearkening to
  the Voice of his Wife, contrary to the express Commandment of the
  living God, Mankind by that her Incantation became the subject of
  Labour, Sorrow, and Death; the Woman being given to Man for a
  Comforter and Companion, but not for a Counsellor. It is also to be
  noted by whom the Woman was tempted; even by the most ugly and
  unworthy of all Beasts, into whom the Devil entered and persuaded.
  Secondly, What was the Motive of her Disobedience? Even a de<b>Sir</b> e to
  know what was most unfitting her Knowledge; an Affection which has
  ever since remained in all the Posterity of her Sex. Thirdly, What was
  it that moved the Man to yield to her Persuasions; even the same Cause
  which hath moved all Men since to the like Consent, namely, an
  Unwillingness to grieve her or make her sad, lest she should pine, and
  be overcome with Sorrow. But if</i> Adam <i>in the state of Perfection,
  and</i> Solomon <i>the Son of</i> David, <i>God's chosen Servant, and himself a
  Man endued with the greatest Wisdom, did both of them disobey their
  Creator by the Persuasion and for the Love they bare to a Woman, it is
  not so wonderful as lamentable, that other Men in succeeding Ages have
  been allured to so many inconvenient and wicked Practices by the
  Persuasion of their Wives, or other beloved Darlings, who cover over
  and shadow many malicious Purposes with a counterfeit Passion of
  dissimulate Sorrow and Unquietness.</i></blockquote>

The Motions of the Minds of Lovers are no where so well described, as in
the Works of skillful Writers for the Stage. The Scene between <i>Fulvia</i>
and <i>Curius</i>, in the second Act of <i>Johnson's Catiline</i>, is an excellent
Picture of the Power of a Lady over her Gallant. The Wench plays with
his Affections; and as a Man of all Places in the World wishes to make a
good Figure with his Mistress, upon her upbraiding him with Want of
Spirit, he alludes to Enterprizes which he cannot reveal but with the
Hazard of his Life. When he is worked thus far, with a little Flattery
of her Opinion of his Gallantry, and de<b>Sir</b> e to know more of it out of
her overflowing Fondness to him, he brags to her till his Life is in her
Disposal.<br>
<br>
When a Man is thus liable to be vanquished by the Charms of her he
loves, the safest Way is to determine what is proper to be done, but to
avoid all Expostulation with her before he executes what he has
resolved. Women are ever too hard for us upon a Treaty, and one must
consider how senseless a thing it is to argue with one whose Looks and
Gestures are more prevalent with you, than your Reason and Arguments can
be with her. It is a most miserable Slavery to submit to what you
disapprove, and give up a Truth for no other Reason, but that you had
not Fortitude to support you in asserting it. A Man has enough to do to
conquer his own unreasonable Wishes and De<b>Sir</b> es; but he does that in
vain, if he has those of another to gratify. Let his Pride be in his
Wife and Family, let him give them all the Conveniences of Life in such
a manner as if he were proud of them; but let it be his own innocent
Pride, and not their exorbitant De<b>Sir</b> es, which are indulged by him. In
this case all the little Arts imaginable are used to soften a Man's
Heart, and raise his Passion above his Understanding; but in all
Concessions of this Kind, a Man should consider whether the Present he
makes flows from his own Love, or the Importunity of his Beloved: If
from the latter, he is her Slave; if from the former, her Friend. We
laugh it off, and do not weigh this Subjection to Women with that
Seriousness which so important a Circumstance deserves. Why was Courage
given to Man, if his Wife's Fears are to frustrate it? When this is once
indulged, you are no longer her Guardian and Protector, as you were
designed by Nature; but, in Compliance to her Weaknesses, you have
disabled your self from avoiding the Misfortunes into which they will
lead you both, and you are to see the Hour in which you are to be
reproached by her self for that very Complaisance to her. It is indeed
the most difficult Mastery over our selves we can possibly attain, to
resist the Grief of her who charms us; but let the Heart ake, be the
Anguish never so quick and painful, it is what must be suffered and
passed through, if you think to live like a Gentleman, or be conscious
to your self that you are a Man of Honesty. The old Argument, that <i>You
do not love me if you deny me this</i>, which first was used to obtain a
Trifle, by habitual Success will oblige the unhappy Man who gives Way to
it, to resign the Cause even of his Country and his Honour.<br>

  <i>Dear</i> SPEC.<br>
<br>
  'Finding that my last Letter took, I do intend to continue my
  epistolary Correspondence with thee, on those dear confounded
  Creatures, <i>Women</i>. Thou knowest, all the little Learning I am Master
  of is upon that Subject; I never looked in a Book, but for their
  sakes. I have lately met with two pure Stories for a <i>Spectator</i>,
  which I am sure will please mightily, if they pass through thy Hands.
  The first of them I found by chance in a <i>English</i> Book
  called <i>Herodotus</i>, that lay in my Friend <i>Dapperwit's</i> Window, as I
  visited him one Morning. It luckily opened in the Place where I met
  with the following Account. He tells us that it was the Manner among
  the <i>Persians</i> to have several Fairs in the Kingdom, at which all the
  young unmarried Women were annually exposed to Sale. The Men who
  wanted Wives came hither to provide themselves: Every Woman was given
  to the highest Bidder, and the Mony which she fetched laid aside for
  the publick Use, to be employed as thou shalt hear by and by. By this
  means the richest People had the Choice of the Market, and culled out
  all the most extraordinary Beauties. As soon as the Fair was thus
  picked, the Refuse was to be distributed among the Poor, and among
  those who could not go to the Price of a <i>Beauty</i> Several of these
  married the <i>Agreeables</i>, without paying a Farthing for them, unless
  somebody chanced to think it worth his while to bid for them, in which
  Case the best Bidder was always the Purchaser. But now you must know,
  <b>Spec</b>. it happened in <i>Persia</i> as it does in our own Country, that
  there were as many <i>ugly Women</i>, as <i>Beauties</i> or <i>Agreeables;</i> so
  that by Consequence, after  the Magistrates had put off a great many,
  there were still a great many that stuck upon their Hands. In order
  therefore to clear the Market, the Money which the Beauties had sold
  for, was disposed of among the Ugly; so that a poor Man, who could not
  afford to have a Beauty for his Wife, was forced to take up with a
  Fortune; the greatest Portion being always given to the most Deformed.
  To this the Author adds, that every poor Man was forced to live kindly
  with his Wife, or in case he repented of his Bargain, to return her
  Portion with her to the next publick Sale.<br>
<br>
  What I would recommend to thee on this Occasion is, to establish such
  an imaginary Fair in <i>Great Britain</i>: Thou couldst make it very
  pleasant, by matching Women of Quality with Coblers and Carmen, or
  describing Titles and Garters leading off in great Ceremony
  Shop-keepers and Farmers Daughters. Tho' to tell thee the Truth, I am
  confoundedly afraid that as the love of Mony prevails in our Island
  more than it did in <i>Persia</i>, we should find that some of our greatest
  Men would chuse out the Portions, and rival one another for the
  richest Piece of Deformity; and that on the contrary, the Toasts and
  Belles would be bought up by extravagant Heirs, Gamesters and
  Spendthrifts. Thou couldst make very pretty Reflections upon this
  Occasion in Honour of the <i>Persian</i> Politicks, who took care, by such
  Marriages, to beautify the upper part of the Species, and to make the
  greatest Persons in the Government the most graceful. But this I shall
  leave to thy judicious Pen.<br>
<br>
  'I have another Story to tell thee, which I likewise met with in a
  Book. It seems the General of the <i>Tartars</i>, after having laid siege
  to a strong Town in <i>China</i>, and taken it by Storm, would set to Sale
  all the Women that were found in it. Accordingly, he put each of them
  into a Sack, and after having thoroughly considered the Value of the
  Woman who was inclosed, marked the Price that was demanded for her
  upon the Sack. There were a great Confluence of Chapmen, that resorted
  from every Part, with a Design to purchase, which they were to do
  <i>unsight unseen</i>. The Book mentions a Merchant in particular, who
  observing one of the Sacks to be marked pretty high, bargained for it,
  and carried it off with him to his House. As he was resting with it
  upon a half-way Bridge, he was resolved to take a Survey of his
  Purchase: Upon opening the Sack, a little old Woman popped her Head
  out of it; at which the Adventurer was in so great a Rage, that he was
  going to shoot her out into the River. The old Lady, however, begged
  him first of all to hear her Story, by which he learned that she was
  sister to a great <i>Mandarin</i>, who would infallibly make the Fortune of
  his Brother-in-Law as soon as he should know to whose Lot she fell.
  Upon which the Merchant again tied her up in his Sack, and carried her
  to his House, where she proved an excellent Wife, and procured him all
  the Riches from her Brother that she had promised him.<br>
<br>
  'I fancy, if I was disposed to dream a second time, I could make a
  tolerable Vision upon this Plan. I would suppose all the unmarried
  Women in <i>London</i> and <i>Westminster</i> brought to Market in Sacks, with
  their respective Prices on each Sack. The first Sack that is sold is
  marked with five thousand Pound: Upon the opening of it, I find it
  filled with an admirable Housewife, of an agreeable Countenance: The
  Purchaser, upon hearing her good Qualities, pays down her Price very
  chearfully. The second I would open, should be a five hundred Pound
  Sack: The Lady in it, to our surprize, has the Face and Person of a
  Toast: As we are wondering how she came to be set at so low a Price,
  we hear that she would have been valued at ten thousand Pound, but
  that the Publick had made those Abatements for her being a Scold. I
  would afterwards find some beautiful, modest, and discreet Woman, that
  should be the top of the Market; and perhaps discover half a dozen
  Romps tyed up together in the same Sack, at one hundred Pound an Head.
  The Prude and the Coquet should be valued at the same Price, tho' the
  first should go off the better of the two. I fancy thou wouldst like
  such a Vision, had I time to finish it; because, to talk in thy own
  way, there is a Moral in it. Whatever thou may'st think of it,
  pr'ythee do not make any of thy queer Apologies for this Letter, as
  thou didst for my last. The Women love a gay lively Fellow, and are
  never angry at the Railleries of one who is their known Admirer. I am
  always bitter upon them, but well with them.<br>

<br>

There is nothing which we receive with so much Reluctance as Advice. We
look upon the Man who gives it us as offering an Affront to our
Understanding, and treating us like Children or Ideots. We consider the
Instruction as an implicit Censure, and the Zeal which any one shews for
our Good on such an Occasion as a Piece of Presumption or Impertinence.
The Truth of it is, the Person who pretends to advise, does, in that
particular, exercise a Superiority over us, and can have no other Reason
for it, but that in comparing us with himself, he thinks us defective
either in our Conduct or our Understanding. For these Reasons, there is
nothing so difficult as the Art of making Advice agreeable; and indeed
all the Writers, both Ancient and Modern, have distinguished themselves
among one another, according to the Perfection at which they have
arrived in this Art. How many Devices have been made use of, to render
this bitter Potion palatable? Some convey their Instructions to us in
the best chosen Words, others in the most harmonious Numbers, some in
Points of Wit, and others in short Proverbs.<br>
<br>
But among all the different Ways of giving Counsel, I think the finest,
and that which pleases the most universally, is <i>Fable</i>, in whatsoever
shape it appears. If we consider this way of instructing or giving
Advice, it excels all others, because it is the least shocking, and the
least subject to those Exceptions which I have before mentioned.<br>
<br>
This will appear to us, if we reflect in the first place, that upon the
reading of a Fable we are made to believe we advise ourselves. We peruse
the Author for the sake of the Story, and consider the Precepts rather
as our own Conclusions, than his Instructions. The Moral insinuates it
self imperceptibly, we are taught by Surprise, and become wiser and
better unawares. In short, by this method a Man is so far over-reached
as to think he is directing himself, whilst he is following the Dictates
of another, and consequently is not sensible of that which is the most
unpleasing Circumstance in Advice.<br>
<br>
In the next place, if we look into human Nature, we shall find that the
Mind is never so much pleased, as when she exerts her self in any Action
that gives her an Idea of her own Perfections and Abilities. This
natural Pride and Ambition of the Soul is very much gratified in the
reading of a Fable: for in Writings of this kind, the Reader comes in
for half of the Performance; every thing appears to him like a Discovery
of his own; he is busied all the while in applying Characters and
Circumstances, and is in this respect both a Reader and a Composer. It
is no wonder therefore that on such Occasions, when the Mind is thus
pleased with it self, and amused with its own Discoveries, that it is
highly delighted with the Writing which is the occasion of it. <a name="fr5121">For</a> this
reason the <i>Absalom</i> and <i>Achitophel</i><a href="#f5121"><sup>1</sup></a> was one of the most popular
Poems that ever appeared in <i>English</i>. The poetry is indeed very fine,
but had it been much finer, it would not have so much pleased, without a
plan which gave the Reader an Opportunity of exerting his own Talents.<br>
<br>
This oblique manner of giving Advice is so inoffensive, that if we look
into ancient Histories, we find the wise Men of old very often chose to
give Counsel to their Kings in Fables. To omit many which will occur to
every one's Memory, <a name="fr5122">there</a> is a pretty Instance of this Nature in a
<i>Turkish</i> Tale, which I do not like the worse for that little Oriental
Extravagance which is mixed with it.<br>
<br>
We are told that the Sultan <i>Mahmoud</i>, by his perpetual Wars abroad, and
his Tyranny at home, had filled his Dominions with Ruin and Desolation,
and half unpeopled the <i>Persian</i> Empire. The Visier to this great Sultan
(whether an Humourist or an Enthusiast, we are not informed) pretended
to have learned of a certain Dervise to understand the Language of
Birds, so that there was not a Bird that could open his Mouth, but the
Visier knew what it was he said. As he was one Evening with the Emperor,
in their return from Hunting, they saw a couple of Owls upon a Tree that
grew near an old Wall out of an Heap of Rubbish. <i>I would fain know</i>,
says the Sultan, <i>what those two Owls are saying to one another; listen
to their Discourse, and give me an account of it</i>. The Visier approached
the Tree, pretending to be very attentive to the two Owls. Upon his
return to the Sultan, <i><b>Sir</b> </i>, says he, <i>I have heard part of their
Conversation, but dare not tell you what it is</i>. The Sultan would not be
satisfied with such an Answer, but forced him to repeat word for word
every thing the Owls had said. <i>You must know then</i>, said the
Visier, <i>that one of these Owls has a Son, and the other a Daughter,
between whom they are now upon a Treaty of Marriage. The Father of the
Son said to the Father of the Daughter, in my hearing, Brother, I
consent to this Marriage, provided you will settle upon your Daughter
fifty ruined Villages for her Portion. To which the Father of the
Daughter replied, Instead of fifty I will give her five hundred, if you
please. God grant a long Life to Sultan</i> Mahmoud; <i>whilst he reigns over
us, we shall never want ruined Villages</i>.<br>
<br>
The Story says, the Sultan was so touched with the Fable, that he
rebuilt the Towns and Villages which had been destroyed, and from that
time forward consulted the Good of his People<a href="#f5122"><sup>2</sup></a>.<br>
<br>
To fill up my Paper, I shall add a most ridiculous piece of natural
Magic, which was taught by no less a Philosopher than <i>Democritus</i>,
namely, that if the Blood of certain Birds, which he mentioned, were
mixed together, it would produce a Serpent of such a wonderful Virtue,
that whoever did eat it should be skill'd in the Language of Birds, and
understand every thing they said to one another. Whether the Dervise
abovementioned might not have eaten such a Serpent, I shall leave to the
Determinations of the Learned.<br>

The following Letter comes to me from that excellent Man in Holy Orders,
whom I have mentioned more than once as one of that Society who assist
me in my Speculations. It is a <i>Thought in Sickness</i>, and of a very
serious Nature, for which Reason I give it a place in the Paper of this
Day.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <i><b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  'The <a name="fr5131">Indisposition</a> which has long hung upon me, is at last grown to
  such <span style="color: #663300;">a</span><a href="#f5131"><sup>1</sup></a> Head, that it must quickly make an End of me, or of it
  self. You may imagine, that whilst I am in this bad state of Health,
  there are none of your Works which I read with greater Pleasure than
  your <i>Saturday's</i> Papers. I should be very glad if I could furnish you
  with any Hints for that Day's Entertainment. Were I able to dress up
  several Thoughts of a serious nature, which have made great
  Impressions on my Mind during a long Fit of Sickness, they might not
  be an improper Entertainment for that Occasion.<br>
<br>
  'Among all the Reflections which usually rise in the Mind of a sick
  Man, who has Time and Inclination to consider his approaching End,
  there is none more natural than that of his going to appear Naked and
  Unbodied before Him who made him. When a Man considers, that as soon
  as the vital Union is dissolved, he shall see that Supreme Being, whom
  he now contemplates at a Distance, and only in his Works; or, to speak
  more philosophically, when by some Faculty in the Soul he shall
  apprehend the Divine Being, and be more sensible of his Presence, than
  we are now of the Presence of any Object which the Eye beholds, a Man
  must be lost in Carelessness and Stupidity, who is not alarmed at such
  a Thought. Dr. <i>Sherlock</i>, in his excellent Treatise upon Death, has
  represented, in very strong and lively Colours, the State of the Soul
  in its first Separation from the Body, with regard to that invisible
  World which every where surrounds us, tho' we are not able to discover
  it through this grosser World of Matter, which is accommodated to our
  Senses in this Life. His Words are as follow.

  <blockquote><i>That Death, which is our leaving this World, is nothing else but our
  putting off these Bodies, teaches us, that it is only our Union to
  these Bodies, which intercepts the sight of the other World: The other
  World is not at such a distance from us, as we may imagine; the Throne
  of God indeed is at a great remove from this Earth, above the third
  Heavens, where he displays his Glory to those blessed Spirits which
  encompass his Throne; but as soon as we step out of these Bodies, we
  step into the other World, which is not so properly another World,
  (for there is the same Heaven and Earth still) as a new state of Life.
  To live in these Bodies is to live in this World; to live out of them
  is to remove into the next: For while our Souls are confined to these
  Bodies, and can look only thro' these material Casements, nothing but
  what is material can affect us; nay, nothing but what is so gross,
  that it can reflect Light, and convey the Shapes and Colours of Things
  with it to the Eye: So that though within this visible World, there be
  a more glorious Scene of Things than what appears to us, we perceive
  nothing at all of it; for this Veil of Flesh parts the visible and
  invisible World: But when we put off these Bodies, there are new and
  surprizing Wonders present themselves to our Views; when these
  material Spectacles are taken off, the Soul, with its own naked Eyes,
  sees what was invisible before: And then we are in the other World,
  when we can see it, and converse with it: Thus St.</i> Paul <i>tell us,
  That</i> when we are at home in the Body, we are absent from the Lord;
  but when we are absent from the Body, we are present with the Lord, 2
  <i>Cor.</i> 5. 6, 8. <i>And methinks this is enough to cure us of our
  Fondness for these Bodies, unless we think it more de<b>Sir</b> able to be
  confined to a Prison, and to look through a Grate all our Lives, which
  gives us but a very narrow prospect, and that none of the best
  neither, than to be set at liberty to view all the Glories of the
  World. What would we give now for the least Glimpse of that invisible
  World, which the first step we take out of these Bodies will present
  us with? There are such things</i> as Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard,
  neither hath it entered into the Heart of Man to conceive: <i>Death
  opens our Eyes, enlarges our Prospect, presents us with a new and more
  glorious World, which we can never see while we are shut up in Flesh;
  which should make us as willing to part with this Veil, as to take the
  Film off of our Eyes, which hinders our Sight.</i></blockquote>

  'As a thinking Man cannot but be very much affected with the Idea of
  his appearing in the presence of that Being <i>whom none can see and
  live</i>; he must be much more affected when he considers that this Being
  whom he appears before, will examine all the Actions of his past Life,
  and reward or punish him accordingly. I must confess that I think
  there is no Scheme of Religion, besides that of Christianity, which
  can possibly support the most virtuous Person under this Thought. Let
  a Man's Innocence be what it will, let his Virtues rise to the highest
  pitch of Perfection attainable in this Life, there will be still in
  him so many secret Sins, so many human Frailties, so many Offences of
  Ignorance, Passion and Prejudice, so many unguarded Words and
  Thoughts, and in short, so many Defects in his best Actions, that,
  without the Advantages of such an Expiation and Atonement as
  Christianity has revealed to us, it is impossible that he should be
  cleared before his Sovereign Judge, or that he should be able <i>to
  stand in his Sight</i>. Our Holy Religion suggests to us the only Means
  whereby our Guilt may be taken away, and our imperfect Obedience
  accepted.<br>

<blockquote><i>Me Parnassi deserta per ardua, dulcis<br>
Raptat Amor; juvat ire jugis qua nulla priorum<br>
Castaliam molle divertitur Orbita Clivo.</i><br><br>

Virg.<a href="transindex.html#514t"><img src="images/qmark.png" width="15" height="15" align="right" alt="translation"></a><br>
<br>

<br>
  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'I came home a little later than usual the other Night, and not
  finding my self inclined to sleep, I took up <i>Virgil</i> to divert me
  till I should be more disposed to Rest. He is the Author whom I always
  chuse on such Occasions, no one writing in so divine, so harmonious,
  nor so equal a Strain, which leaves the Mind composed, and softened
  into an agreeable Melancholy; the Temper in which, of all others, I
  chuse to close the Day. The Passages I turned to were those beautiful
  Raptures in his <i>Georgicks</i>, where he professes himself entirely given
  up to the Muses, and smit with the Love of Poetry, passionately
  wishing to be transported to the cool Shades and Retirements of the
  Mountain <i>H&aelig;mus</i>. I clos'd the Book and went to Bed. What I had just
  before been reading made so strong an Impression on my Mind, that
  Fancy seemed almost to fulfil to me the Wish of <i>Virgil</i>, in
  presenting to me the following Vision.<br>
<br>
  'Methought I was on a sudden plac'd in the Plains of <i>Boeotia</i>, where
  at the end of the Horizon I saw the Mountain <i>Parnassus</i> rising before
  me. The Prospect was of so large an Extent, that I had long wander'd
  about to find a Path which should directly lead me to it, had I not
  seen at some distance a Grove of Trees, which in a Plain that had
  nothing else remarkable enough in it to fix my Sight, immediately
  determined me to go thither. When I arrived at it, I found it parted
  out into a great Number of Walks and Alleys, which often widened into
  beautiful Openings, as Circles or Ovals, set round with Yews and
  Cypresses, with Niches, Grotto's, and Caves placed on the Sides,
  encompassed with Ivy. There was no Sound to be heard in the whole
  Place, but only that of a gentle Breeze passing over the Leaves of the
  Forest, every thing beside was buried in a profound Silence. I was
  captivated with the Beauty and Retirement of the Place, and never so
  much, before that Hour, was pleased with the Enjoyment of my self. I
  indulged the Humour, and suffered my self to wander without Choice or
  Design. At length, at the end of a Range of Trees, I saw three Figures
  seated on a Bank of Moss, with a silent Brook creeping at their Feet.
  I ador'd them as the tutelar Divinities of the Place, and stood still
  to take a particular View of each of them. The Middlemost, whose Name
  was <i>Solitude</i>, sat with her Arms across each other, and seemed rather
  pensive and wholly taken up with her own Thoughts, than any ways
  grieved or displeased. The only Companions which she admitted into
  that Retirement, was the Goddess <i>Silence</i>, who sat on her right Hand
  with her Finger on her Mouth, and on her left <i>Contemplation</i>, with
  her Eyes fixed upon the Heavens. Before her lay a celestial Globe,
  with several Schemes of Mathematical Theorems. She prevented my Speech
  with the greatest Affability in the World: Fear not, said she, I know
  your Request before you speak it; you would be led to the Mountain of
  the Muses; the only way to it lies thro' this Place, and no one is so
  often employ'd in conducting Persons thither as my self. When she had
  thus spoken, she rose from her Seat, and I immediately placed my self
  under her Direction; but whilst I passed through the Grove, I could
  not help enquiring of her who were the Persons admitted into that
  sweet Retirement. Surely, said I, there can nothing enter here but
  Virtue and virtuous Thoughts: The whole Wood seems design'd for the
  Reception and Reward of such Persons as have spent their Lives
  according to the Dictates of their Conscience and the Commands of the
  Gods. You imagine right, said she; assure your self this Place was at
  first designed for no other: Such it continued to be in the Reign of
  <i>Saturn</i>, when none entered here but holy Priests, Deliverers of their
  Country from Oppression and Tyranny, who repos'd themselves here after
  their Labours, and those whom the Study and Love of Wisdom had fitted
  for divine Conversation. But now it is become no less dangerous than
  it was before de<b>Sir</b> able: Vice has learned so to mimick Virtue, that it
  often creeps in hither under its Disguise. See there! just before you,
  <i>Revenge</i> stalking by, habited in the Robe of <i>Honour</i>. Observe not
  far from him <i>Ambition</i> standing alone; if you ask him his Name, he
  will tell you it is <i>Emulation</i> or <i>Glory</i>. But the most frequent
  Intruder we have is <i>Lust</i>, who succeeds now the Deity to whom in
  better Days this Grove was entirely devoted. <i>Virtuous Love</i>, with
  <i>Hymen</i>, and the Graces attending him, once reign'd over this happy
  Place; a whole Train of Virtues waited on him, and no dishonourable
  Thought durst presume for Admittance: But now! how is the whole
  Prospect changed? and how seldom renewed by some few who dare despise
  sordid Wealth, and imagine themselves fit Companions for so charming a
  Divinity?<br>
<br>
  'The Goddess had no sooner said thus, but we were arriv'd at the
  utmost Boundaries of the Wood, which lay contiguous to a Plain that
  ended at the Foot of the Mountain. Here I kept close to my Guide,
  being sollicited by several Phantomes, who assured me they would shew
  me a nearer Way to the Mountain of the Muses. Among the rest <i>Vanity</i>
  was extremely importunate, having deluded infinite Numbers, whom I saw
  wandering at the Foot of the Hill. I turned away from this despicable
  Troop with Disdain, and addressing my self to my Guide, told her, that
  as I had some Hopes I should be able to reach up part of the Ascent,
  so I despaired of having Strength enough to attain the Plain on the
  Top. But being informed by her that it was impossible to stand upon
  the Sides, and that if I did not proceed onwards, I should
  irrecoverably fall down to the lowest Verge, I resolved to hazard any
  Labour and Hardship in the Attempt: So great a de<b>Sir</b> e had I of
  enjoying the Satisfaction I hoped to meet with at the End of my
  Enterprize!<br>
<br>
  'There were two Paths, which led up by different Ways to the Summit of
  the Mountain; the one was guarded by the Genius which presides over
  the Moment of our Births. He had it in charge to examine the several
  Pretensions of those who de<b>Sir</b> ed a Pass that Way, but to admit none
  excepting those only on whom <i>Melpomene</i> had look'd with a propitious
  Eye at the Hour of their Nativity. The other Way was guarded by
  <i>Diligence</i>, to whom many of those Persons apply'd who had met with a
  Denial the other Way; but he was so tedious in granting their Request,
  and indeed after Admittance the Way was so very intricate and
  laborious, that many after they had made some Progress, chose rather
  to return back than proceed, and very few persisted so long as to
  arrive at the End they proposed. Besides these two Paths, which at
  length severally led to the Top of the Mountain, there was a third
  made up of these two, which a little after the Entrance joined in one.
  This carried those happy Few, whose good Fortune it was to find it,
  directly to the Throne of <i>Apollo</i>. I don't know whether I should even
  now have had the Resolution to have demanded Entrance at either of
  these Doors, had I not seen a Peasant-like Man (followed by a numerous
  and lovely Train of Youths of both Sexes) insist upon Entrance for all
  whom he led up. He put me in mind of the Country Clown who is painted
  in the Map for leading Prince <i>Eugene</i> over the <i>Alps</i>. He had a
  Bundle of Papers in his Hand, and producing several, which he said,
  were given to him by Hands which he knew <i>Apollo</i> would allow as
  Passes; among which, methoughts, I saw some of my own Writing; the
  whole Assembly was admitted, and gave, by their Presence, a new Beauty
  and Pleasure to these happy Mansions. I found the Man did not pretend
  to enter himself, but served as a kind of Forester in the Lawns to
  direct Passengers, who by their own Merit, or Instructions he procured
  for them, had Virtue enough to travel that way. I looked very
  attentively upon this kind homely Benefactor, and forgive me, <i>Mr.</i>
  SPECTATOR, if I own to you I took him for your self. We were no sooner
  entered, but we were sprinkled three times with the Water of the
  Fountain <i>Aganippe</i>, which had Power to deliver us from all Harms, but
  only Envy, which reached even to the End of our Journey. We had not
  proceeded far in the middle Path when we arrived at the Summit of the
  Hill, where there immediately appeared to us two Figures, which
  extremely engaged my Attention: the one was a young Nymph in the Prime
  of her Youth and Beauty; she had Wings on her Shoulders and Feet, and
  was able to transport herself to the most distant Regions in the
  smallest Space of Time. She was continually varying her Dress,
  sometimes into the most natural and becoming Habits in the World, and
  at others into the most wild and freakish Garb that can be imagined.
  There stood by her a Man full-aged, and of great Gravity, who
  corrected her Inconsistences, by shewing them in his Mirror, and still
  flung her affected and unbecoming Ornaments down the Mountain, which
  fell in the Plain below, and were gathered up and wore with great
  Satisfaction by those that inhabited it. The Name of the Nymph was
  <i>Fancy</i>, the Daughter of <i>Liberty</i>, the most beautiful of all the
  Mountain-Nymphs. The other was <i>Judgment</i>, the Off-spring of <i>Time</i>,
  and the only Child he acknowledged to be his. A Youth, who sat upon a
  Throne just between them, was their genuine Offspring; his Name was
  <i>Wit</i>, and his Seat was composed of the Works of the most celebrated
  Authors. I could not but see with a secret Joy, that though the
  <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i> made the Majority, yet our own Countrymen were
  the next both in Number and Dignity. I was now at Liberty to take a
  full Prospect of that delightful Region. I was inspired with new
  Vigour and Life, and saw every thing in nobler and more pleasing Views
  than before; I breathed a purer &AElig;ther in a Sky which was a continued
  Azure, gilded with perpetual Sunshine. The two Summits of the Mountain
  rose on each Side, and formed in the midst a most delicious Vale, the
  Habitation of the Muses, and of such as had composed Works worthy of
  Immortality. <i>Apollo</i> was seated upon a Throne of Gold, and for a
  Canopy an aged Laurel spread its Boughs and its Shade over his Head.
  His Bow and Quiver lay at his Feet. He held his Harp in his Hand,
  whilst the Muses round about him celebrated with Hymns his Victory
  over the Serpent <i>Python</i>, and sometimes sung in softer Notes the
  Loves of <i>Leucothoe</i> and <i>Daphnis</i>. <i>Homer</i>, <i>Virgil</i>, and <i>Milton</i>
  were seated the next to them. Behind were a great Number of others,
  among whom I was surprized to see some in the Habit of <i>Laplanders</i>,
  who, notwithstanding the Uncouthness of their Dress, had lately
  obtained a Place upon the Mountain. I saw <i>Pindar</i> walking all alone,
  no one daring to accost him, till <i>Cowley</i> join'd himself to him; but
  growing weary of one who almost walked him out of breath, he left him
  for <i>Horace</i> and <i>Anacreon</i>, with whom he seemed infinitely delighted.<br>
<br>
  'A little further I saw another Groupe of Figures; I made up to them,
  and found it was <i>Socrates</i> dictating to <i>Xenophon</i>, and the Spirit of
  <i>Plato</i>; but most of all, <i>Musoeus</i> had the greatest Audience about
  him. I was at too great a Distance to hear what he said, or to
  discover the Faces of his Hearers; only I thought I now perceived
  <i>Virgil</i>, who had joined them, and stood in a Posture full of
  Admiration at the Harmony of his Words.<br>
<br>
  'Lastly, At the very Brink of the Hill I saw <i>Boccalini</i> sending
  Dispatches to the World below of what happened upon <i>Parnassus</i>; but I
  perceived he did it without leave of the Muses, and by stealth, and
  was unwilling to have them revised by <i>Apollo</i>. I could now from this
  Height and serene Sky behold the infinite Cares and Anxieties with
  which Mortals below sought out their way through the Maze of Life. I
  saw the Path of Virtue lie strait before them, whilst Interest, or
  some malicious Demon, still hurry'd them out of the Way. I was at once
  touched with Pleasure at my own Happiness, and Compassion at the sight
  of their inextricable Errors. Here the two contending Passions rose so
  high, that they were inconsistent with the sweet Repose I enjoy'd, and
  awaking with a sudden start, the only Consolation I could admit of for
  my Loss, <a name="fr5142">was</a> the Hopes that this Relation of my Dream will not
  displease you.'<a href="#f5142"><sup>2</sup></a>

  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'I am obliged to you for printing the Account I lately sent you of a
  Coquet who disturbed a sober Congregation in the City of <i>London</i>.
  That Intelligence ended at her taking Coach, and bidding the Driver go
  where he knew. I could not leave her so, but dogged her, as hard as
  she drove, to <i>Paul's</i> Church-Yard, where there was a Stop of Coaches
  attending Company coming out of the Cathedral. This gave me
  opportunity to hold up a Crown to her Coachman, who gave me the
  Signal, that he would hurry on, and make no Haste, as you know the Way
  is when they favour a Chase. By his many kind Blunders, driving
  against other Coaches, and slipping off some of his Tackle, I could
  keep up with him, and lodged my fine Lady in the Parish of St.
  <i>James's</i>. As I guessed when I first saw her at Church, her Business
  is to win Hearts and throw 'em away, regarding nothing but the
  Triumph. I have had the Happiness, by tracing her through all with
  whom I heard she was acquainted, to find one who was intimate with a
  Friend of mine, and to be introduced to her Notice. I have made so
  good use of my Time, as to procure from that Intimate of hers one of
  her Letters, which she writ to her when in the Country. This Epistle
  of her own may serve to alarm the World against her in ordinary Life,
  as mine, I hope, did those, who shall behold her at Church. The Letter
  was written last Winter to the Lady who gave it me; and I doubt not
  but you will find it the Soul of an happy self-loving Dame, that takes
  all the Admiration she can meet with, and returns none of it in Love
  to her Admirers.'

<blockquote>    <i>Dear Jenny</i>,<br>
<br>
    "I am glad to find you are likely to be dispos'd of in Marriage so
    much to your Approbation as you tell me. You say you are afraid only
    of me, for I shall laugh at your Spouse's Airs. I beg of you not to
    fear it, for I am too nice a Discerner to laugh at any, but whom
    most other People think fine Fellows; so that your Dear may bring
    you hither as soon as his Horses are in Case enough to appear in
    Town, and you be very safe against any Raillery you may apprehend
    from me; for I am surrounded with Coxcombs of my own making, who are
    all ridiculous in a manner: your Good-man, I presume, can't exert
    himself. As Men <a name="fr5151">who</a> cannot raise their Fortunes, and are uneasy
    under the Incapacity of shining in Courts, rail at Ambition; so do
    <span style="color: #663300;">awkard</span><a href="#f5151"><sup>1</sup></a> and insipid Women, who cannot warm the Hearts and charm
    the Eyes of Men, rail at Affectation: But she that has the Joy of
    seeing a Man's Heart leap into his Eyes at beholding her, is in no
    Pain for want of Esteem among a Crew of that Part of her own Sex,
    who have no Spirit but that of Envy, and no Language but that of
    Malice. I do not in this, I hope, express my self insensible of the
    Merit of <i>Leodacia</i>, who lowers her Beauty to all but her Husband,
    and never spreads her Charms but to gladden him who has a Right in
    them: I say, I do Honour to those who can be Coquets, and are not
    such; but I despise all who would be so, and in Despair of arriving
    at it themselves, hate and vilify all those who can. But, be that as
    it will, in Answer to your De<b>Sir</b> e of knowing my History: One of my
    chief present Pleasures is in Country-Dances: and, in Obedience to
    me, as well as the Pleasure of coming up to me with a good Grace,
    shewing themselves in their Address to others in my Presence, and
    the like Opportunities, they are all Proficients that Way: And I had
    the Happiness of being the other Night where we made six Couple, and
    every Woman's Partner a profess'd Lover of mine. The wildest
    Imagination cannot form to it self on any Occasion, higher Delight
    than I acknowledge my self to have been in all that Evening. I chose
    out of my Admirers a Set of Men who most love me, and gave them
    Partners of such of my own Sex who most envy'd me.<br>
<br>
    "My way is, when any Man who is my Admirer pretends to give himself
    Airs of Merit, as at this Time a certain Gentleman you know did, to
    mortify him by favouring in his Presence the most insignificant
    Creature I can find. At this Ball I was led into the Company by
    pretty Mr. <i>Fanfly</i>, who, you know, is the most obsequious,
    well-shaped, well-bred Woman's Man in Town. I at first Entrance
    declared him my Partner if I danced at all; which put the whole
    Assembly into a Grin, as forming no Terrours from such a Rival. But
    we had not been long in the Room, before I overheard the meritorious
    Gentleman above-mention'd say with an Oath, There is no Raillery in
    the Thing, she certainly loves the Puppy. My Gentleman, when we were
    dancing, took an Occasion to be very soft in his Oglings upon a Lady
    he danced with, and whom he knew of all Women I love most to
    outshine. The Contest began who should plague the other most. I, who
    do not care a Farthing for him, had no hard Task to out-vex him. I
    made <i>Fanfly</i>, with a very little Encouragement, cut Capers
    <i>Coupee</i>, and then sink with all the Air and Tenderness imaginable.
    When he perform'd this, I observed the Gentleman you know of fall
    into the same way, and imitate as well as he could the despised
    <i>Fanfly</i>. I cannot well give you, who are so grave a Country Lady,
    the Idea of the Joy we have when we see a stubborn Heart breaking,
    or a Man of Sense turning Fool for our sakes; but this happened to
    our Friend, and I expect his Attendance whenever I go to Church, to
    Court, to the Play, or the Park. This is a Sacrifice due to us Women
    of Genius, who have the Eloquence of Beauty, an easie Mein. I mean
    by an easie Mein, one which can be on Occasion easily affected: For
    I must tell you, dear <i>Jenny</i>, I hold one Maxim, which is an
    uncommon one, to wit, That our greatest Charms are owing to
    Affectation. 'Tis to That that our Arms can lodge so quietly just
    over our Hips, and the Fan can play without any Force or Motion but
    just of the Wrist. 'Tis to Affectation we owe the pensive Attention
    of <i>Deidamia</i> at a Tragedy, the scornful Approbation of <i>Dulciamara</i>
    at a Comedy, and the lowly Aspect of <i>Lanquicelsa</i> at a Sermon.<br>
<br>
    "To tell you the plain Truth, I know no Pleasure but in being
    admir'd, and have yet never failed of attaining the Approbation of
    the Man whose Regard I had a Mind to. You see all the Men who make a
    Figure in the World (as wise a Look as they are pleased to put upon
    the Matter) are moved by the same Vanity as I am. What is there in
    Ambition, but to make other People's Wills depend upon yours? This
    indeed is not to be aim'd at by one who has a Genius no higher than
    to think of being a very good Housewife in a Country Gentleman's
    Family. The Care of Poultrey and Piggs are great Enemies to the
    Countenance: The vacant Look of a fine Lady is not to be preserved,
    if she admits any thing to take up her Thoughts but her own dear
    Person. But I interrupt you too long from your Cares, and my self
    from my Conquests."<br>
<br>
<i>I am, Madam, Your most humble Servant</i>. </blockquote>

Of all the monstrous Passions and Opinions which have crept into the
World, there is none so wonderful as that those who profess the common
Name of <i>Christians</i>, should pursue each other with Rancour and Hatred
for Differences in their Way of following the Example of their Saviour.
It seems so natural that all who pursue the Steps of any Leader should
form themselves after his Manners, that it is impossible to account for
Effects so different from what we might expect from those who profess
themselves Followers of the highest Pattern of Meekness and Charity, but
by ascribing such Effects to the Ambition and Corruption of those who
are so audacious, with Souls full of Fury, to serve at the Altars of the
God of Peace.<br>
<br>
The Massacres to which the Church of <i>Rome</i> has animated the ordinary
People, are dreadful Instances of the Truth of this Observation; and
whoever reads the History of the <i>Irish</i> Rebellion, and the Cruelties
which ensued thereupon, will be sufficiently convinced to what Rage poor
Ignorants may be worked up by those who profess Holiness, and become
Incendiaries, and under the Dispensation of Grace, promote Evils
abhorrent to Nature.<br>
<br>
This Subject and Catastrophe, which deserve so well to be remarked by
the Protestant World, will, I doubt not, be considered by the Reverend
and Learned Prelate that Preaches to-morrow before many of the
Descendants, of those who perished on that lamentable Day, in a manner
suitable to the Occasion, and worthy his own great Virtue and Eloquence.<br>
<br>
I shall not dwell upon it any further, but only transcribe out of a
little Tract, called, <i>The Christian Hero</i>, published in 1701, what I
find there in Honour of the renowned Hero <i>William</i> III. who rescued
that Nation from the Repetition of the same Disasters. His late Majesty,
of glorious Memory, and the most Christian King, are considered at the
Conclusion of that Treatise as Heads of the Protestant and Roman
Catholick World in the following Manner.

<blockquote>  'There were not ever, before the Entrance of the Christian Name into
  the World, Men who have maintained a more renowned Carriage, than the
  two great Rivals who possess the full Fame of the present Age, and
  will be the Theme and Examination of the future. They are exactly
  form'd by Nature for those Ends to which Heaven seems to have sent
  them amongst us: Both animated with a restless De<b>Sir</b> e of Glory, but
  pursue it by different Means, and with different Motives. To one it
  consists in an extensive undisputed Empire over his Subjects, to the
  other in their rational and voluntary Obedience: One's Happiness is
  founded in their want of Power, the other's in their want of De<b>Sir</b> e to
  oppose him. The one enjoys the Summit of Fortune with the Luxury of a
  <i>Persian</i>, the other with the Moderation of a <i>Spartan</i>: One is made
  to oppress, the other to relieve the Oppressed: The one is satisfy'd
  with the Pomp and Ostentation of Power to prefer and debase his
  Inferiours, the other delighted only with the Cause and Foundation of
  it to cherish and protect 'em. To one therefore Religion is but a
  convenient Disguise, to the other a vigorous Motive of Action.<br>
<br>
  'For without such Ties of real and solid Honour, there is no way of
  forming a Monarch, but after the Machiavillian Scheme, by which a
  Prince must ever seem to have all Virtues, but really to be Master of
  none, but is to be liberal, merciful and just, only as they serve his
  Interests; while, with the noble Art of Hypocrisy, Empire would be to
  be extended, and new Conquests be made by new Devices, by which prompt
  Address <a name="fr5161">his</a> Creatures might insensibly give Law in the Business of
  Life, by leading Men in the Entertainment of it<a href="#f5161"><sup>1</sup></a>.<br>
<br>
  'Thus when Words and Show are apt to pass for the substantial things
  they are only to express, there would need no more to enslave a
  Country but to adorn a Court; for while every Man's Vanity makes him
  believe himself capable of becoming Luxury, Enjoyments are a ready
  Bait for Sufferings, and the Hopes of Preferment Invitations to
  Servitude; which Slavery would be colour'd with all the Agreements, as
  they call it, imaginable. The noblest Arts and Artists, the finest
  Pens and most elegant Minds, jointly employ'd to set it off, with the
  various Embellishments of sumptuous Entertainments, charming
  Assemblies, and polished Discourses; and those apostate Abilities of
  Men, the adored Monarch might profusely and skilfully encourage, while
  they flatter his Virtue, and gild his Vice at so high a rate, that he,
  without Scorn of the one, or Love of the other, would alternately and
  occasionally use both: So that his Bounty should support him in his
  Rapines, his Mercy in his Cruelties.<br>
<br>
  'Nor is it to give things a more severe Look than is natural, to
  suppose such must be the Consequences of a Prince's having no other
  Pursuit than that of his own Glory; for, if we consider an Infant born
  into the World, and beholding it self the mightiest thing in it, it
  self the present Admiration and future Prospect of a fawning People,
  who profess themselves great or mean, according to the Figure he is to
  make amongst them, what Fancy would not be debauched to believe they
  were but what they professed themselves, his mere Creatures, and use
  them as such by purchasing with their Lives a boundless Renown, which
  he, for want of a more just Prospect, would place in the Number of his
  Slaves, and the Extent of his Territories? Such undoubtedly would be
  the tragical Effects of a Prince's living with no Religion, which are
  not to be surpassed but by his having a false one.<br>
<br>
  'If Ambition were spirited with Zeal, what would follow, but that his
  People should be converted into an Army, whose Swords can make Right
  in Power, and solve Controversy in Belief? And if Men should be
  stiff-neck'd to the Doctrine of that visible Church, let them be
  contented with an Oar and a Chain, in the midst of Stripes and
  Anguish, to contemplate on him, <i>whose Yoke is easy, and whose Burthen
  is light</i>.<br>
<br>
  'With a Tyranny begun on his own Subjects, and Indignation that others
  draw their Breath independent of his Frown or Smile, why should he not
  proceed to the Seizure of the World? And if nothing but the Thirst of
  Sway were the Motive of his Actions, why should Treaties be other than
  mere Words, or solemn national Compacts be any thing but an Halt in
  the March of that Army, who are never to lay down their Arms, till all
  Men are reduc'd to the necessity of hanging their Lives on his wayward
  Will; who might supinely, and at leisure, expiate his own Sins by
  other Mens Sufferings, while he daily meditates new Slaughter, and new
  Conquest?<br>
<br>
  'For mere Man, when giddy with unbridled Power, is an insatiate Idol,
  not to be appeased with Myriads offer'd to his Pride, which may be
  puffed up by the Adulation of a base and prostrate World, into an
  Opinion that he is something more than human, by being something less:
  And, alas, what is there that mortal Man will not believe of himself,
  when complimented with the Attributes of God? Can he then conceive
  Thoughts of a Power as <i>Omnipresent</i> as his! But should there be such
  a Foe of Mankind now upon Earth, have our Sins so far provoked Heaven,
  that we are left utterly naked to his Fury? Is there no Power, no
  Leader, no Genius, that can conduct and animate us to our Death or our
  Defence? Yes; our great God never gave one to feign by his Permission,
  but he gave to another also to reign by his Grace.<br>
<br>
  'All the Circumstances of the illustrious Life of our Prince, seem to
  have conspired to make him the Check and Bridle of Tyranny; for his
  Mind has been strengthened and confirmed by one continual Struggle,
  and Heaven has educated him by Adversity to a quick Sense of the
  Distresses and Miseries of Mankind, which he was born to redress: In
  just scorn of the trivial Glories and light Ostentations of Power,
  that glorious Instrument of Providence moves, like that, in a steddy,
  calm, and silent Course, independent either of Applause or Calumny;
  which renders him, if not in a political, yet in a moral, a
  philosophick, an heroick, and a Christian Sense, an absolute Monarch;
  who satisfy'd with this unchangeable, just, and ample Glory, must
  needs turn all his Regards from himself to the Service of others; for
  he begins his Enterprize with his own Share in the Success of them;
  for Integrity bears in it self its Reward, nor can that which depends
  not on Event ever know Disappointment.<br>
<br>
  'With the undoubted Character of a glorious Captain, and (what he much
  more values than the most splendid Titles) that of a sincere and
  honest Man, he is the Hope and Stay of <i>Europe</i>, an universal Good not
  to be engrossed by us only, for distant Potentates implore his
  Friendship, and injur'd Empires court his Assistance. He rules the
  World, not by an Invasion of the People of the Earth, but the Address
  of its Princes; and if that World should be again rous'd from the
  Repose which his prevailing Arms had given it, why should we not hope
  that there is an Almighty, by whose Influence the terrible Enemy that
  thinks himself prepar'd for Battel, may find he is but ripe for
  Destruction? and that there may be in the Womb of Time great
  Incidents, which may make the Catastrophe of a prosperous Life as
  unfortunate as the particular Scenes of it were successful? For there
  does not want a skilful Eye and resolute Arm to observe and grasp the

We last night received a Piece of ill News at our Club, which very
sensibly afflicted every one of us. I question not but my Readers
themselves will be troubled at the hearing of it. <a name="fr5171">To</a> keep them no longer
in Suspence, <b>Sir</b>  <b>Roger De Coverly</b><i> is dead.</i><a href="#f5171"><sup>1</sup></a> He departed this Life
at his House in the Country, after a few Weeks Sickness. <b>Sir</b>  <b>Andrew
Freeport</b> has a Letter from one of his Correspondents in those Parts,
that informs him the old Man caught a Cold at the County-Sessions, as he
was very warmly promoting an Address of his own penning, in which he
succeeded according to his Wishes, But this Particular comes from a
Whig-Justice of Peace, who was always <b>Sir</b>  <b>Roger's</b> Enemy and Antagonist.
I have Letters both from the Chaplain and Captain <i>Sentry</i> which mention
nothing of it, but are filled with many Particulars to the Honour of the
good old Man. I have likewise a Letter from the Butler, who took so much
care of me last Summer when I was at the Knight's House. As my Friend
the Butler mentions, in the Simplicity of his Heart, several
Circumstances the others have passed over in Silence, I shall give my
Reader a Copy of his Letter, without any Alteration or Diminution.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote> <i>Honoured <b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  'Knowing that you was my old Master's good Friend, I could not forbear
  sending you the melancholy News of his Death, which has afflicted the
  whole Country, as well as his poor Servants, who loved him, I may say,
  better than we did our Lives. I am afraid he caught his Death the last
  County Sessions, where he would go to see Justice done to a poor Widow
  Woman, and her Fatherless Children, that had been wronged by a
  neighbouring Gentleman; for you know, <b>Sir</b> , my good Master was always
  the poor Man's Friend. Upon his coming home, the first Complaint he
  made was, that he had lost his Roast-Beef Stomach, not being able to
  touch a <b>Sir</b> loin, which was served up according to Custom; and you know
  he used to take great Delight in it. From that time forward he grew
  worse and worse, but still kept a good Heart to the last. <a name="fr5172">Indeed</a> we
  were once in great <span style="color: #663300;">Hope</span><a href="#f5172"><sup>2</sup></a> of his Recovery, upon a kind Message
  that was sent him from the Widow Lady whom he had made love to the
  Forty last Years of his Life; but this only proved a Light'ning before
  Death. He has bequeathed to this Lady, as a token of his Love, a great
  Pearl Necklace, and a Couple of Silver Bracelets set with Jewels,
  which belonged to my good old Lady his Mother: He has bequeathed the
  fine white Gelding, that he used to ride a hunting upon, to his
  Chaplain, because he thought he would be kind to him, and has left you
  all his Books. He has, moreover, bequeathed to the Chaplain a very
  pretty Tenement with good Lands about it. It being a very cold Day
  when he made his Will, he left for Mourning, to every Man in the
  Parish, a great Frize-Coat, and to every Woman a black Riding-hood. It
  was a most moving Sight to see him take leave of his poor Servants,
  commending us all for our Fidelity, whilst we were not able to speak a
  Word for weeping. As we most of us are grown Gray-headed in our Dear
  Master's Service, he has left us Pensions and Legacies, which we may
  live very comfortably upon, the remaining part of our Days.<br>
<br>
  He has bequeath'd a great deal more in Charity, which is not yet come
  to my Knowledge, and it is peremptorily said in the Parish, that he
  has left Mony to build a Steeple to the Church; for he was heard to
  say some time ago, that if he lived two Years longer, <i>Coverly</i> Church
  should have a Steeple to it. The Chaplain tells every body that he
  made a very good End, and never speaks of him without Tears. He was
  buried according to his own Directions, among the Family of the
  <i>Coverly's</i>, on the Left Hand of his Father <b>Sir</b>  <i>Arthur</i>. The Coffin
  was carried by Six of his Tenants, and the Pall held up by Six of the
  <i>Quorum</i>: The whole Parish follow'd the Corps with heavy Hearts, and
  in their Mourning Suits, the Men in Frize, and the Women in
  Riding-Hoods. Captain <b>Sentry</b>, my Master's Nephew, has taken Possession
  of the Hall-House, and the whole Estate. When my old Master saw him a
  little before his Death, he shook him by the Hand, and wished him Joy
  of the Estate which was falling to him, de<b>Sir</b> ing him only to make good
  Use of it, and to pay the several Legacies, and the Gifts of Charity
  which he told him he had left as Quitrents upon the Estate. The
  Captain truly seems a courteous Man, though he says but little. He
  makes much of those whom my Master loved, and shews great Kindness to
  the old House-dog, that you know my poor Master was so fond of. It
  would have gone to your Heart to have heard the Moans the dumb
  Creature made on the Day of my Master's Death. He has ne'er joyed
  himself since; no more has any of us. 'Twas the melancholiest Day for
  the poor People that ever happened in <i>Worcestershire</i>. This being all
  from,<br>
<br>
  <i>Honoured <b>Sir</b> ,<br>
<br>
  Your most Sorrowful Servant</i>,<br>

  Edward Biscuit.<br>

  <i>P. S.</i> 'My Master de<b>Sir</b> ed, some Weeks before he died, that a Book
  which comes up to you by the Carrier should be given to <b>Sir</b>  <i>Andrew
  Freeport</i>, in his Name.'</blockquote><br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
This Letter, notwithstanding the poor Butler's Manner of writing it,
gave us such an Idea of our good old Friend, that upon the reading of it
there was not a dry Eye in the Club. <b>Sir</b>  <i>Andrew</i> opening the Book,
found it to be a Collection of Acts of Parliament. There was in
particular the Act of Uniformity, with some Passages in it marked by <b>Sir</b> 
<i>Roger's</i> own Hand. <b>Sir</b>  <i>Andrew</i> found that they related to two or three
Points, which he had disputed with <b>Sir</b>  <i>Roger</i> the last time he appeared
at the Club. <b>Sir</b>  <i>Andrew</i>, who would have been merry at such an Incident
on another Occasion, at the sight of the old Man's Hand-writing burst
into Tears, and put the Book into his Pocket. Captain <i>Sentry</i> informs
me, that the Knight has left Rings and Mourning for every one in the
Club.<br>
<br>
O.<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
<a name="f5171"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote 1:</span></a> &nbsp; In No. 1 of the <i>Bee</i> (for February, 1733) Eustace Budgell,
who set up that publication, and who probably was the intimate friend of
Addison's to whom he there refers, said of <b>Sir</b>  Roger de Coverley, 

 <blockquote> 'Mr. Addison was so fond of this character that a little before he
  laid down the <i>Spectator</i> (foreseeing that some nimble gentleman would
  catch up his pen the moment he quitted it) he said to an intimate
  friend, with a certain warmth in his expression which he was not often
  guilty of, By God, I'll kill <b>Sir</b>  Roger, that nobody else may murder
  him.' </blockquote>
  
Accordingly the whole <i>Spectator</i> No. 517 consists of nothing but an
account of the old knight's death, and some moving circumstances which
attended it. Steele had by this date resolved on bringing his <i>Spectator</i>
to a close, and Addison's paper on the death of <b>Sir</b>  Roger, the first of
several which are to dispose of all members of the <b>Spectator's</b> Club and
break up the Club itself, was the first clear warning to the public that
he had such an intention.<br>

This being a Day of Business with me, I must make the present
Entertainment like a Treat at an House-warming, out of such Presents as
have been sent me by my Guests. The first Dish which I serve up is a
Letter come fresh to my Hand.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote><i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  It is with inexpressible Sorrow that I hear of the Death of good <b>Sir</b> 
  <i>Roger</i>, and do heartily condole with you upon so melancholy an
  Occasion. I think you ought to have blacken'd the Edges of a Paper
  which brought us so ill News, and to have had it stamped likewise in
  Black. It is expected of you that you should write his Epitaph, and,
  if possible, fill his Place in the Club with as worthy and diverting a
  Member. I question not but you will receive many Recommendations from
  the publick of such as will appear Candidates for that Post.<br>
<br>
  Since I am talking of Death, and have mentioned an Epitaph, I must
  tell you, <b>Sir</b> , that I have made discovery of a Church-Yard in which I
  believe you might spend an Afternoon, with great Pleasure to your self
  and to the Publick: It. belongs to the Church of <i>Stebon-Heath</i>,
  commonly called <i>Stepney</i>. Whether or no it be that the People of that
  Parish have a particular Genius for an Epitaph, or that there be some
  Poet among them who undertakes that Work by the Great, I can't tell;
  but there are more remarkable Inscriptions in that place than in any
  other I have met with, and I may say without Vanity, that there is not
  a Gentleman in <i>England</i> better read in Tomb-stones than my self, my
  Studies having laid very much in Church-yards. I shall beg leave to
  send you a Couple of Epitaphs, for a Sample of those I have just now
  mentioned. They are written in a different manner; the first being in
  the diffused and luxuriant, the second in the close contracted Style.
  The first has much of the Simple and Pathetick; the second is
  something Light, but Nervous. The first is thus:

<blockquote><i>Here</i> Thomas Sapper <i>lyes interred. Ah why!<br>
    Born in</i> New England, <i>did in</i> London <i>dye;<br>
    Was the third Son of Eight, begot upon<br>
    His Mother</i> Martha <i>by his Father</i> John.<br>
    <i>Much favoured by his Prince he 'gan to be,<br>
    But nipt by Death at th' Age of Twenty Three.<br>
    Fatal to him was that we Small-pox name,<br>
    By which his Mother and two Brethren came<br>
    Also to breathe their last nine Years before,<br>
    And now have left their Father to deplore<br>
    The loss of all his Children, with his Wife,<br>
    Who was the Joy and Comfort of his Life.</i></blockquote>

The Second is as follows:

<blockquote><i>Here lies the body of</i> Daniel Saul,<br>
  Spittle-fields <i>weaver, and that's all.</i></blockquote>

  'I will not dismiss you, whilst I am upon this Subject, without
  sending a short Epitaph which I once met with, though I cannot
  possibly recollect the Place. The Thought of it is serious, and in my
  Opinion, the finest that I ever met with upon this Occasion. You know,
  <b>Sir</b> , it is usual, after having told us the Name of the Person who lies
  interr'd to lanch out into his Praises. <a name="fr5182">This</a> Epitaph takes a quite
  contrary Turn, having been made by the Person himself some time before
  his Death.

<blockquote><i>Hic jacet</i> R. C. <i>in expectatione diei supremi. Qualis erat dies
  iste indicabit.</i><a href="#f5182"><sup>2</sup></a><br>
<br>
Here lieth <i>R. C</i>. in expectation of the last Day. What sort
of a Man he was, that Day will discover. </blockquote>

<a name="fr5183">The</a> following Letter is dated from <i>Cambridge</i><a href="#f5183"><sup>3</sup></a>.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote><i><b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  'Having lately read among your Speculations, an Essay upon
  Phisiognomy, I cannot but think that if you made a Visit to this
  ancient University, you might receive very considerable Lights upon
  that Subject, there being scarce a young Fellow in it who does not
  give certain Indications of his particular Humour and Disposition
  conformable to the Rules of that Art. In Courts and Cities every body
  lays a Constraint upon his Countenance, and endeavours to look like
  the rest of the World; but the Youth of this Place, having not yet
  formed themselves by Conversation, and the Knowledge of the World,
  give their Limbs and Features their full Play.<br>
<br>
  'As you have considered Human Nature in all its Lights, you must be
  extremely well apprized, that there is a very close Correspondence
  between the outward and the inward Man; that scarce the least Dawning,
  the least Parturiency towards a Thought can be stirring in the Mind of
  Man, without producing a suitable Revolution in his Exteriors, which
  will easily discover it self to an Adept in the Theory of the Phiz.
  Hence it is, that the intrinsick Worth and Merit of a Son of <i>Alma
  Mater</i> is ordinarily calculated from the Cast of his Visage, the
  Contour of his Person, the Mechanism of his Dress, the Disposition of
  his Limbs, the Manner of his Gate and Air, with a number of
  Circumstances of equal Consequence and Information: The Practitioners
  in this Art often make use of a Gentleman's Eyes to give 'em Light
  into the Posture of his Brains; take a Handle from his Nose, to judge
  of the Size of his Intellects; and interpret the over-much Visibility
  and Pertness of one Ear, as an infallible mark of Reprobation, and a
  Sign the Owner of so saucy a Member fears neither God nor Man. In
  conformity to this Scheme, a contracted Brow, a lumpish down-cast
  Look, a sober sedate Pace, with both Hands dangling quiet and steddy
  in Lines exactly parallel to each Lateral Pocket of the Galligaskins,
  is Logick, Metaphysicks and Mathematicks in Perfection. So likewise
  the <i>Belles Lettres</i> are typified by a Saunter in the Gate; a Fall of
  one Wing of the Peruke backward, an Insertion of one Hand in the Fobb,
  and a negligent Swing of the other, with a Pinch of right and fine
  <i>Barcelona</i> between Finger and Thumb, a due Quantity of the same upon
  the upper Lip, and a Noddle-Case loaden with Pulvil. Again, a grave
  solemn stalking Pace is Heroick Poetry, and Politicks; an Unequal one,
  a Genius for the Ode, and the modern Ballad: and an open Breast, with
  an audacious Display of the Holland Shirt, is construed a fatal
  Tendency to the Art Military.<br>
<br>
  'I might be much larger upon these Hints, but I know whom I write to.
  If you can graft any Speculation upon them, or turn them to the
  Advantage of the Persons concerned in them, you will do a Work very
  becoming the <i>British Spectator</i>, and oblige'<br>
<br>
  <i>Your very Humble Servant</i>,<br>

Though there is a great deal of Pleasure in contemplating the material
World, by which I mean that System of Bodies into which Nature has so
curiously wrought the Mass of dead Matter, with the several Relations
which those Bodies bear to one another; there is still, methinks,
something more wonderful and surprizing in Contemplations on the World
of Life, by which I mean all those Animals with which every Part of the
Universe is furnished. The Material World is only the Shell of the
Universe: The World of Life are its Inhabitants.<br>
<br>
If we consider those parts of the Material World which lie the nearest
to us, and are therefore subject to our Observations and Enquiries, it
is amazing to consider the Infinity of Animals with which it is stocked.
Every part of Matter is peopled: Every green Leaf swarms with
Inhabitants. There is scarce a single Humour in the Body of a Man, or of
any other Animal, in which our Glasses do not discover Myriads of living
Creatures. The Surface of Animals is also covered with other Animals,
which are in the same manner the Basis of other Animals, that live upon
it; nay, we find in the most solid Bodies, as in Marble it self,
innumerable Cells and Cavities that are crouded with such imperceptible
Inhabitants, as are too little for the naked Eye to discover. On the
other hand, if we look into the more bulky parts of Nature, we see the
Seas, Lakes and Rivers teeming with numberless kinds of living
Creatures: We find every Mountain and Marsh, Wilderness and Wood,
plentifully stocked with Birds and Beasts, and every part of Matter
affording proper Necessaries and Conveniencies for the Livelihood of
Multitudes which inhabit it.<br>
<br>
<a name="fr5191">The</a> Author of the <i>Plurality of Worlds</i><a href="#f5191"><sup>1</sup></a> draws a very good Argument
from this Consideration, for the <i>peopling</i> of every Planet; as indeed
it seems very probable from the Analogy of Reason, that if no Part of
Matter, which we are acquainted with, lies waste and useless, those
great Bodies which are at such a Distance from us should not be desart
and unpeopled, but rather that they should be furnished with Beings
adapted to their respective Situations.<br>
<br>
Existence is a Blessing to those Beings only which are endowed with
Perception, and is in a manner thrown away upon dead Matter, any further
than as it is subservient to Beings which are conscious of their
Existence. Accordingly we find, from the Bodies which lie under our
Observation, that Matter is only made as the Basis and Support of
Animals, and that there is no more of the one, than what is necessary
for the Existence of the other.<br>
<br>
Infinite Goodness <a name="fr5192">is</a> of so communicative a nature, that it seems to
delight in the conferring of Existence upon every Degree of <span style="color: #663300;">Perceptive</span><a href="#f5192"><sup>2</sup></a> Being. As this is a Speculation, which I have often pursued with
great Pleasure to my self, I shall enlarge farther upon it, by
considering that part of the Scale of Beings which comes within our
Knowledge.<br>
<br>
There are some living Creatures which are raised but just above dead
Matter. To mention only that Species of Shell-fish, which are form'd in
the Fashion of a Cone, that grow to the Surface of several Rocks, and
immediately die upon their being sever'd from the Place where they grow.
There are many other Creatures but one Remove from these, which have no
other Sense besides that of Feeling and Taste. Others have still an
additional one of Hearing; others of Smell, and others of Sight. It is
wonderful to observe, by what a gradual Progress the World of Life
advances through a prodigious Variety of Species, before a Creature is
form'd that is compleat in all its Senses; and even among these there is
such a different Degree of Perfection in the Sense which one Animal
enjoys beyond what appears in another, that though the Sense in
different Animals be distinguished by the same common Denomination, it
seems almost of a different Nature. If after this we look into the
several inward Perfections of Cunning and Sagacity, or what we generally
call Instinct, we find them rising after the same Manner, imperceptibly
one above another, and receiving additional Improvements, according to
the Species in which they are implanted. This Progress in Nature is so
very gradual, that the most perfect of an inferior Species comes very
near to the most imperfect of that which is immediately above it.<br>
<br>
The exuberant and overflowing Goodness of the Supreme Being, whose Mercy
extends to all his Works, is plainly seen, as I have before hinted, from
his having made so very little Matter, at least what falls within our
Knowledge, that does not swarm with Life: Nor is his Goodness less seen
in the Diversity, than in the Multitude of living Creatures. Had he only
made one Species of Animals, none of the rest would have enjoyed the
Happiness of Existence; he has, therefore, <i>specified</i> in his Creation
every degree of Life, every Capacity of Being. The whole Chasm in
Nature, from a Plant to a Man, is filled up with diverse Kinds of
Creatures, rising one over another, by such a gentle and easy Ascent,
that the little Transitions and Deviations from one Species to another,
are almost insensible. This intermediate Space is so well husbanded and
managed, that there is scarce a degree of Perception which does not
appear in some one part of the World of Life. Is the Goodness, or Wisdom
of the divine Being, more manifested in this his Proceeding?<br>
<br>
There is a Consequence, besides those I have already mentioned, which
seems very naturally deducible from the foregoing Considerations. If the
Scale of Being rises by such a regular Progress, so high as Man, we may
by a parity of Reason suppose that it still proceeds gradually through
those Beings which are of a Superior Nature to him; since there is an
infinitely greater space and room for different Degrees of Perfection,
between the Supreme Being and Man, than between Man and the most
despicable Insect. This <a name="fr5193">Consequence</a> of so great a variety of Beings
which are superior to us, from that variety which is inferior to us, is
made by Mr. <i>Lock</i>, in a Passage which I shall here set down, after
having premised, that notwithstanding there is such infinite room
between Man and his Maker for the Creative Power to exert it self in, it
is impossible that it should ever be filled up, since there will be
still an infinite Gap or Distance between the highest created Being, and
the Power which produced him.

<blockquote><i>That there should be more</i> Species <i>of intelligent Creatures above
  us, than there are of sensible and material below us, is probable to
  me from hence; That in all the visible corporeal World, we see no
  Chasms, or no Gaps. All quite down from us, the descent is by easy
  steps, and a continued Series of things, that in each remove differ
  very little one from the other. There are Fishes that have Wings, and
  are not Strangers to the airy Region: and there are some Birds, that
  are Inhabitants of the Water; whose Blood is cold as Fishes, and their
  Flesh so like in taste, that the Scrupulous are allowed them on
  Fish-days. There are Animals so near of kin both to Birds and Beasts,
  that they are in the middle between both: Amphibious Animals link the
  Terrestrial and Aquatick together; Seals live at Land and at Sea, and
  Porpoises have the warm Blood and Entrails of a Hog; not to mention
  what is confidently reported of Mermaids or Sea-Men. There are some
  Brutes, that seem to have as much Knowledge and Reason, as some that
  are called Men; and the Animal and Vegetable Kingdoms are so nearly
  join'd, that if you will take the lowest of one, and the highest of
  the other, there will scarce be perceived any great difference between
  them: and so on till we come to the lowest and the most inorganical
  parts of Matter, we shall find every where that the several Species
  are linked together, and differ but in almost insensible degrees. And
  when we consider the infinite Power and Wisdom of the Maker, we have
  reason to think that it is suitable to the magnificent Harmony of the
  Universe, and the great Design and infinite Goodness of the Architect,
  that the</i> Species <i>of Creatures should also, by gentle degrees, ascend
  upward from us towards his infinite Perfection, as we see they
  gradually descend from us downwards: Which if it be probable, we have
  reason then to be persuaded, that there are far more</i> Species <i>of
  Creatures above us, than there are beneath; we being in degrees of
  Perfection much more remote from the infinite Being of God, than we
  are from the lowest State of Being, and that which approaches nearest
  to nothing. And yet of all those distinct Species, we have no clear
  distinct</i> Ideas<a href="#f5193"><sup>3</sup></a>.</blockquote>

In this System of Being, there is no Creature so wonderful in its
Nature, and which so much deserves our particular Attention, as Man, who
fills up the middle Space between the Animal and Intellectual Nature,
the visible and invisible World, and is that Link in the Chain of
Beings, which has been often termed the <i>nexus utriusque Mundi</i>. So that
he who in one respect is associated with Angels and Arch-Angels, may
look upon a Being of infinitei Perfection as his Father, and the highest
Order of Spirits as his Brethren, <a name="fr5194">may</a> in another respect say to
<i>Corruption, thou art my Father, and to the Worm, thou art my Mother and
my Sister</i><a href="#f5194"><sup>4</sup></a>.<br>

<br>
  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'The just Value you have expressed for the Matrimonial State, is the
  Reason that I now venture to write to you, without Fear of being
  ridiculous; and confess to you, that though it is three Months since I
  lost a very agreeable Woman, who was my Wife, my Sorrow is still
  fresh; and I am often, in the midst of Company, upon any Circumstance
  that revives her Memory, with a Reflection what she would say or do on
  such an Occasion: I say, upon any Occurrence of that Nature, which I
  can give you a Sense of, though I cannot express it wholly, I am all
  over Softness, and am obliged to retire, and give Way to a few Sighs
  and Tears, before I can be easy. I cannot but recommend the Subject of
  Male Widowhood to you, and beg of you to touch upon it by the first
  Opportunity. To those who have not lived like Husbands during the
  Lives of their Spouses, this would be a tasteless Jumble of Words; but
  to such (of whom there are not a few) who have enjoyed that State with
  the Sentiments proper for it, you will have every Line, which hits the
  Sorrow, attended with a Tear of Pity and Consolation. For I know not
  by what Goodness of Providence it is, that every Gush of Passion is a
  step towards the Relief of it; and there is a certain Comfort in the
  very Act of Sorrowing, which, I suppose, arises from a secret
  Consciousness in the Mind, that the Affliction it is under flows from
  a virtuous Cause. My Concern is not indeed so outragious as at the
  first Transport; for I think it has subsided rather into a soberer
  State of Mind, than any actual Perturbation of Spirit. There might be
  Rules formed for Men's Behaviour on this great Incident, to bring them
  from that Misfortune into the Condition I am at present; which is, I
  think, that my Sorrow has converted all Roughness of Temper into
  Meekness, Good-nature, and Complacency: But indeed, when in a serious
  and lonely Hour I present my departed Consort to my Imagination, with
  that Air of Perswasion in her Countenance when I have been in Passion,
  that sweet Affability when I have been in good Humour, that tender
  Compassion when I have had any thing which gave me Uneasiness; I
  confess to you I am inconsolable, and my Eyes gush with Grief as if I
  had seen her but just then expire. In this Condition I am broken in
  upon by a charming young Woman, my Daughter, who is the Picture of
  what her Mother was on her Wedding-Day. The good Girl strives to
  comfort me; but how shall I let you know that all the Comfort she
  gives me is to make my Tears flow more easily? The Child knows she
  quickens my Sorrows, and rejoices my Heart at the same Time. Oh, ye
  Learned! tell me by what Word to speak a Motion of the Soul, for which
  there is no name. When she kneels and bids me be comforted, she is my
  Child; when I take her in my Arms, and bid her say no more, she is my
  very Wife, and is the very Comforter I lament the Loss of. I banish
  her the Room, and weep aloud that I have lost her Mother, and that I
  have her.<br>
<br>
  '<i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR, I wish it were possible for you to have a Sense of
  these pleasing Perplexities; you might communicate to the guilty part
  of Mankind, that they are incapable of the Happiness which is in the
  very Sorrows of the Virtuous.<br>
<br>
  'But pray spare me a little longer; give me Leave to tell you the
  Manner of her Death. She took leave of all her Family, and bore the
  vain Application of Medicines with the greatest Patience imaginable.
  When the Physician told her she must certainly die, she de<b>Sir</b> ed, as
  well as she could, that all who were present, except my self, might
  depart the Room. She said she had nothing to say, for she was
  resigned, and I knew all she knew that concerned us in this World; but
  she de<b>Sir</b> ed to be alone, that in the presence of God only she might,
  without Interruption, do her last Duty to me, of thanking me for all
  my Kindness to her; adding, that she hoped in my last Moments I should
  feel the same Comfort for my Goodness to her, as she did in that she
  had acquitted herself with Honour, Truth and Virtue to me.<br>
<br>
  'I curb my self, and will not tell you that this Kindness cut my Heart
  in twain, when I expected an Accusation for some passionate Starts of
  mine, in some Parts of our Time together, to say nothing, but thank me
  for the Good, if there was any Good suitable to her own Excellence!
  All that I had ever said to her, all the Circumstances of Sorrow and
  Joy between us, crowded upon my Mind in the same Instant; and when
  immediately after I saw the Pangs of Death come upon that dear Body
  which I had often embraced with Transport, when I saw those cherishing
  Eyes begin to be ghastly, and their last Struggle to be to fix
  themselves on me, how did I lose all patience? She expired in my Arms,
  and in my Distraction I thought I saw her Bosom still heave. There was
  certainly Life yet still left; I cried she just now spoke to me: But
  alas! I grew giddy, and all things moved about me from the Distemper
  of my own Head; for the best of Women was breathless, and gone for
  ever.<br>
<br>
  'Now the Doctrine I would, methinks, have you raise from this Account
  I have given you is, That there is a certain Equanimity in those who
  are good and just, which runs into their very Sorrow, and disappoints
  the Force of it. Though they must pass through Afflictions in common
  with all who are in human Nature, yet their conscious Integrity shall
  undermine their Affliction; nay, that very Affliction shall add Force
  to their Integrity, from a Reflection of the Use of Virtue in the Hour
  of Affliction. I sat down with a Design to put you upon giving us
  Rules how to overcome such Griefs as these, but I should rather advise
  you to teach Men to be capable of them.<br>
<br>
  'You Men of Letters have what you call the fine Taste in their
  Apprehensions of what is properly done or said: There is something
  like this deeply grafted in the Soul of him who is honest and faithful
  in all his Thoughts and Actions. Every thing which is false, vicious
  or unworthy, is despicable to him, though all the World should approve
  it. At the same time he has the most lively Sensibility in all
  Enjoyments and Sufferings which it is proper for him to have, where
  any Duty of Life is concerned. To want Sorrow when you in Decency and
  Truth should be afflicted, is, I should think, a greater Instance of a
  Man's being a Blockhead, than not to know the Beauty of any Passage in
  <i>Virgil</i>. You have not yet observed, <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR, that the fine
  Gentlemen of this Age set up for Hardness of Heart, and Humanity has
  very little share in their Pretences. He is a brave Fellow who is
  always ready to kill a Man he hates, but he does not stand in the same
  Degree of Esteem who laments for the Woman he loves. I should fancy
  you might work up a thousand pretty Thoughts, by reflecting upon the
  Persons most susceptible of the sort of Sorrow I have spoken of; and I
  dare say you will find upon Examination, that they are the wisest and
  the bravest of Mankind who are most capable of it.<br>

  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  I have been for many Years loud in this Assertion, That there are very
  few that can see or hear, I mean that can report what they have seen
  or heard; and this thro' Incapacity or Prejudice, one of which
  disables almost every Man who talks to you from representing things as
  he ought. For which Reason I am come to a Resolution of believing
  nothing I hear; and I contemn the Men given to Narration under the
  Appellation of a Matter of Fact Man: And according to me, a Matter of
  Fact Man is one whose Life and Conversation is spent in the Report of
  what is not Matter of Fact.<br>
<br>
  I remember when Prince <i>Eugene</i> was here, there was no knowing his
  Height or Figure, till you, <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR, gave the Publick
  Satisfaction in that Matter. In Relations, the Force of the Expression
  lies very often more in the Look, the Tone of Voice, or the Gesture,
  than the Words themselves; which being repeated in any other Manner by
  the Undiscerning, bear a very different Interpretation from their
  original Meaning. I must confess, I formerly have turn'd this Humour
  of mine to very good Account; for whenever I heard any Narration
  utter'd with extraordinary vehemence, and grounded upon considerable
  Authority, I was always ready to lay any Wager that it was not so.
  Indeed I never pretended to be so rash, as to fix the Matter in any
  particular Way in Opposition to theirs; but as there are a hundred
  Ways of any thing happening, besides that it has happen'd, I only
  controverted its falling out in that one Manner as they settled it,
  and left it to the Ninety nine other Ways, and consequently had more
  Probability of Success. I had arrived at a particular skill in warming
  a Man so far in his Narration, as to make him throw in a little of the
  Marvelous, and then, if he has much Fire, the next Degree is the
  Impossible. Now this is always the Time for fixing the Wager. But this
  requires the nicest Management, otherwise very probably the Dispute
  may arise to the old Determination by Battle. In these Conceits I have
  been very fortunate, and have won some Wagers of those who have
  professedly valued themselves upon Intelligence, and have put
  themselves to great Charge and Expence to be misinformed considerably
  sooner than the Rest of the World.<br>
<br>
  Having got a comfortable Sum by this my Opposition to publick Report,
  I have brought my self now to so great a Perfection in Inattention,
  more especially to Party Relations, that at the same time I seem with
  greedy Ears to devour up the Discourse, I certainly don't know one
  Word of it, but pursue my own Course of Thought, whether upon Business
  or Amusement, with much Tranquility: I <a name="fr5211">say</a> Inattention, because a late
  Act of Parliament has secur'd all Party-Lyars from the Penalty of a
  Wager<a href="#f5211"><sup>1</sup></a>, and consequently made it unprofitable to attend them.
  However, good Breeding obliges a Man to maintain the Figure of the
  keenest Attention, the true Posture of which in a Coffee-house I take
  to consist in leaning over a Table, with the Edge of it pressing hard
  upon your Stomach; for the more Pain the Narration is received with,
  the more gracious is your bending over: Besides that the Narrator
  thinks you forget your Pain by the Pleasure of hearing him.<br>
<br>
  Fort <i>Knock</i> has occasioned several very perplexed and inelegant Heats
  and Animosities; and there was one t'other day in a Coffee-house where
  I was, that took upon him to clear that Business to me, for he said he
  was there. I knew him to be that sort of Man that had not strength of
  Capacity to be inform'd of any thing that depended merely upon his
  being an Eye-Witness, and therefore was fully satisfied he could give
  me no Information, for the very same Reason he believed he could, for
  he was there. However, I heard him with the same Greediness as
  <i>Shakespear</i> describes in the following Lines:
<blockquote><i>I saw a Smith stand on his Hammer, thus,<br>
    With open Mouth swallowing a Taylor's News.</i></blockquote>

  I confess of late I have not been so much amazed at the Declaimers in
  Coffee-houses as I formerly was, being satisfied that they expect to
  be rewarded for their Vociferations. Of these Liars there are two
  Sorts. The Genius of the first consists in much Impudence and a strong
  Memory; the others have added to these Qualifications a good
  Understanding and smooth Language. These therefore have only certain
  Heads, which they are as eloquent upon as they can, and may be call'd
  Embellishers; the others repeat only what they hear from others as
  literally as their Parts or Zeal will permit, and are called Reciters.
  Here was a Fellow in Town some Years ago, who used to divert himself
  by telling a Lie at <i>Charing-Cross</i> in the Morning at eight of <span style="color: #663300;">the</span>
  Clock, and then following it through all Parts of the Town till eight
  at Night; at which time he came to a Club of his Friends, and diverted
  them with an Account what Censure it had at <i>Will's</i> in <i>Covent-Garden</i>, how dangerous it was believed to be at <i>Child's</i>, and what
  Inference they drew from it with Relation to Stocks at <i>Jonathan's</i>. I
  have had the Honour to travel with this Gentleman I speak of in Search
  of one of his Falshoods; and have been present when they have
  described the very Man they have spoken to, as him who first reported
  it, tall or short, black or fair, a Gentleman or a Raggamuffin,
  according as they liked the Intelligence. I have heard one of our
  ingenious Writers of News say, that when he has had a Customer come
  with an Advertisement of an Apprentice or a Wife run away, he has
  de<b>Sir</b> ed the Advertiser to compose himself a little, before he dictated
  the Description of the Offender: For when a Person is put into a
  publick Paper by a Man who is angry with him, the real Description of
  such Person is hid in the Deformity with which the angry Man described
  him; therefore this Fellow always made his Customers describe him as
  he would the Day before he offended, or else he was sure he would
  never find him out. These and many other Hints I could suggest to you
  for the Elucidation of all Fictions; but I leave it to your own
  Sagacity to improve or neglect this Speculation.<br>

I should esteem my self a very happy Man, if my Speculations could in
the least contribute to the rectifying the Conduct of my Readers in one
of the most important Affairs of Life, to wit their Choice in Marriage.
This State is the Foundation of Community, and the chief Band of
Society; and I do not think I can be too frequent on Subjects which may
give Light to my unmarried Readers, in a particular which is so
essential to their following Happiness or Misery. A virtuous
Disposition, a good Understanding, an agreeable Person, and an easy
Fortune, are the things which should be chiefly regarded on this
Occasion. Because my present View is to direct a young Lady, who, I
think, is now in doubt whom to take of many Lovers, I shall talk at this
time to my female Reader. The Advantages, as I was going to say, of
Sense, Beauty and Riches, are what are certainly the chief Motives to a
prudent young Woman of Fortune for changing her Condition; but as she is
to have her Eye upon each of these, she is to ask herself whether the
Man who has most of these Recommendations in the Lump is not the most
de<b>Sir</b> able. He that has excellent Talents, with a moderate Estate, and an
agreeable Person, is preferable to him who is only rich, if it were only
that good Faculties may purchase Riches, but Riches cannot purchase
worthy Endowments. I do not mean that Wit, and a Capacity to entertain,
is what should be highly valued, except it is founded upon Good-nature
and Humanity. There are many ingenious Men, whose Abilities do little
else but make themselves and those about them uneasy: Such are those who
are far gone in the Pleasures of the Town, who cannot support Life
without quick Sensations and gay Reflections, and are Strangers to
Tranquility, to right Reason, and a calm Motion of Spirits without
Transport or Dejection. <a name="fr5221">These</a> ingenious Men, of all Men living, are most
to be avoided by her who would be happy in <span style="color: #663300;">a</span><a href="#f5221"><sup>1</sup></a> Husband. They are
immediately sated with Possession, and must necessarily fly to new
Acquisitions of Beauty, to pass away the whiling Moments and Intervals
of Life; for with them every Hour is heavy that is not joyful. But there
is a sort of Man of Wit and Sense, that can reflect upon his own Make,
and that of his Partner, with the Eyes of Reason and Honour, and who
believes he offends against both these, if he does not look upon the
Woman (who chose him to be under his Protection in Sickness and Health)
with the utmost Gratitude, whether from that Moment she is shining or
defective in Person or Mind: I say, there are those who think themselves
bound to supply with Good-nature the Failings of those who love them,
and who always think those the Objects of Love and Pity, who came to
their Arms the Objects of Joy and Admiration.<br>
<br>
Of this latter sort is <i>Lysander</i>, a Man of Wit, Learning, Sobriety and
Good-nature, of Birth and Estate below no Woman to accept, and of whom
it might be said, should he succeed in his present Wishes, his Mistress
rais'd his Fortune, but not that she made it. When a Woman is
deliberating with herself whom she shall chuse of many near each other
in other Pretensions, certainly he of best Understanding is to be
preferr'd. Life hangs heavily in the repeated Conversation of one who
has no Imagination to be fired at the several Occasions and Objects
which come before him, or who cannot Strike out of his Reflections new
Paths of pleasing Discourse. Honest <i>Will Thrash</i> and his Wife, tho' not
married above four Months, have scarce had a Word to say to each other
this six weeks; and one cannot form to one's self a sillier Picture,
than these two Creatures in solemn Pomp and Plenty unable to enjoy their
Fortunes, and at a full stop among a Crowd of Servants, to whose Taste
of Life they are beholden for the little Satisfactions by which they can
be understood to be so much as barely in Being. The Hours of the Day,
the Distinctions of Noon and Night, Dinner and Supper, are the greatest
Notices they are capable of. This is perhaps representing the Life of a
very modest Woman, joined to a dull Fellow, more insipid than it really
deserves; but I am sure it is not to exalt the Commerce with an
ingenious Companion too high, to say that every new Accident or Object
which comes into such a Gentleman's way, gives his Wife new Pleasures
and Satisfactions. The Approbation of his Words and Actions is a
continual new Feast to her, nor can she enough applaud her good Fortune
in having her Life varied every hour, her Mind more improv'd, and her
Heart more glad from every Circumstance which they meet with. He will
lay out his Invention in forming new Pleasures and Amusements, and make
the Fortune she has brought him subservient to the Honour and Reputation
of her and hers. A Man of Sense who is thus oblig'd, is ever contriving
the Happiness of her who did him so great a Distinction; while the Fool
is ungrateful without Vice, and never returns a Favour because he is not
sensible of it. I would, methinks, have so much to say for my self, that
if I fell into the hands of him who treated me ill, he should be
sensible when he did so: His Conscience should be of my side, whatever
became of his Inclination. I do not know but it is the insipid Choice
which has been made by those who have the Care of young Women, that the
Marriage State it self has been liable to so much Ridicule. But a
well-chosen Love, mov'd by Passion on both sides, and perfected by the
Generosity of one Party, must be adorn'd with so many handsome Incidents
on the other side, that every particular Couple would be an example in
many Circumstances to all the rest of the Species. I shall end the Chat
upon this Subject with a couple of Letters, one from a Lover who is very
well acquainted with the way of Bargaining on these Occasions; and the
other from his Rival, who has a less Estate, but great Gallantry of
Temper. As for my Man of Prudence, he makes love, as he says, as if he
were already a Father, and laying aside the Passion, comes to the Reason
of the Thing.<br>

<br>

I am always highly delighted with the discovery of any rising Genius
among my Countrymen. For <a name="fr5231">this</a> reason I have read over, with great
pleasure, the late Miscellany published by Mr. <i>Pope</i><a href="#f5231"><sup>1</sup></a>, in which
there are many excellent Compositions of that ingenious Gentleman. I
have had a pleasure of the same kind, in perusing a Poem that is just
publish'd <i>on the Prospect of Peace</i>, and which, I hope, will meet with
such a Reward from its Patrons, as so noble a Performance deserves. I
was particularly <a name="fr5232">well</a> pleased to find that the Author had not amused
himself with Fables out of the Pagan Theology, and that when he hints at
any thing of <span style="color: #663300;">this</span><a href="#f5232"><sup>2</sup></a> nature, he alludes to it only as to a Fable.<br>
<br>
Many of our Modern Authors, whose Learning very often extends no farther
than <i>Ovid's Metamorphosis</i>, do not know how to celebrate a Great Man,
without mixing a parcel of School-Boy Tales with the Recital of his
Actions. If you read a Poem on a fine Woman, among the Authors of this
Class, you shall see that it turns more upon <i>Venus</i> or <i>Helen</i>, that on
the Party concerned. I have known a Copy of Verses on a great Hero
highly commended; but upon asking to hear some of the beautiful
Passages, the Admirer of it has repeated to me a Speech of <i>Apollo</i>, or
a Description of <i>Polypheme</i>. At other times when I have search'd for
the Actions of a great Man, who gave a Subject to the Writer, I have
been entertained with the Exploits of a River-God, or have been forced
to attend a Fury in her mischievous Progress, from one end of the Poem
to the other. When we are at School it is necessary for us to be
acquainted with the System of Pagan Theology, and may be allowed to
enliven a Theme, or point an Epigram with an Heathen God; but when we
would write a manly Panegyrick, that should carry in it all the Colours
of Truth, nothing can be more ridiculous than to have recourse to our
<i>Jupiters</i> and <i>Junos</i>.<br>
<br>
No Thought is beautiful which is not just, and no Thought can be just
which is not founded in Truth, or at least in that which passes for
such.<br>
<br>
In Mock-Heroick Poems, the Use of the Heathen Mythology is not only
excusable but graceful, because it is the Design of such Compositions to
divert, by adapting the fabulous Machines of the Ancients to low
Subjects, and at the same time by ridiculing such kinds of Machinery in
modern Writers. If any are of opinion, that there is a Necessity of
admitting these Classical Legends into our serious Compositions, in
order to give them a more Poetical Turn; I would recommend to their
Consideration the Pastorals of Mr. <i>Philips</i>. One would have thought it
impossible for this Kind of Poetry to have subsisted without Fawns and
Satyrs, Wood Nymphs, and Water Nymphs, with all the Tribe of rural
Deities. But we see he has given a new Life, and a more natural Beauty
to this way of Writing by substituting in the place of these Antiquated
Fables, the superstitious Mythology which prevails among the Shepherds
of our own Country.<br>
<br>
<i>Virgil</i> and <i>Homer</i> might compliment their Heroes, by interweaving the
Actions of Deities with their Atchievements; but for a Christian Author
to write in the Pagan Creed, to make Prince <i>Eugene</i> a Favourite of
<i>Mars</i>, or to carry on a Correspondence between <i>Bellona</i> and the
Marshal <i>de Villars</i>, would be downright Puerility, and unpardonable in
a Poet that is past Sixteen. It is want of sufficient Elevation in a
Genius to describe Realities, and place them in a shining Light, that
makes him have recourse to such trifling antiquated Fables; as a Man may
write a fine Description of <i>Bacchus</i> or <i>Apollo</i>, that does not know
how to draw the Character of any of his Contemporaries.<br>
<br>
In order therefore to put a stop to this absurd Practice, I shall
publish the following Edict, by virtue of that Spectatorial Authority
with which I stand invested.<br>
<br>
'Whereas the Time of a General Peace is, in all appearance, drawing
near, being inform'd that there are several ingenious Persons who intend
to shew their Talents on so happy an Occasion, and being willing, as
much as in me lies, to prevent that Effusion of Nonsense, which we have
good Cause to apprehend; I do hereby strictly require every Person, who
shall write on this Subject, to remember that he is a Christian, and not
to Sacrifice his Catechism to his Poetry. In order to it, I do expect of
him in the first place, to make his own Poem, without depending upon
<i>Ph&oelig;bus</i> for any part of it, or calling out for Aid upon any one of the
Muses by Name. I do likewise positively forbid the sending of <i>Mercury</i>
with any particular Message or Dispatch relating to the Peace, and shall
by no means suffer <i>Minerva</i> to take upon her the Shape of any
Plenipotentiary concerned in this Great Work. I do further declare, that
I shall not allow the Destinies to have had an hand in the Deaths of the
several thousands who have been slain in the late War, being of opinion
that all such Deaths may be very well accounted for by the Christian
System of Powder and Ball. I do therefore strictly forbid the Fates to
cut the Thread of Man's Life upon any pretence whatsoever, unless it be
for the sake of the Rhyme. And whereas I have good Reason to fear, that
<i>Neptune</i> will have a great deal of Business on his Hands, in several
Poems which we may now suppose are upon the Anvil, I do also prohibit
his Appearance, unless it be done in Metaphor, Simile, or any very short
Allusion, and that even here he be not permitted to enter, but with
great Caution and Circumspection. I de<b>Sir</b> e that the same Rule may be
extended to his whole Fraternity of Heathen Gods, it being my design to
condemn every Poem to the Flames in which <i>Jupiter</i> Thunders, or
exercises any other Act of Authority which does not belong to him: In
short, I expect that no Pagan Agent shall be introduc'd, or any Fact
related which a Man cannot give Credit to with a good Conscience.
Provided always, that nothing herein contained shall extend, or be
construed to extend, to several of the Female Poets in this Nation, who
shall be still left in full Possession of their Gods and Goddesses, in
the same manner as if this Paper had never been written.<br>

When I first of all took it in my Head to write Dreams and Visions, I
determin'd to Print nothing of that nature, which was not of my own
Invention. But several laborious Dreamers have of late communicated to
me Works of this Nature, which, for their Reputations and my own, I have
hitherto suppressed. Had I printed every one that came to my Hands, my
Book of Speculations would have been little else but a Book of Visions.
Some of my Correspondents have indeed been so very modest, as to offer
at an Excuse for their not being in a Capacity to dream better. I have
by me, for example, the Dream of a young Gentleman not past Fifteen. I
have likewise by me the Dream of a Person of Quality, and another called
the Lady's Dream. In these, and other Pieces of the same nature, it is
suppos'd the usual Allowances will be made to the Age, Condition and Sex
of the Dreamer. To prevent this Inundation of Dreams, which daily flows
in upon me, I shall apply to all Dreamers of Dreams, the Advice which
<i>Epictetus</i> has couched, after his manner, in a very simple and concise
Precept. 

<blockquote><i>Never tell thy Dreams</i>, says that Philosopher, <i>for tho' thou
thy self may'st take a Pleasure in telling thy Dream, another will take
no Pleasure in hearing it</i>. </blockquote>

After this short Preface, I must do Justice
to two or three Visions which I have lately publish'd, and which I have
owned to have been written by other Hands. I shall add a Dream to these,
which comes to me from <i>Scotland</i>, by one who declares himself of that
Country, and for all I know may be second-sighted. There is, indeed,
something in it of the Spirit of <i>John Bunyan</i>; but at the same time a
certain Sublime, which that Author was never master of. I shall publish
it, because I question not but it will fall in with the Taste of all my
popular Readers, and amuse the Imaginations of those who are more
profound; declaring at the same time, that this is the last Dream which
I intend to publish this Season.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote> <i><b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  'I was last <i>Sunday</i> in the Evening led into a serious Reflection on
  the Reasonableness of Virtue, and great Folly of Vice, from an
  excellent Sermon I had heard that Afternoon in my Parish-Church. Among
  other Observations, the Preacher shew'd us that the Temptations which
  the Tempter propos'd, were all on a Supposition, that we are either
  Madmen or Fools, or with an Intention to render us such; that in no
  other Affair we would suffer ourselves to be thus imposed upon, in a
  Case so plainly and clearly against our visible Interest. His
  illustrations and Arguments carried so much Persuasion and Conviction
  with them, that they remained a considerable while fresh, and working
  in my Memory; till at last the Mind, fatigued with Thought, gave way
  to the forcible Oppressions of Slumber and Sleep, whilst Fancy,
  unwilling yet to drop the Subject, presented me with the following
  Vision.<br>
<br>
  'Methought I was just awoke out of a Sleep, that I could never
  remember the beginning of; the Place where I found my self to be, was
  a wide and spacious Plain, full of People that wandered up and down
  through several beaten Paths, whereof some few were strait, and in
  direct lines, but most of them winding and turning like a Labyrinth;
  but yet it appear'd to me afterwards, that these last all met in one
  Issue, so that many that seemed to steer quite contrary Courses, did
  at length meet and face one another, to the no little Amazement of
  many of them.<br>
<br>
  'In the midst of the Plain there was a great Fountain: They called it
  the Spring of <i>Self-Love</i>; out of it issued two Rivulets to the
  Eastward and Westward, the Name of the first was <i>Heavenly-Wisdom</i>,
  its Water was wonderfully clear, but of a yet more wonderful Effect;
  the other's Name was <i>Worldly-Wisdom</i>, its Water was thick, and yet
  far from dormant or stagnating, for it was in a continual violent
  Agitation; which kept the Travellers whom I shall mention by and by,
  from being sensible of the Foulness and Thickness of the Water; which
  had this Effect, that it intoxicated those who drunk it, and made 'em
  mistake every Object that lay before them: both Rivulets were parted
  near their Springs into so many others, as there were strait and
  crooked Paths, which they attended all along to their respective
  Issues.<br>
<br>
  'I observ'd from the several Paths many now and then diverting, to
  refresh and otherwise qualify themselves for their Journey, to the
  respective Rivulets that ran near them; they contracted a very
  observable Courage and Steadiness in what they were about, by drinking
  these Waters. At the end of the Perspective of every strait Path, all
  which did end in one Issue and Point, appeared a high Pillar, all of
  Diamond, casting Rays as bright as those of the Sun into the Paths;
  which Rays had also certain sympathizing and alluring Virtues in them,
  so that whosoever had made some considerable progress in his Journey
  onwards towards the Pillar, by the repeated impression of these Rays
  upon him, was wrought into an habitual Inclination and Conversion of
  his Sight towards it, so that it grew at last in a matter natural to
  him to look and gaze upon it, whereby he was kept steddy in the strait
  Paths, which alone led to that radiant Body, the beholding of which
  was now grown a Gratification to his Nature.<br>
<br>
  'At the Issue of the crooked Paths there was a great black Tower, out
  of the Centre of which streamed a long Succession of Flames, which did
  rise even above the Clouds; it gave a very great Light to the whole
  Plain, which did sometimes outshine the Light, and opprest the Beams
  of the Adamantine Pillar; tho' by the Observation I made afterwards,
  it appeared that it was not for any Diminution of Light, but that this
  lay in the Travellers, who would sometimes step out of the strait
  Paths, where they lost the full Prospect of the Radiant Pillar, and
  saw it but side-ways: but the great Light from the black Tower, which
  was somewhat particularly scorching to them, would generally light and
  hasten them to their proper Climate again.<br>
<br>
  'Round about the black Tower there were, methoughts, many thousands of
  huge mis-shapen ugly Monsters; these had great Nets, which they were
  perpetually plying and casting towards the crooked Paths, and they
  would now and then catch up those that were nearest to them: these
  they took up streight, and whirled over the Walls into the flaming
  Tower, and they were no more seen nor heard of.<br>
<br>
  'They would sometimes cast their Nets towards the right Paths to catch
  the Stragglers, whose Eyes for want of frequent drinking at the Brook
  that ran by them grew dim, whereby they lost their way; these would
  sometimes very narrowly miss being catched away, but I could not hear
  whether any of these had ever been so unfortunate, that had been
  before very hearty in the strait Paths.<br>
<br>
  'I considered all these strange Sights with great Attention, till at
  last I was interrupted by a Cluster of the Travellers in the crooked
  Paths, who came up to me, bid me go along with them, and presently
  fell to singing and dancing; they took me by the Hand, and so carried
  me away along with them. After I had follow'd them a considerable
  while, I perceiv'd I had lost the black Tower of Light, at which I
  greatly wonder'd; but as I looked and gazed round about me, and saw
  nothing, I begun to fancy my first Vision had been but a Dream, and
  there was no such thing in reality: but then I consider'd, that if I
  could fancy to see what was not, I might as well have an Illusion
  wrought on me at present, and not see what was really before me. I was
  very much confirmed in this Thought, by the Effect I then just
  observ'd the Water of <i>Worldly-Wisdom</i> had upon me; for as I had drunk
  a little of it again, I felt a very sensible Effect in my Head;
  methought it distracted and disorder'd all there: this made me stop of
  a sudden, suspecting some Charm or Inchantment. As I was casting about
  within my self what I should do, and whom to apply to in this Case; I
  spy'd at some distance off me a Man beckning, and making signs to me
  to come over to him. I cry'd to him, <i>I did not know the Way</i>. He then
  called to me audibly, to step at least out of the Path I was in; for
  if I staid there any longer I was in danger to be catched in a great
  Net that was just hanging over me, and ready to catch me up; that he
  wonder'd I was so blind, or so distracted, as not to see so imminent
  and visible a Danger; assuring me, that as soon as I was out of that
  Way, he would come to me to lead me into a more secure Path. This I
  did, and he brought me his Palm full of the Water of
  <i>Heavenly-Wisdom</i>, which was of very great use to me, for my Eyes were
  streight cleared, and I saw the great black Tower just before me; but
  the great Net which I spy'd so near me, cast me in such a Terror, that
  I ran back as far as I could in one Breath, without looking behind me:
  then my Benefactor thus bespoke me, You have made the wonderful'st
  Escape in the World, the Water you used to drink is of a bewitching
  Nature, you would else have been mightily shocked at the Deformities
  and Meanness of the Place; for beside the Set of blind Fools, in whose
  Company you was, you may now observe many others who are only
  bewitched after another no less dangerous manner. Look a little that
  way, there goes a Crowd of Passengers, they have indeed so good a
  Head, as not to suffer themselves to be blinded by this bewitching
  Water; the black Tower is not vanished out of their sight, they see it
  whenever they look up to it; but see how they go side-ways, and with
  their Eyes downwards, as if they were mad, that they may thus rush
  into the Net, without being beforehand troubled at the Thought of so
  miserable a Destruction. Their Wills are so perverse, and their Hearts
  so fond of the Pleasures of the Place, that rather than forgo them
  they will run all Hazards, and venture upon all the Miseries and Woes
  before them.<br>
<br>
  'See there that other Company, tho' they should drink none of the
  bewitching Water, yet they take a Course bewitching and deluding; see
  how they chuse the crookedest Paths, whereby they have often the black
  Tower behind them, and sometimes see the radiant Column side-ways,
  which gives them some weak Glimpse of it. These Fools content
  themselves with that, not knowing whether any other have any more of
  its Influence and Light than themselves: this Road is called that of
  <i>Superstition</i> or <i>Human Invention</i>; they grossly over-look that which
  the Rules and Laws of the Place prescribe to them, and contrive some
  other Scheme and Set of Directions and Prescriptions for themselves,
  which they hope will serve their turn. He shewed me many other kind of
  Fools, which put me quite out of humour with the Place. At last he
  carried me to the right Paths, where I found true and solid Pleasure,
  which entertained me all the way, till we came in closer sight of the
  Pillar, where the Satisfaction increased to that measure that my
  Faculties were not able to contain it; in the straining of them I was
  violently waked, not a little grieved at the vanishing of so pleasing
  a Dream.<br>

It is my Custom to take <span style="color: #663300;">frequent</span> Opportunities of enquiring from time
to time, what Success my Speculations meet with in the Town. I am glad
to find in particular, that my Discourses on Marriage have been well
received. A Friend of mine gives me to understand, from
<i>Doctors-Commons</i>, that more Licences have been taken out there of late
than usual. I am likewise informed of several pretty Fellows, who have
resolved to commence Heads of Families by the first favourable
Opportunity: One of them writes me word, that he is ready to enter into
the Bonds of Matrimony, provided I will give it him under my Hand (as I
now do) that a Man may shew his Face in good Company after he is
married, and that he need not be ashamed to treat a Woman with Kindness,
who puts herself into his Power for Life.<br>
<br>
I have other Letters on this Subject, which say that I am attempting to
make a Revolution in the World of Gallantry, and that the Consequence of
it will be, that a great deal of the sprightliest Wit and Satyr of the
last Age will be lost. That a bashful Fellow, upon changing his
Condition, will be no longer puzzled how to stand the Raillery of his
facetious Companions; <a name="fr5251">that</a> he need not own he married only to plunder an
Heiress of her Fortune, nor pretend that he uses her ill, to avoid the
<span style="color: #663300;">ridiculous</span><a href="#f5251"><sup>1</sup></a> Name of a fond Husband.<br>
<br>
Indeed if I may speak my Opinion of great part of the Writings which
once prevail'd among us under the Notion of Humour, they are such as
would tempt one to think there had been an Association among the Wits of
those times to rally Legitimacy out of our Island. A State of Wedlock
was the common Mark for all the Adventurers in Farce and Comedy, as well
as the Essayers in Lampoon and Satyr, to shoot at, and nothing was a
more standing Jest in all Clubs of fashionable Mirth, and gay
Conversation. It was determined among those airy Criticks, that the
Appellation of a <i>Sober Man</i> should signify a <i>Spiritless Fellow</i>. And I
am apt to think it was about the same Time, that <i>Good-Nature</i>, a Word
so peculiarly elegant in our Language that some have affirmed it cannot
well be expressed in any other, came first to be render'd suspicious,
and in danger of being transferred from its original Sense to so distant
an Idea as that of <i>Folly</i>.<br>
<br>
I must confess it has been my Ambition, in the course of my Writings, to
restore, as well as I was able, the proper Ideas of things. And as I
have attempted this already on the Subject of Marriage, in several
Papers, I shall here add some further Observations which occur to me on
the same Head. Nothing seems to be thought, by our fine Gentlemen, so
indispensable an Ornament in fashionable Life, as Love. <i>A Knight
Errant</i>, says <i>Don Quixot, without a Mistress, is like a Tree without
Leaves</i> and a Man of Mode among us, who has not some Fair One to sigh
for, might as well pretend to appear dressed, without his Periwig. We
have Lovers in Prose innumerable. All our Pretenders to Rhyme are
professed Inamorato's; and there is scarce a Poet, good or bad, to be
heard of, who has not some real or supposed <i>Sacharissa</i> to improve his
Vein.<br>
<br>
If Love be any Refinement, <i>Conjugal Love</i> must be certainly so in a
much higher Degree. There is no comparison between the frivolous
Affectation of attracting the Eyes of Women with whom you are only
captivated by Way of Amusement, and of whom perhaps you know nothing
more than their Features, and a regular and uniform Endeavour to make
your self valuable, both as a Friend and Lover, to one whom you have
chosen to be the Companion of your Life. The first is the Spring of a
thousand Fopperies, silly Artifices, Falshoods, and perhaps Barbarities;
or at best arises no higher than to a kind of Dancing-School Breeding,
to give the Person a more sparkling Air. The latter is the Parent of
substantial Virtues and agreeable Qualities, and cultivates the Mind
while it improves the Behaviour. The Passion of Love to a Mistress, even
where it is most sincere, resembles too much the Flame of a Fever; that
to a Wife is like the Vital Heat.<br>
<br>
I have often thought, if the Letters written by Men of Goodnature to
their Wives, were to be compared with those written by Men of Gallantry
to their Mistresses, the former, notwithstanding any Inequality of
Style, would appear to have the Advantage. Friendship, Tenderness and
Constancy, drest in a Simplicity of Expression, recommend themselves by
a more native Elegance, than passionate Raptures, extravagant Encomiums,
and slavish Adoration. If we were admitted to search the Cabinet of the
beautiful <i>Narcissa</i>, among Heaps of Epistles from several Admirers,
which are there preserv'd with equal Care, how few should we find but
would make any one Sick in the Reading, except her who is flattered by
them? But in how different a Style must the wise <i>Benevolus</i>, who
converses with that good Sense and good Humour among all his Friends,
write to a Wife who is the worthy Object of his utmost Affection?
<i>Benevolus</i>, both in Publick and Private, on all Occasions of Life,
appears to have every good Quality and de<b>Sir</b> able Ornament. Abroad he is
reverenced and esteemed; at home beloved and happy. The Satisfaction he
enjoys there, settles into an habitual Complacency, which shines in his
Countenance, enlivens his Wit, and seasons his Conversation: Even those
of his Acquaintance, who have never seen him in his Retirement, are
Sharers in the Happiness of it; and it is very much owing to his being
the best and best beloved of Husbands, that he is the most stedfast of
Friends, and the most agreeable of Companions.<br>
<br>
There is a sensible Pleasure in contemplating such beautiful Instances
of Domestick Life. The Happiness of the Conjugal State appears
heighten'd to the highest degree it is capable of, when we see two
Persons of accomplished Minds, not only united in the same Interests and
Affections, but in their Taste of the same Improvements, Pleasures and
Diversions. <i>Pliny</i>, one of the finest Gentlemen, and politest Writers
of the Age in which he lived, has left us, in his Letter to <i>Hispulla</i>,
his Wife's Aunt, one of the most agreeable Family-Pieces of this Kind I
have ever met with. I <a name="fr5252">shall</a> end this Discourse with a Translation of it;
and I believe the Reader will be of my opinion, that <i>Conjugal Love</i> is
drawn in it with a Delicacy which makes it appear to be, as I have
represented it, an Ornament as well as a Virtue.

 <blockquote> <b>Pliny</b> <i>to</i> <b>Hispulla</b><a href="#f5252"><sup>2</sup></a>.<br>
<br>
  'As I remember the great Affection which was between you and your
  excellent Brother, and know you love his Daughter as your own, so as
  not only to express the Tenderness of the best of Aunts, but even to
  supply that of the best of Fathers; I am sure it will be a pleasure to
  you to hear that she proves worthy of her Father, worthy of you, and
  of your Ancestors. Her Ingenuity is admirable; her Frugality
  extraordinary. She loves me, the surest Pledge of her Virtue; and adds
  to this a wonderful Disposition to Learning, which she has acquir'd
  from her Affection to me. She reads my Writings, studies them, and
  even gets them by heart. You'd smile to see the Concern she is in when
  I have a Cause to plead, and the Joy she shews when it is over. She
  finds means to have the first News brought her of the Success I meet
  with in Court, how I am heard, and what Decree is made. If I recite
  any thing in publick, she cannot refrain from placing her self
  privately in some Corner to hear, where with the utmost delight she
  feasts upon my Applauses. Sometimes she sings my Verses, and
  accompanies them with the Lute, without any Master, except Love, the
  best of Instructors. From these Instances I take the most certain
  Omens of our perpetual and encreasing Happiness; since our Affection
  is not founded on my Youth and Person, which must gradually decay, but
  she is in love with the immortal Part of me, my Glory and Reputation.
  Nor indeed could less be expected from one who had the Happiness to
  receive her Education from you, who in your House was accustomed to
  every thing that was virtuous and decent, and even began to love me by
  your Recommendation. For, as you had always the greatest Respect for
  my Mother, you were pleased from my Infancy to form me, to commend me,
  and kindly to presage I should be one day what my Wife fancies I am.
  Accept therefore our united Thanks; mine, that you have bestowed her
  on me, and hers, that you have given me to her, as a mutual Grant of
  Joy and Felicity.'</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>  <i>To the</i> SPECTATOR-GENERAL <i>of</i> Great Britain.<br>
<br>
  'I grant it does look a little familiar, but I must call you<br>
<br>
  <i>Dear Dumb</i>,<br>
<br>
  'Being got again to the farther End of the <i>Widow's</i> Coffeehouse, I
  shall from hence give you some account of the Behaviour of our
  Hackney-Coachmen since my last. These indefatigable Gentlemen, without
  the least Design, I dare say, of Self-Interest or Advantage to
  themselves, do still ply as Volunteers Day and Night for the Good of
  their Country. I will not trouble you with enumerating many
  Particulars, but I must by no means omit to inform you of an Infant
  about six foot high, and between twenty and thirty Years of Age, who
  was seen in the Arms of a Hackney Coach-man driving by <i>Will's</i>
  Coffee-house in <i>Covent-Garden</i>, between the Hours of four and five in
  the Afternoon of that very Day, wherein you publish'd a Memorial
  against them. This impudent young Cur, tho' he could not sit in a
  Coach-box without holding, yet would he venture his Neck to bid
  defiance to your Spectatorial Authority, or to any thing that you
  countenanced. Who he was I know not, but I heard this Relation this
  Morning from a Gentleman who was an Eye-Witness of this his Impudence;
  and I was willing to take the first opportunity to inform you of him,
  as holding it extremely requisite that you should nip him in the Bud.
  But I am my self most concerned for my Fellow-Templers,
  Fellow-Students, and Fellow-Labourers in the Law, I mean such of them
  as are dignified and distinguish'd under the Denomination of
  Hackney-Coachmen. Such aspiring Minds have these ambitious young Men,
  that they cannot enjoy themselves out of a Coach-Box. It is however an
  unspeakable Comfort to me, that I can now tell you, that some of them
  are grown so bashful as to study only in the Nighttime, or in the
  Country. The other Night I spied one of our young Gentlemen very
  diligent at his Lucubrations in <i>Fleet-Street</i>; and by the way, I
  should be under some concern, lest this hard Student should one time
  or other crack his Brain with studying, but that I am in hopes Nature
  has taken care to fortify him in proportion to the great Undertakings
  he was design'd for. Another of my Fellow-Templers, on <i>Thursday</i>
  last, was getting up into his Study at the Bottom of <i>Grays-Inn-Lane</i>,
  in order, I suppose, to contemplate in the fresh Air. Now, <b>Sir</b> , my
  Request is, that the great Modesty of these two Gentlemen may be
  recorded as a Pattern to the rest; and if you would but give them two
  or three Touches with your own Pen, tho' you might not perhaps prevail
  with them to desist entirely from their Meditations, yet I doubt not
  but you would at least preserve them from being publick Spectacles of
  Folly in our Streets. I say, two or three Touches with your own Pen;
  for I have really observed, Mr. <b>Spec</b>, that those <i><b>Spectators</b></i> which
  are so prettily laced down the sides with little c's, how instructive
  soever they may be, do not carry with them that Authority as the
  others. I do again therefore de<b>Sir</b> e, that for the sake of their dear
  Necks, you will bestow one Penful of your own Ink upon them. I know
  you are loth to expose them; and it is, I must confess, a thousand
  Pities that any young Gentleman, who is come of honest Parents, should
  be brought to publick Shame: And indeed I should be glad to have them
  handled a little tenderly at the first; but if fair means will not
  prevail, there is then no other Way to reclaim them, but by making use
  of some wholesome Severities; and I think it is better that a Dozen or
  two of such good-for-nothing Fellows should be made Examples of, than
  that the Reputation of some Hundreds of as hopeful young Gentlemen as
  my self should suffer thro' their Folly. It is not, however, for me to
  direct you what to do; but, in short, if our Coachmen will drive on
  this Trade, the very first of them that I do find meditating in the
  Street, I shall make Bold to take the Number of his Chambers, together
  with a Note of his Name, and dispatch them to you, that you may
  chastise him at your own Discretion.<br>

Esq., if you please.<br>

<blockquote>  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'Tis now almost three months since I was in Town about some Business;
  and the Hurry of it being over, took Coach one Afternoon, and drove to
  see a Relation, who married about six Years ago a wealthy Citizen. I
  found her at home, but her Husband gone to the <i>Exchange</i>, and
  expected back within an Hour at the farthest. After the usual
  Salutations of Kindness, and a hundred Questions about Friends in the
  Country, we sat down to Piquet, played two or three Games, and drank
  Tea. I should have told you that this was my second time of seeing her
  since Marriage, but before she lived at the same Town where I went to
  School; so that the Plea of a Relation, added to the Innocence of my
  Youth, prevailed upon her good Humour to indulge me in a Freedom of
  Conversation as often, and oftner, than the strict Discipline of the
  School would allow of. You may easily imagine after such an
  Acquaintance we might be exceeding merry without any Offence, as in
  calling to mind how many Inventions I had been put to in deluding the
  Master, how many Hands forged for Excuses, how many times been sick in
  perfect Health; for I was then never sick but at School, and only then
  because out of her Company. We had whiled away three Hours after this
  manner, when I found it past Five; and not expecting her Husband would
  return till late, rose up, told her I should go early next Morning for
  the Country: She kindly answered she was afraid it would be long
  before she saw me again; so I took my leave and parted. Now, <b>Sir</b> , I
  had not been got home a Fortnight, when I received a Letter from a
  Neighbour of theirs, that ever since that fatal Afternoon the Lady had
  been most inhumanly treated, and the Husband publickly stormed that he
  was made a Member of too numerous a Society. He had, it seems,
  listened most of the time my Cousin and I were together. As jealous
  Ears always hear double, so he heard enough to make him mad; and as
  jealous Eyes always see thro' Magnifying Glasses, so he was certain it
  could not be I whom he had seen, a beardless Stripling, but fancied he
  saw a gay Gentleman of the <i>Temple</i>, ten Years older than my self; and
  for that reason, I presume, durst not come in, nor take any Notice
  when I went out. He is perpetually asking his Wife if she does not
  think the time long (as she said she should) till she see her Cousin
  again. Pray, <b>Sir</b> , what can be done in this Case? I have writ to him to
  assure him I was at his House all that afternoon expecting to see him:
  His Answer is, 'tis only a Trick of hers, and that he neither can nor
  will believe me. The parting Kiss I find mightily nettles him, and
  confirms him in all his Errors. <i>Ben. Johnson</i>, as I remember, makes a
  Foreigner in one of his Comedies, <i>admire the desperate Valour of the
  bold</i> English, <i>who let out their Wives to all Encounters</i>. The
  general Custom of Salutation should Excuse the Favour done me, or you
  should lay down Rules when such Distinctions are to be given or
  omitted. You cannot imagine, <b>Sir</b> , how troubled I am for this unhappy
  Lady's Misfortune; and beg you would insert this Letter, that the
  Husband may reflect upon this Accident coolly. It is no small Matter,
  the Ease of a virtuous Woman for her whole Life: I know she will
  conform to any Regularities (tho' more strict than the common Rules of
  our Country require) to which his particular Temper shall incline him
  to oblige her. This Accident puts me in mind how generously
  <i>Pisistratus</i> the <i>Athenian</i> Tyrant behaved himself on a like
  Occasion, when he was instigated by his Wife to put to death a young
  Gentleman, because being passionately fond of his Daughter, he kissed
  her in publick as he met her in the Street; <i>What</i> (says he) <i>shall we
  do to those who are our Enemies, if we do thus to those who are our
  Friends?</i> I will not trouble you much longer, but am exceedingly
  concern'd lest this Accident may cause a virtuous Lady to lead a
  miserable Life with a Husband, who has no Grounds for his Jealousy but
  what I have faithfully related, and ought to be reckon'd none. 'Tis to
  be fear'd too, if at last he sees his Mistake, yet People will be as
  slow and unwilling in disbelieving Scandal as they are quick and
  forward in believing it. I shall endeavour to enliven this plain
  honest Letter, with <i>Ovid's</i> Relation about <i>Cybele's</i> Image. The Ship
  wherein it was aboard was stranded at the mouth of the <i>Tyber</i>, and
  the Men were unable to move it, till <i>Claudia</i>, a Virgin, but
  suspected of Unchastity, by a slight Pull hawled it in. The Story is
  told in the fourth Book of the <i>Fasti</i>.

<blockquote><i>Parent of Gods, began the weeping Fair,<br>
Reward or punish, but oh! hear my Pray'r.<br>
If Lewdness e'er defil'd my Virgin Bloom,<br>
From Heav'n with Justice I receive my Doom;<br>
But if my Honour yet has known no Stain,<br>
Thou, Goddess, thou my Innocence maintain;<br>
Thou, whom the nicest Rules of Goodness sway'd,<br>
Vouchsafe to follow an unblemish'd Maid.<br>
She spoke, and touch'd the Cord with glad Surprize,<br>
(The truth was witness'd by ten thousand Eyes)<br>

Follow'd in triumph, and adorn'd her Guide;<br>

  'You will oblige a languishing Lover, if you will please to print the
  enclosed Verses in your next Paper. If you remember the
  <i>Metamorphosis</i>, you know <i>Procris</i>, the fond Wife of <i>Cephalus</i>, is
  said to have made her Husband, who delighted in the Sports of the
  Wood, a Present of an unerring Javelin. In process of time he was so
  much in the Forest, that his Lady suspected he was pursuing some
  Nymph, under the pretence of following a Chace more innocent. Under
  this Suspicion she hid herself among the Trees, to observe his
  Motions. While she lay conceal'd, her Husband, tired with the Labour
  of Hunting, came within her hearing. As he was fainting with Heat, he
  cried out, <i>Aura veni; Oh charming Air approach</i>.<br>
<br>
  'The unfortunate Wife, taking the Word <i>Air</i> to be the name of a
  Woman, began to move among the Bushes; and the Husband believing it a
  Deer, threw his Javelin and kill'd her. This History painted on a Fan,
  which I presented to a Lady, gave occasion to my growing poetical.

<blockquote><i>Come gentle Air! th'</i> &AElig;olian <i>Shepherd said,<br>
While</i> Procris <i>panted in the secret Shade;<br>
Come gentle Air! the fairer</i> Delia <i>cries,<br>
While at her Feet her Swain expiring lies.<br>
Lo the glad Gales o'er all her Beauties stray,<br>
Breathe on her Lips, and in her Bosom play.<br>
In</i> Delia's <i>Hand this Toy is fatal found,<br>
Nor did that fabled Dart more surely wound.<br>
Both Gifts destructive to the Givers prove,<br>
Alike both Lovers fall by those they love:<br>
Yet guiltless too this bright Destroyer lives,<br>
At random wounds, nor knows the Wound she gives.<br>
She views the Story with attentive Eyes,<br>
And pities</i> Procris, <i>while her Lover dies.</i></blockquote></blockquote><br>

<br>
  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'I who now write to you, am a Woman loaded with Injuries, and the
  Aggravation of my Misfortune is, that they are such which are
  overlooked by the Generality of Mankind, and tho' the most afflicting
  imaginable, not regarded as such in the general Sense of the World. I
  have hid my Vexation from all Mankind; but have now taken Pen, Ink,
  and Paper, and am resolv'd to unbosom my self to you, and lay before
  you what grieves me and all the Sex. You have very often mentioned
  particular Hardships done to this or that Lady; but, methinks, you
  have not in any one Speculation directly pointed at the partial
  Freedom Men take, the unreasonable Confinement Women are obliged to,
  in the only Circumstance in which we are necessarily to have a
  Commerce with them, that of Love. The Case of Celibacy is the great
  Evil of our Nation; and the Indulgence of the vicious Conduct of Men
  in that State, with the Ridicule to which Women are exposed, though
  ever so virtuous, if long unmarried, is the Root of the greatest
  Irregularities of this Nation. To shew you, <b>Sir</b> , that tho' you never
  have given us the Catalogue of a Lady's Library as you promised, we
  read good Books of our own chusing, I shall insert on this occasion a
  Paragraph or two out of <i>Echard's Roman History</i>. In the 44th Page of
  the second Volume the Author observes, that <i>Augustus</i>, upon his
  Return to <i>Rome</i> at the end of a War, received Complaints that too
  great a Number of the young Men of Quality were unmarried. The Emperor
  thereupon assembled the whole <i>Equestrian</i> Order; and having separated
  the Married from the Single, did particular Honours to the former, but
  he told the latter, that is to say, Mr. SPECTATOR, he told the
  Batchelors,

<blockquote>    "That their Lives and Actions had been so peculiar, that he knew not
    by what Name to call 'em; not by that of Men, for they performed
    nothing that was manly; not by that of Citizens, for the City might
    perish notwithstanding their Care; nor by that of <i>Romans</i>, for they
    designed to extirpate the <i>Roman</i> Name." </blockquote>

  Then proceeding to shew his tender Care and hearty Affection for his
  People, he further told them,

<blockquote>    "That their Course of Life was of such pernicious Consequence to the
    Glory and Grandeur of the <i>Roman</i> Nation, that he could not chuse
    but tell them, that all other Crimes put together could not equalize
    theirs: For they were guilty of Murder, in not suffering those to be
    born which should proceed from them; of Impiety, in causing the
    Names and Honours of their Ancestors to cease; and of Sacrilege, in
    destroying their Kind, which proceeded from the immortal Gods, and
    Human Nature, the principal thing consecrated to 'em: Therefore in
    this Respect they dissolved the Government, in disobeying its Laws;
    betrayed their Country, by making it barren and waste; nay and
    demolished their City, in depriving it of Inhabitants. And he was
    sensible that all this proceeded not from any kind of Virtue or
    Abstinence, but from a Looseness and Wantonness, which ought never
    to be encouraged in any Civil Government." </blockquote>

  There are no Particulars dwelt upon that let us into the Conduct of
  these young Worthies, whom this great Emperor treated with so much
  Justice and Indignation; but any one who observes what passes in this
  Town, may very well frame to himself a Notion of their Riots and
  Debaucheries all Night, and their apparent Preparations for them all
  Day. It is not to be doubted but these <i>Romans</i> never passed any of
  their Time innocently but when they were asleep, and never slept but
  when they were weary and heavy with Excesses, and slept only to
  prepare themselves for the Repetition of them. If you did your Duty as
  a SPECTATOR, you would carefully examine into the Number of Births,
  Marriages, and Burials; and when you had deducted out of your Deaths
  all such as went out of the World without marrying, then cast up the
  number of both Sexes born within such a Term of Years last past, you
  might from the single People departed make some useful Inferences or
  Guesses how many there are left unmarried, and raise some useful
  Scheme for the Amendment of the Age in that particular. I have not
  Patience to proceed gravely on this abominable Libertinism; for I
  cannot but reflect, as I am writing to you, upon a certain lascivious
  Manner which all our young Gentlemen use in publick, and examine our
  Eyes with a Petulancy in their own, which is a downright Affront to
  Modesty. A disdainful Look on such an Occasion is return'd with a
  Countenance rebuked, but by averting their Eyes from the Woman of
  Honour and Decency to some flippant Creature, who will, as the Phrase
  is, be kinder. I must set down things as they come into my Head,
  without standing upon Order. Ten thousand to one but the gay Gentleman
  who stared, at the same time is an House-keeper; for you must know
  they have got into a Humour of late of being very regular in their
  Sins, and a young Fellow shall keep his four Maids and three Footmen
  with the greatest Gravity imaginable. There are no less than six of
  these venerable House-keepers of my Acquaintance. This Humour among
  young Men of Condition is imitated by all the World below them, and a
  general Dissolution of Manners arises from the one Source of
  Libertinism, without Shame or Reprehension in the Male Youth. It is
  from this one Fountain that so many Beautiful helpless young Women are
  sacrific'd and given up to Lewdness, Shame, Poverty and Disease. It is
  to this also that so many excellent young Women, who might be Patterns
  of conjugal Affection and Parents of a worthy Race, pine under unhappy
  Passions for such as have not Attention enough to observe, or Virtue
  enough to prefer them to their common Wenches. Now, <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR, I
  must be free to own to you, that I my self suffer a tasteless insipid
  Being, from a Consideration I have for a Man who would not, as he has
  said in my hearing, resign his Liberty, as he calls it, for all the
  Beauty and Wealth the whole Sex is possessed of. Such Calamities as
  these would not happen, if it could possibly be brought about, that by
  fining Batchelors as Papists Convict, or the like, they were
  distinguished to their disadvantage from the rest of the World, who
  fall in with the Measures of Civil Society. Lest you should think I
  speak this as being, according to the senseless rude Phrase, a
  malicious old Maid, I shall acquaint you I am a Woman of Condition not
  now three and twenty, and have had Proposals from at least ten
  different Men, and the greater Number of them have upon the Upshot
  refused me. Something or other is always amiss when the Lover takes to
  some new Wench: A Settlement is easily excepted against; and there is
  very little Recourse to avoid the vicious Part of our Youth, but
  throwing one's self away upon some lifeless Blockhead, who tho' he is
  without Vice, is also without Virtue. Now-a-days we must be contented
  if we can get Creatures which are not bad, good are not to be
  expected. Mr. SPECTATOR, I sat near you the other Day, and think I did
  not displease you Spectatorial Eyesight; which I shall be a better
  Judge of when I see whether you take notice of these Evils your own
  way, or print this Memorial dictated from the disdainful heavy Heart
  of,<br>
<br>
  <i><b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  <i>Your most obedient humble Servant</i>,<br>
<br>
Rachael Welladay.

<br>

Upon the hearing of several late Disputes concerning Rank and
Precedence, I could not forbear amusing my self with some Observations,
which I have made upon the Learned World, as to this great Particular.
By the Learned World I here mean at large, all those who are any way
concerned in Works of Literature, whether in the Writing, Printing or
Repeating Part. To begin with the Writers; I have observed that the
Author of a <i>Folio</i>, in all Companies and Conversations, sets himself
above the Author of a <i>Quarto</i>; the Author of a <i>Quarto</i> above the
Author of an <i>Octavo</i>; and so on, by a gradual Descent and
Subordination, to an Author in <i>Twenty Fours</i>. This Distinction is so
well observed, that in an Assembly of the Learned, I have seen a <i>Folio</i>
Writer place himself in an Elbow-Chair, when the Author of a
<i>Duo-decimo</i> has, out of a just Deference to his superior Quality,
seated himself upon a Squabb. In a word, Authors are usually ranged in
Company after the same manner as their Works are upon a Shelf.<br>
<br>
The most minute Pocket-Author hath beneath him the Writers of all
Pamphlets, or Works that are only stitched. As for the Pamphleteer, he
takes place of none but of the Authors of single Sheets, and of that
Fraternity who publish their Labours on certain Days, or on every Day of
the Week. I do not find that the Precedency among the Individuals, in
this latter Class of Writers, is yet settled.<br>
<br>
For my own part, I have had so strict a regard to the Ceremonial which
prevails in the Learned World, that I never presumed to take place of a
Pamphleteer till my daily Papers were gathered into those two first
Volumes, which have already appeared. After which, I naturally jumped
over the Heads not only of all Pamphleteers, but of every <i>Octavo</i>
Writer in <i>Great Britain</i>, that had written but one Book. I am also
informed by my Bookseller, that six <i>Octavo's</i> have at all times been
look'd upon as an Equivalent to a <i>Folio</i>, which I take notice of the
rather, because I would not have the Learned World surprized, if after
the Publication of half a dozen Volumes I take my Place accordingly.
When my scattered Forces are thus rallied, and reduced into regular
Bodies, I flatter my self that I shall make no despicable Figure at the
Head of them.<br>
<br>
Whether these Rules, which have been received time out of Mind in the
Common-Wealth of Letters, were not originally established with an Eye to
our Paper Manufacture, I shall leave to the Discussion of others, and
shall only remark further in this place, that all Printers and
Booksellers take the Wall of one another, according to the
abovementioned Merits of the Authors to whom they respectively belong.<br>
<br>
I come now to that point of Precedency which is settled among the three
Learned Professions, by the Wisdom of our Laws. I need not here take
Notice of the Rank which is allotted to every Doctor in each of these
Professions, who are all of them, though not so high as Knights, yet a
Degree above Squires; this last Order of Men being the illiterate Body
of the Nation, are consequently thrown together into a Class below the
three Learned Professions. I mention this for the sake of several Rural
'Squires, whose Reading does not rise so high as to <i>the Present State
of England</i>, and who are often apt to usurp that Precedency which by the
Laws of their Country is not due to them. Their Want of Learning, which
has planted them in this Station, may in some measure extenuate their
Misdemeanour; and our Professors ought to pardon them when they offend
in this Particular, considering that they are in a State of Ignorance,
or, as we usually say, do not know their Right Hand from their Left.<br>
<br>
There is another Tribe of Persons who are Retainers to the Learned
World, and who regulate themselves upon all Occasions by several Laws
peculiar to their Body. I mean the Players or Actors of both Sexes.
Among these it is a standing and uncontroverted Principle, that a
Tragedian always takes place of a Comedian; and 'tis very well known the
merry Drolls who make us laugh are always placed at the lower End of the
Table, and in every Entertainment give way to the Dignity of the Buskin.
It is a Stage Maxim, <i>Once a King, and always a King</i>. For this Reason
it would be thought very absurd in Mr. Bullock, notwithstanding the
Height and Gracefulness of his Person, to sit at the Right Hand of an
Hero, tho' he were but five Foot high. The same Distinction is observed
among the Ladies of the Theatre. Queens and Heroines preserve their Rank
in private Conversation, while those who are Waiting-Women and Maids of
Honour upon the Stage, keep their Distance also behind the Scenes.<br>
<br>
I shall only add, that by a Parity of Reason, all Writers of Tragedy
look upon it as their due to be seated, served, or saluted before Comick
Writers: Those who deal in Tragi-Comedy usually taking their Seats
between the Authors of either Side. There has been a long Dispute for
Precedency between the Tragick and Heroick Poets. <i>Aristotle</i> would have
the latter yield the <i>Pas</i> to the former, but Mr. <i>Dryden</i> and many
others would never submit to this Decision. Burlesque Writers pay the
same Deference to the Heroick, as Comick Writers to their Serious
Brothers in the Drama.<br>
<br>
By this short Table of Laws, Order is kept up, and Distinction preserved
in the whole Republick of Letters.<br>

It is very usual for those who have been severe upon Marriage, in some
part or other of their Lives to enter into the Fraternity which they
have ridiculed, and to see their Raillery return upon their own Heads. I
scarce ever knew a Woman-hater that did not, sooner or later, pay for
it. Marriage, which is a Blessing to another Man, falls upon such a one
as a Judgment. <a name="fr5301"></a>Mr. <i>Congreve's Old Batchelor</i><a href="#f5301"><sup>1</sup></a> is set forth to us
with much Wit and Humour, as an Example of this kind. In short, those
who have most distinguished themselves by railing at the Sex in general,
very often make an honourable Amends, by chusing one of the most
worthless Persons of it, for a Companion and Yoke-fellow. <i>Hymen</i> takes
his Revenge in kind, on those who turn his Mysteries into Ridicule.<br>
<br>
My Friend <i>Will Honeycomb</i>, who was so unmercifully witty upon the
Women, in a couple of Letters, which I lately communicated to the
Publick, has given the Ladies ample Satisfaction by marrying a Farmer's
Daughter; a piece of News which came to our Club by the last Post. The
<i>Templer</i> is very positive that he has married a Dairy-maid: But <i>Will,</i>
in his Letter to me on this Occasion, sets the best Face upon the Matter
that he can, and gives a more tollerable Account of his Spouse. I must
confess I suspected something more than ordinary, when upon opening the
Letter I found that <i>Will</i> was fallen off from his former Gayety, having
changed <i>Dear Spec.</i> which was his usual Salute at the Beginning of the
Letter, into <i>My Worthy Friend</i>, and subscribed himself in the latter
End of it at full length <i>William Honeycomb</i>. In short, the gay, the
loud, <a name="fr5302">the</a> vain <i>Will Honeycomb</i>, who had made Love to every great
Fortune that has appeared in Town for <span style="color: #663300;">above</span><a href="#f5302"><sup>2</sup></a> thirty Years together,
and boasted of Favours from Ladies whom he had never seen, is at length
wedded to a plain Country Girl.<br>
<br>
His Letter gives us the Picture of a converted Rake. The sober Character
of the Husband is dashed with the Man of the Town, and enlivened with
those little Cant-phrases which have made my Friend <i>Will</i> often thought
very pretty Company. But let us hear what he says for himself.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <i>My Worthy Friend</i>,<br>
<br>
  I question not but you, and the rest of my Acquaintance, wonder that
  I, who have lived in the Smoak and Gallantries of the Town for thirty
  Years together, should all on a sudden grow fond of a Country Life.
  <a name="fr5303">Had</a> not my Dog<span style="color: #663300;"> of a</span><a href="#f5303"><sup>3</sup></a> Steward run away as he did, without making
  up his Accounts, I had still been immersed in Sin and Sea-Coal. But
  since my late forced Visit to my Estate, I am so pleased with it, that
  I am resolved to live and die upon it. I am every Day abroad among my
  Acres, and can scarce forbear filling my Letter with Breezes, Shades,
  Flowers, Meadows, and purling Streams. The Simplicity of Manners,
  which I have heard you so often speak of, and which appears here in
  Perfection, charms me wonderfully. As an Instance of it, I must
  acquaint you, and by your means the whole Club, that I have lately
  married one of my Tenants Daughters. She is born of honest Parents,
  and though she has no Portion, she has a great deal of Virtue. The
  natural Sweetness and Innocence of her Behaviour, the Freshness of her
  Complection, the unaffected Turn of her Shape and Person, shot me
  through and through every time I saw her, and did more Execution upon
  me in Grogram, than the greatest Beauty in Town or Court had ever done
  in Brocade. In short, she is such an one as promises me a good Heir to
  my Estate; and if by her means I cannot leave to my Children what are
  falsely called the Gifts of Birth; high Titles and Alliances: I hope
  to convey to them the more real and valuable Gifts of Birth; strong
  Bodies, and Healthy Constitutions. As for your fine Women, I need not
  tell thee that I know them. I have had my share in their Graces, but
  no more of that. It shall be my Business hereafter to live the Life of
  an honest Man, and to act as becomes the Master of a Family. I
  question not but I shall draw upon me the Raillery of the Town, and be
  treated to the Tune of the <i>Marriage-Hater match'd;</i> but I am prepared
  for it. I have been as witty upon others in my time. To tell thee
  truly, I saw such a Tribe of Fashionable young fluttering Coxcombs
  shot up, that I did not think my Post of an <i>homme de ruelle</i> any
  longer tenable. I felt a certain Stiffness in my Limbs, which entirely
  destroyed that Jauntyness of Air I was once Master of. Besides, for I
  may now confess my Age to thee, I have been eight and forty above
  these Twelve Years. Since my Retirement into the Country will make a
  Vacancy in the Club, I could wish you would fill up my Place with my
  Friend <i>Tom Dapperwit</i>. He has an infinite deal of Fire, and knows the
  Town. For my own part, as I have said before, I shall endeavour to
  live hereafter suitable to a Man in my Station, as a prudent Head of a
  Family, a good Husband, a careful Father (when it shall so happen) and
  as<br>
<br>
<i>Your most Sincere Friend,<br>
and Humble Servant</i>,<br>

Simonides <a name="fr5311">being</a> ask'd by <i>Dionysius</i> the Tyrant what God was, de<b>Sir</b> ed a
Day's time to consider of it before he made his Reply. When the Day was
expired, he de<b>Sir</b> ed two Days; and afterwards, instead of returning his
Answer, demanded still double the Time to consider of it. This great
Poet and Philosopher, the more he contemplated the Nature of the Deity,
found that he waded but the more out of his Depth; and that he lost
himself in the Thought, instead of finding an End of it<a href="#f5311"><sup>1</sup></a>.<br>
<br>
If we consider the Idea which wise Men, by the Light of Reason, have
framed of the Divine Being, it amounts to this: That he has in him all
the Perfection of a Spiritual Nature; and since we have no Notion of any
kind of spiritual Perfection but what we discover in our own Souls, we
joyn Infinitude to each kind of these Perfections, and what is a Faculty
in an human Soul becomes an Attribute in God. <i>We</i> exist in Place and
Time, the Divine Being fills the Immensity of Space with his Presence,
and Inhabits Eternity. <i>We</i> are possessed of a little Power and a little
Knowledge, the Divine Being is Almighty and Omniscient. In short, by
adding Infinity to any kind of Perfection we enjoy, and by joyning all
these different kinds of Perfections in one Being, we form our Idea of
the great Sovereign of Nature.<br>
<br>
Though every one who thinks must have made this Observation, I shall
<a name="fr5312">produce</a> Mr. <i>Locke's</i> Authority to the same purpose, out of his <i>Essay on
Human Understanding.</i>

<blockquote>
  <i>If we examine the</i> Idea <i>we have of the incomprehensible Supreme
  Being, we shall find, that we come by it the same way; and that the
  complex</i> Ideas <i>we have both of God and separate Spirits, are made up
  of the simple</i> Ideas <i>we receive from</i> Reflection: <i>e. g. having from
  what we experiment in our selves, got the</i> Ideas <i>of Existence and
  Duration, of Knowledge and Power, of Pleasure and Happiness, and of
  several other Qualities and Powers, which it is better to have, than
  to be without; when we would frame an</i> Idea <i>the most suitable we can
  to the Supreme Being, we enlarge every one of these with our</i> Idea <i>of
  Infinity; and so putting them together, make our Complex</i> Idea of
  God.<a href="#f5312"><sup>2</sup></a></blockquote>

It is not impossible that there may be many kinds of Spiritual
Perfection, besides those which are lodged in an human Soul; but it is
impossible that we should have Ideas of any kinds of Perfection, except
those of which we have some small Rays and short imperfect Strokes in
our selves. It would be therefore a very high Presumption to determine
whether the Supream Being has not many more Attributes than those which
enter into our Conceptions of him. This is certain, that if there be any
kind of Spiritual Perfection which is not marked out in an human Soul,
it belongs in its Fulness to the Divine Nature.<br>
<br>
Several eminent Philosophers have imagined that the Soul, in her
separate State, may have new Faculties springing up in her, which she is
not capable of exerting during her present Union with the Body; and
whether these Faculties may not correspond with other Attributes in the
Divine Nature, and open to us hereafter new Matter of Wonder and
Adoration, we are altogether ignorant. <a name="fr5313">This</a>, as I have said before, we
ought to acquiesce in, that the Sovereign Being, the great Author of
Nature, has in him all possible Perfection, as well in <i>Kind</i> as in
<i>Degree</i>; to speak according to our Methods of <span style="color: #663300;">conceiving</span><a href="#f5313"><sup>3</sup></a>. I shall
only add under this Head, that when we have raised our Notion of this
Infinite Being as high as it is possible for the Mind of Man to go, it
will fall infinitely short of what He really is. <i>There is no end of his
Greatness</i>: The most exalted Creature he has made, is only capable of
adoring it, none but himself can comprehend it.<br>
<br>
The Advice of <a name="fr5314">the</a> Son of <i><b>Sir</b> ach</i> is very just and sublime in this
Light. 

<blockquote><i>By his Word all things consist. We may speak much, and yet come
  short: wherefore in sum, he is all. How shall we be able to magnify
  him? For he is great above all his Works. The Lord is terrible and
  very great; and marvellous in his Power. When you glorify the Lord,
  exalt him as much as you can; for even yet will he far exceed. And
  when you exalt him, put forth all your strength, and be not weary; for
  you can never go far enough. Who hath seen him, that he might tell us?
  And who can magnify him as he is? There are yet hid greater things
  than these be, for we have seen but a few of his Works.</i><a href="#f5314"><sup>4</sup></a></blockquote>

I have here only considered the Supreme Being by the Light of Reason and
Philosophy. If we would see him in all the Wonders of his Mercy we must
have recourse to Revelation, which represents him to us, not only as
infinitely Great and Glorious, but as infinitely Good and Just in his
Dispensations towards Man. But as this is a Theory which falls under
every one's Consideration, tho' indeed it can never be sufficiently
considered, I shall here only take notice of that habitual Worship and
Veneration which we ought to pay to this Almighty Being. We should often
refresh our Minds with the Thought of him, and annihilate our selves
before him, in the Contemplation of our own Worthlessness, and of his
transcendent Excellency and Perfection. This would imprint in our Minds
such a constant and uninterrupted Awe and Veneration as that which I am
here recommending, and which is in reality a kind of incessant Prayer,
and reasonable Humiliation of the Soul before him who made it.<br>
<br>
This would effectually kill in us all the little Seeds of Pride, Vanity
and Self-conceit, which are apt to shoot up in the Minds of such whose
Thoughts turn more on those comparative Advantages which they enjoy over
some of their Fellow-Creatures, than on that infinite Distance which is
placed between them and the Supreme Model of all Perfection. It would
likewise quicken our De<b>Sir</b> es and Endeavours of uniting our selves to him
by all the Acts of Religion and Virtue.<br>
<br>
Such an habitual Homage to the Supreme Being would, in a particular
manner, banish from among us that prevailing Impiety of using his Name
on the most trivial Occasions.<br>
<br>
I find the following Passage in an excellent Sermon, preached at the
Funeral of <a name="fr5315">a</a> Gentleman who was an Honour to his Country, and a more
diligent as well as successful Enquirer into the Works of Nature, than
any other our Nation has ever produced<a href="#f5315"><sup>5</sup></a>.

<blockquote>  'He had the profoundest Veneration for the Great God of Heaven and
  Earth that I have ever observed in any Person. The very Name of God
  was never mentioned by him without a Pause and a visible Stop in his
  Discourse; in which, one that knew him most particularly above twenty
  Years, has told me, that he was so exact, that he does not remember to
  have observed him once to fail in it.'</blockquote>

Every one knows the Veneration which was paid by the <i>Jews</i> to a Name so
great, wonderful and holy. They would not let it enter even into their
religious Discourses. What can we then think of those who make use of so
tremendous a Name in the ordinary Expressions of their Anger, Mirth, and
most impertinent Passions? Of those who admit it into the most familiar
Questions and Assertions, ludicrous Phrases and Works of Humour? not to
mention those who violate it by solemn Perjuries? It would be an Affront
to Reason to endeavour to set forth the Horror and Prophaneness of such
a Practice. The very mention of it exposes it sufficiently to those in
whom the Light of Nature, not to say Religion, is not utterly
extinguished.<br>

It is a very honest Action to be studious to produce other Men's Merit;
and I make no scruple of saying I have as much of this Temper as any Man
in the World. It would not be a thing to be bragged of, but that it is
what any Man may be Master of who will take Pains enough for it. Much
Observation of the Unworthiness in being pained at the Excellence of
another, will bring you to a Scorn of yourself for that Unwillingness:
And when you have got so far, you will find it a greater Pleasure than
you ever before knew, to be zealous in promoting the Fame and Welfare of
the Praise-worthy. I do not speak this as pretending to be a mortified
self-denying Man, but as one who has turned his Ambition into a right
Channel. I <a name="fr5321">claim</a> to my self the Merit of having extorted excellent
Productions from a Person of the greatest Abilities<a href="#f5321"><sup>1</sup></a>, who would not
have let them appear by any other Means; to have animated a few young
Gentlemen into worthy Pursuits, who will be a Glory to our Age; and at
all Times, and by all possible Means in my Power, undermined the
Interests of Ignorance, Vice, and Folly, and attempted to substitute in
their Stead, Learning, Piety, and good Sense. It is from this honest
Heart that I find myself honoured as a Gentleman-Usher to the Arts and
Sciences. Mr. <i>Tickell</i> and Mr. <i>Pope</i> have, it seems, this Idea of me.
The former has writ me an excellent Paper of Verses in Praise, forsooth,
of my self; and <a name="fr5322">the</a> other enclosed for my perusal an admirable Poem<a href="#f5322"><sup>2</sup></a>,
which, I hope, will shortly see the Light. In the mean time I cannot
suppress any Thought of his, but insert his Sentiment about the dying
Words of <i>Adrian</i>. I won't determine in the Case he mentions; but have
thus much to say in favour of his Argument, that many of his own Works
which I have seen, convince me that very pretty and very sublime
Sentiments may be lodged in the same Bosom without diminution to its
Greatness.<br>

<blockquote>  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'I was the other day in Company with five or six Men of some Learning;
  where chancing to mention the famous Verses which the Emperor <i>Adrian</i>
  spoke on his Death-bed, they were all agreed that 'twas a Piece of
  Gayety unworthy that Prince in those Circumstances. I could not but
  dissent from this Opinion: Methinks it was by no means a gay, but a
  very serious Soliloquy to his Soul at the Point of his Departure: in
  which Sense I naturally took the Verses at my first reading them when
  I was very young, and before I knew what Interpretation the World
  generally put upon them:

<blockquote>'<i>Animula vagula, blandula,<br>
Hospes Comesque corporis,<br>
Qu&aelig; nunc abibis in loca?<br>
Pallidula, rigida, nudula,<br>
Nec (ut soles) dabis Joca!<br>
<br>
    'Alas, my Soul! thou pleasing Companion of this Body, thou fleeting
    thing that art now deserting it! whither art thou flying? to what
    unknown Region? Thou art all trembling, fearful, and pensive. Now
    what is become of thy former Wit and Humour? thou shall jest and be
    gay no more.</i></blockquote>

'I confess I cannot apprehend where lies the Trifling in all this; 'tis
  the most natural and obvious Reflection imaginable to a dying Man: and
  if we consider the Emperor was a Heathen, that Doubt concerning the
  Future Fate of his Soul will seem so far from being the Effect of Want
  of Thought, that 'twas scarce reasonable he should think otherwise;
  not to mention that here is a plain Confession included of his Belief
  in its Immortality. The diminutive Epithets of <i>Vagula, Blandula</i>, and
  the rest, appear not to me as Expressions of Levity, but rather of
  Endearment and Concern; such as we find in <i>Catullus</i>, and the Authors
  of <i>Hendeca-syllabi</i> after him, where they are used to express the
  utmost Love and Tenderness for their Mistresses&mdash;If <a name="fr5323">you</a> think me right
  in my Notion of the last Words of <i>Adrian</i>, be pleased to insert this
  in the <i>Spectator</i>; if not, to suppress it.'<a href="#f5323"><sup>3</sup></a><br>

<a name="f5323"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote 3:</span></a> &nbsp;Pope republished this in his <i>Letters</i> in 1735, adding a
metrical translation of Adrian's lines:

  <blockquote><i>Ah, fleeting spirit! wandering fire,<br>
    That long hast warm'd my tender breast,<br>
  Must thou no more this frame inspire?<br>
    No more a pleasing, cheerful guest?<br>
  Whither, ah, whither art thou flying,<br>
    To what dark, undiscovered shore?<br>
  Thou seem'st all trembling, shivering, dying,<br>
    And wit and humour are no more.</i></blockquote>

Two days after the insertion of this letter from Pope, Steele wrote to
the young poet (Nov. 12):

 <blockquote> 'I have read over your "Temple of Fame" twice; and cannot find
  anything amiss of weight enough to call a fault, but see in it a
  thousand thousand beauties. Mr. Addison shall see it to-morrow: after
  his perusal of it I will let you know his thoughts. I de<b>Sir</b> e you would
  let me know whether you are at leisure or not? I have a design which I
  shall open a month or two hence, with the assistance of a few like
  yourself. If your thoughts are unengaged I shall explain myself
  further.'</blockquote>

This design was the <i>Guardian</i>, which Steele was about to establish as
the successor to the <i>Spectator</i>; and here we find him at work on the
foundations of his new journal while the finishing strokes are being
given to the <i>Spectator</i>. Pope in his reply to Steele said (Nov. 16):

 <blockquote> 'I shall be very ready and glad to contribute to any design that tends
  to the advantage of mankind, which, I am sure, all yours do. I wish I
  had but as much capacity as leisure, for I am perfectly idle (a sign I
  have not much capacity). If you will entertain the best opinion of me,
  be pleased to think me your friend. Assure Mr. Addison of my most
  faithful service; of every one's esteem he must be assured already.'</blockquote>

About a fortnight later, returning to the subject of Adrian's verses,
Pope wrote to Steele in reply to subsequent private discussion of the
subject (Nov. 29):

  <blockquote>'I am sorry you published that notion about Adrian's verses as mine;
  had I imagined you would use my name, I should have expressed my
  sentiments with more modesty and diffidence. I only wrote to have your
  opinion, and not to publish my own, which I distrusted.'</blockquote>
  
Then after defending his view of the poem, and commenting upon the Latin
diminutives, he adds,

 <blockquote> 'perhaps I should be much better pleased if I were told you called me
  "your little friend," than if you complimented me with the title of "a
  great genius," or "an eminent hand," as Jacob [Tonson] does all his
  authors.'</blockquote>

Steele's genial reply produced from Pope, as final result of the above
letter to the <i>Spectator</i>, one of the most popular of his short pieces.
Steele wrote (Dec. 4):

  <blockquote>'This is to de<b>Sir</b> e of you that you would please to make an ode as of a
  cheerful dying spirit; that is to say, the Emperor Adrian's "<i>animula
  vagula</i>," put into two or three stanzas for music. If you will comply
  with this, and send me word so, you will very particularly oblige
  <b>Richard Steele.</b>'</blockquote>

This was written two days before the appearance of the last number of
his <i>Spectator</i>. Pope answered,

 <blockquote> 'I do not send you word I will do, but have already done the thing you
  de<b>Sir</b> e of me,'</blockquote>

and sent his poem of three stanzas, called <b>The Dying Christian To His
Soul.</b>

 <blockquote><i> Vital spark of heavenly flame, &amp;c.</i></blockquote>

These two letters were published by Warburton, but are not given by Pope
in the edition of his correspondence, published in 1737, and the poem
has no place in the collected works of 1717. It has been said that if
the piece had been written in 1712 Steele would have inserted it in the
<i>Spectator</i>. But it was not received until the last number of the
<i>Spectator</i> had been published. Three months then elapsed before the
appearance of the <i>Guardian</i>, to which Pope contributed eight papers.
Pope, on his part, would be naturally unwilling to connect with the poem
the few words he had sent with it to Steele, saying,

  <blockquote>'You have it (as Cowley calls it) just warm from the brain. It came to
  me the first moment I waked this morning. Yet, you will see, it was
  not so absolutely inspiration, but that I had in my head not only the
  verses of Adrian, but the fine fragment of Sappho, &amp;c.'</blockquote>

The &amp;c. being short for Thomas Flatman, whose name would not have stood
well by that of Sappho, though he was an accomplished man in his day,
who gave up law for poetry and painting, and died in 1688, one of the
best miniature painters of his time, and the author of <i>Songs and
Poems,</i> published in 1674, which in ten years went through three
editions. Flatman had written:

  <blockquote><i>When on my sick-bed I languish,<br>
  Full of sorrow, full of anguish,<br>
  Fainting, gasping, trembling, crying,<br>
  Panting, groaning, speechless, dying;<br>
  Methinks I hear some gentle spirit say,<br>
  "Be not fearful, come away!"</i></blockquote>

  <i>To the</i> SPECTATOR.<br>
<br>
  <i><b>Sir</b> ,</i><br>
<br>
  'You have often given us very excellent Discourses against that
  unnatural Custom of Parents, in forcing their Children to marry
  contrary to their Inclinations. My own Case, without further Preface,
  I will lay before you, and leave you to judge of it. My Father and
  Mother both being in declining Years, would fain see me, their eldest
  Son, as they call it settled. I am as much for that as they can be;
  but I must be settled, it seems, not according to my own, but their
  liking. Upon this account I am teaz'd every Day, because I have not
  yet fallen in love, in spite of Nature, with one of a neighbouring
  Gentleman's Daughters; for out of their abundant Generosity, they give
  me the choice of four. <i>Jack</i>, begins my Father, Mrs. <i>Catherine</i> is a
  fine Woman&mdash;Yes, <b>Sir</b> , but she is rather too old&mdash;She will make the
  more discreet Manager, Boy. Then my Mother plays her part. Is not Mrs.
  <i>Betty</i> exceeding fair? Yes, Madam, but she is of no Conversation; she
  has no Fire, no agreeable Vivacity; she neither speaks nor looks with
  Spirit. True, Son; but for those very Reasons, she will be an easy,
  soft, obliging, tractable Creature. After all, cries an old Aunt, (who
  belongs to the Class of those who read Plays with Spectacles on) what
  think you, Nephew, of proper Mrs. <i>Dorothy</i>? What do I think? why I
  think she cannot be above six foot two inches high. Well, well, you
  may banter as long as you please, but Height of Stature is commanding
  and majestick. Come, come, says a Cousin of mine in the Family, I'll
  fit him; <i>Fidelia</i> is yet behind&mdash;Pretty Miss <i>Fiddy</i> must please
  you&mdash;Oh! your very humble Servant, dear Cos. she is as much too young
  as her eldest Sister is too old. Is it so indeed, quoth she, good Mr.
  <i>Pert</i>? You who are but barely turned of twenty two, and Miss Fiddy in
  half a Year's time will be in her Teens, and she is capable of
  learning any thing. Then she will be so observant; she'll cry perhaps
  now and then, but never be angry. Thus they will think for me in this
  matter, wherein I am more particularly concerned than any Body else.
  If I name any Woman in the World, one of these Daughters has certainly
  the same Qualities. You see by these few Hints, <i>Mr.</i> SPECTATOR, what
  a comfortable Life I lead. To be still more open and free with you, I
  have been passionately fond of a young Lady (whom give me leave to
  call <i>Miranda</i>) now for these three Years. I have often urged the
  Matter home to my Parents with all the Submission of a Son, but the
  Impatience of a Lover. Pray, <b>Sir</b> , think of three Years; what
  inexpressible Scenes of Inquietude, what Variety of Misery must I have
  gone thro' in three long whole Years? <i>Miranda's</i> Fortune is equal to
  those I have mention'd; but her Relations are not Intimates with mine.
  Ah! there's the Rub. <i>Miranda's</i> Person, Wit, and Humour, are what the
  nicest Fancy could imagine; and though we know you to be so elegant a
  Judge of Beauty, yet there is none among all your various Characters
  of fine Women preferable to <i>Miranda</i>. In a Word, she is never guilty
  of doing any thing but one amiss, (if she can be thought to do amiss
  by me) in being as blind to my Faults, as she is to her own
  Perfections.<br>

  <i>Mr.</i> SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'When you spent so much time as you did lately in censuring the
  ambitious young Gentlemen who ride in Triumph through Town and Country
  in Coach-boxes, I wished you had employed those Moments in
  consideration of what passes sometimes within-side of those Vehicles.
  I am sure I suffered sufficiently by the Insolence and Ill-breeding of
  some Persons who travelled lately with me in a Stage-Coach out of
  <i>Essex</i> to <i>London</i>. I am sure, when you have heard what I have to
  say, you will think there are Persons under the Character of Gentlemen
  that are fit to be no where else but in the Coach-box. <b>Sir</b> , I am a
  young Woman of a sober and religious Education, and have preserved
  that Character; but on Monday was Fortnight it was my Misfortune to
  come to <i>London</i>. I was no sooner clapt in the Coach, but to my great
  Surprize, two Persons in the Habit of Gentlemen attack'd me with such
  indecent Discourse as I cannot repeat to you, so you may conclude not
  fit for me to hear. I had no relief but the Hopes of a speedy End of
  my short Journey. <b>Sir</b> , form to your self what a Persecution this must
  needs be to a virtuous and a chaste Mind; and in order to your proper
  handling such a Subject, fancy your Wife or Daughter, if you had any,
  in such Circumstances, and what Treatment you would think then due to
  such Dragoons. One of them was called a Captain, and entertained us
  with nothing but silly stupid Questions, or lewd Songs, all the way.
  Ready to burst with Shame and Indignation, I repined that Nature had
  not allowed us as easily to shut our Ears as our Eyes. But was not
  this a kind of Rape? Why should there be Accessaries in Ravishment any
  more than Murder? Why should not every Contributor to the Abuse of
  Chastity suffer Death? I am sure these shameless Hell-hounds deserved
  it highly. Can you exert your self better than on such an Occasion? If
  you do not do it effectually, I 'll read no more of your Papers. Has
  every impertinent Fellow a Privilege to torment me, who pay my
  Coach-hire as well as he? <b>Sir</b> , pray consider us in this respect as the
  weakest Sex, and have nothing to defend our selves; and I think it as
  Gentleman-like to challenge a Woman to fight, as to talk obscenely in
  her Company, especially when she has not power to stir. Pray let me
  tell you a Story which you can make fit for publick View. I knew a
  Gentleman, who having a very good Opinion of the Gentlemen of the
  Army, invited ten or twelve of them to sup with him; and at the same
  time invited two or three Friends, who were very severe against the
  Manners and Morals of Gentlemen of that Profession. It happened one of
  them brought two Captains of his Regiment newly come into the Army,
  who at first Onset engaged the Company with very lewd Healths and
  suitable Discourse. You may easily imagine the Confusion of the
  Entertainer, who finding some of his Friends very uneasy, de<b>Sir</b> ed to
  tell them a Story of a great Man, one Mr, <i>Locke</i> (whom I find you
  frequently mention) that being invited to dine with the then Lords
  <i>Hallifax, Anglesey</i>, and <i>Shaftsbury</i>; immediately after Dinner,
  instead of Conversation, the Cards were called for, where the bad or
  good Success produced the usual Passions of Gaming. Mr. <i>Locke</i>
  retiring to a Window, and writing, my Lord <i>Anglesey</i> de<b>Sir</b> ed to know
  what he was writing: <i>Why, my Lords</i>, answered he, <i>I could not sleep
  last Night for the Pleasure and Improvement I expected from the
  Conversation of the greatest Men of the Age</i>. This so sensibly stung
  them, that they gladly compounded to throw their Cards in the Fire if
  he would his Paper, and so a Conversation ensued fit for such Persons.
  This Story prest so hard upon the young Captains, together with the
  Concurrence of their superior Officers, that the young Fellows left
  the Company in Confusion. <b>Sir</b> , I know you hate long things; but if you
  like it, you may contract it, or how you will; but I think it has a
  Moral in it.<br>
<br>
  But, <b>Sir</b> , I am told you are a famous Mechanick as well as a Looker-on,
  and therefore humbly propose you would invent some Padlock, with full
  Power under your Hand and Seal, for all modest Persons, either Men or
  Women, to clap upon the Mouths of all such impertinent impudent
  Fellows: And I wish you would publish a Proclamation, that no modest
  Person who has a Value for her Countenance, and consequently would not
  be put out of it, presume to travel after such a Day without one of
  them in their Pockets. I fancy a smart <i>Spectator</i> upon this Subject
  would serve for such a Padlock; and that publick Notice may be given
  in your Paper where they may be had with Directions, Price 2 <i>d</i>. and
  that part of the Directions may be, when any Person presumes to be
  guilty of the above-mentioned Crime, the Party aggrieved may produce
  it to his Face, with a Request to read it to the Company. He must be
  very much hardened that could outface that Rebuke; and his further
  Punishment I leave you to prescribe.<br>

  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'I am a young Woman of Nineteen, the only Daughter of very wealthy
  Parents; and have my whole Life been used with a Tenderness which did
  me no great Service in my Education. I have perhaps an uncommon De<b>Sir</b> e
  for Knowledge of what is suitable to my Sex and Quality; but as far as
  I can remember, the whole Dispute about me has been, whether such a
  thing was proper for the Child to do, or not? Or whether such or such
  Food was the more wholsome for the young Lady to eat? This was ill for
  my Shape, that for my Complexion, and t'other for my Eyes. I am not
  extravagant when I tell you, I do not know that I have trod upon the
  very Earth since I was ten Years old: A Coach or Chair I am obliged to
  for all my Motions from one Place to another ever since I can
  remember. All who had to do to instruct me, have ever been bringing
  Stories of the notable things I have said and the Womanly manner of my
  behaving my self upon such and such an Occasion. This has been my
  State, till I came towards Years of Womanhood; and ever since I grew
  towards the Age of Fifteen, I have been abused after another Manner.
  Now, forsooth, I am so killing, no one can safely speak to me. Our
  House is frequented by Men of Sense, and I love to ask Questions when
  I fall into such Conversation; but I am cut short with something or
  other about my bright Eyes. There is, <b>Sir</b> , a Language particular for
  talking to Women in; and none but those of the very first good
  Breeding (who are very few, and who seldom come into my way) can speak
  to us without regard to our Sex. Among the generality of those they
  call Gentlemen, it is impossible for me to speak upon any subject
  whatsoever, without provoking somebody to say, <i>Oh! to be sure fine
  Mrs. such-a-one must be very particularly acquainted with all that;
  all the World will contribute to her Entertainment and Information</i>.
  Thus, <b>Sir</b> , I am so handsome, that I murder all who approach me; so
  wise, that I want no new Notices; and so well bred, that I am treated
  by all that know me like a Fool, for no one will answer as if I were
  their Friend or Companion. Pray, <b>Sir</b> , be pleased to take the part of
  us Beauties and Fortunes into your Consideration, and do not let us be
  thus flattered out of our Senses. I have got an Hussey of a Maid, who
  is most craftily given to this ill Quality. I was at first diverted
  with a certain Absurdity the Creature was guilty of in every thing she
  said: She is a Country Girl, and in the Dialect of the Shire she was
  born in, would tell me that every body reckon'd her Lady had the
  purest Red and White in the World: Then she would tell me, I was the
  most like one <i>Sisly Dobson</i> in their Town, who made the Miller make
  away with himself, and walk afterwards in the Corn-Field where they
  used to meet. With all this, this cunning Hussey can lay Letters in my
  way, and put a Billet in my Gloves, and then stand in it she knows
  nothing of it. I do not know, from my Birth to this Day, that I have
  been ever treated by any one as I ought; and if it were not for a few
  Books which I delight in, I should be at this Hour a Novice to all
  common Sense. Would it not be worth your while to lay down Rules for
  Behaviour in this Case, and tell People, that we Fair-ones expect
  honest plain Answers as well as other People? Why must I, good <b>Sir</b> ,
  because I have a good Air, a fine Complexion, and am in the Bloom of
  my Years, be mis-led in all my Actions? and have the Notions of Good
  and Ill confounded in my Mind, for no other Offence, but because I
  have the Advantages of Beauty and Fortune? Indeed, <b>Sir</b> , what with the
  silly Homage which is paid to us by the sort of People I have above
  spoken of, and the utter Negligence which others have for us, the
  Conversation of us young Women of Condition is no other than what must
  expose us to Ignorance and Vanity, if not Vice. All this is humbly
  submitted to your Spectatorial Wisdom, by,<br>

<br>
  I was a wealthy Grocer in the City, and as fortunate as diligent; but
  I was a single Man, and you know there are Women. One in particular
  came to my Shop, who I wished might, but was afraid never would, make
  a Grocer's Wife. I thought, however, to take an effectual Way of
  Courting, and sold to her at less Price than I bought, that I might
  buy at less Price than I sold. She, you may be sure, often came, and
  helped me to many Customers at the same Rate, fancying I was obliged
  to her. You must needs think this was a good living Trade, and my
  Riches must be vastly improved. In fine, I was nigh being declared
  Bankrupt, when I declared my self her Lover, and she herself married.
  I was just in a Condition to support my self, and am now in Hopes of
  growing rich by losing my Customers.<br>

<br>
  I am in the Condition of the Idol you was once pleased to mention, and
  Bar-keeper of a Coffee-house. I believe it is needless to tell you the
  Opportunities I must give, and the Importunities I suffer. But there
  is one Gentleman who besieges me as close as the <i>French</i> did
  <i>Bouchain</i>. His Gravity makes him work cautious, and his regular
  Approaches denote a good Engineer. You need not doubt of his Oratory,
  as he is a Lawyer; and especially since he has had so little Use of it
  at <i>Westminster</i>, he may spare the more for me.<br>
<br>
  What then can weak Woman do? I am willing to surrender, but he would
  have it at Discretion, and I with Discretion. In the mean time, whilst
  we parly, our several Interests are neglected. As his Siege grows
  stronger, my Tea grows weaker; and while he pleads at my Bar, none
  come to him for Counsel but <i>in Forma Pauperis</i>. Dear Mr. SPECTATOR,
  advise him not to insist upon hard Articles, nor by his irregular
  De<b>Sir</b> es contradict the well-meaning Lines of his Countenance. If we
  were agreed we might settle to something, as soon as we could
  determine where we should get most, by the Law, at the Coffee-house,
  or at Westminster.<br>

<br>

My <a href="#section471">Four Hundred and Seventy First Speculation</a> turned upon the Subject of
Hope in general. I design this Paper as a Speculation upon that vain and
foolish Hope, which is misemployed on Temporal Objects, and produces
many Sorrows and Calamities in human Life.<br>
<br>
It is a Precept several times inculcated by <i>Horace</i>, that we should not
entertain an Hope of any thing in Life which lies at a great Distance
from us. The Shortness and Uncertainty of our Time here, makes such a
kind of Hope unreasonable and absurd. The Grave lies unseen between us
and the Object which we reach after: Where one Man lives to enjoy the
Good he has in view, ten thousand are cut off in the Pursuit of it.<br>
<br>
It happens likewise unluckily, that one Hope no sooner dies in us but
another rises up in its stead. We are apt to fancy that we shall be
happy and satisfied if we possess ourselves of such and such particular
Enjoyments; but either by reason of their Emptiness, or the natural
Inquietude of the Mind, we have no sooner gained one Point but we extend
our Hopes to another. We still find new inviting Scenes and Landskips
lying behind those which at a Distance terminated our View.<br>
<br>
The natural Consequences of such Reflections are these; that we should
take Care not to let our Hopes run out into too great a Length; that we
should sufficiently weigh the Objects of our Hope, whether they be such
as we may reasonably expect from them what we propose in their Fruition,
and whether they are such as we are pretty sure of attaining, in case
our Life extend itself so far. If we hope for things which are at too
great a Distance from, us, it is possible that we may be intercepted by
Death in our Progress towards them. If we hope for things of which we
have not thoroughly considered the value, our Disappointment will be
greater than our Pleasure in the Fruition of them. If we hope for what
we are not likely to possess, we act and think in vain, and make Life a
greater Dream and Shadow than it really is.<br>
<br>
Many of the Miseries and Misfortunes of Life proceed from our Want of
Consideration, in one or all of these Particulars. They are the Rocks on
which the sanguine Tribe of Lovers daily split, and on which the
Bankrupt, the Politician, the Alchymist and Projector are cast away in
every Age. Men <a name="fr5351">of</a> warm Imaginations and towring Thoughts are apt to
overlook the Goods of Fortune <span style="color: #663300;">which are</span><a href="#f5351"><sup>1</sup></a> near them, for something
that glitters in the Sight at a distance; to neglect solid and
substantial Happiness, for what is showy and superficial; and to contemn
that Good which lies within their reach, for that which they are not
capable of attaining. Hope calculates its Schemes for a long and durable
Life; presses forward to imaginary Points of Bliss; and grasps at
Impossibilities; and consequently very often ensnares Men into Beggary,
Ruin and Dishonour.<br>
<br>
What I <a name="fr5352">have</a> here said, may serve as a Moral to an <i>Arabian</i> Fable, which
I find translated into <i>French</i> by Monsieur <i>Galland</i>.<a href="#f5352"><sup>2</sup></a><br>
<br>
The Fable has in it such a wild, but natural Simplicity, that I question
not but my Reader will be as much pleased with it as I have been, and
that he will consider himself, if he reflects on the several Amusements
of Hope which have sometimes passed in his Mind, as a near Relation to
the <i>Persian</i> Glass-Man.

<blockquote>  <i>Alnaschar</i>, says the Fable, was a very idle Fellow, that never would
  set his Hand to any Business during his Father's Life. When his Father
  died, he left him to the value of an hundred Drachmas in <i>Persian</i>
  Mony. <i>Alnaschar</i>, in order to make the best of it, laid it out in
  Glasses, Bottles, and the finest Earthen Ware. These he piled up in a
  large open Basket, and having made choice of a very little Shop,
  placed the Basket at his Feet, and leaned his Back upon the Wall, in
  Expectation of Customers. As he sat in this Posture with his Eyes upon
  the Basket, he fell into a most amusing Train of Thought, and was
  over-heard by one of his Neighbours, as he talked to himself in the
  following manner: <i>This Basket</i>, says he, <i>cost me at the Wholesale
  Merchant's an Hundred Drachmas, which is all I have in the World. I
  shall quickly make two hundred of it, by selling it in Retail. These
  two hundred Drachmas will in a very little while rise to four
  Hundred, which of course will amount in time to four Thousand. Four
  Thousand Drachmas cannot fail of making Eight Thousand. As soon as by
  this means I am Master of Ten Thousand, I will lay aside my Trade of a
  Glass-Man, and turn Jeweller. I shall then deal in Diamonds, Pearls,
  and all sorts of rich Stones. When I have got together as much Wealth
  as I can well de<b>Sir</b> e, I will make a Purchase of the finest House I can
  find, with Lands, Slaves, Eunuchs and Horses. I shall then begin to
  enjoy my self, and make a noise in the World. I will not, however,
  stop there, but still continue my Traffick, till I have got together
  an Hundred Thousand Drachmas. When I have thus made my self Master of
  an hundred thousand Drachmas, I shall naturally set my self on the
  foot of a Prince, and will demand the Grand</i> Visier's <i>Daughter in
  Marriage, after having represented to that Minister the Information
  which I have received of the Beauty, Wit, Discretion, and other high
  Qualities which his Daughter possesses. I will let him know at the
  same time, that it is my Intention to make him a Present of a thousand
  Pieces of Gold on our Marriage-Night. As soon as I have married the
  Grand</i> Visier's <i>Daughter, I'll buy her ten black Eunuchs, the
  youngest and best that can be got for Mony. I must afterwards make my
  Father-in-Law a Visit with a great Train and Equipage. And when I am
  placed at his Right-hand, which he will do of course, if it be only to
  Honour his Daughter, I will give him the thousand Pieces of Gold which
  I promised him, and afterwards, to his great Surprize, will present
  him another Purse of the same Value, with some short Speech; as,</i> <b>Sir</b> ,
  you see I am a Man of my Word: I always give more than I promise.<br>
<br>
  <i>When I have brought the Princess to my House, I shall take particular
  care to breed in her a due Respect for me, before I give the Reins to
  Love and Dalliance. To this end I shall confine her to her own
  Apartment, make her a short Visit, and talk but little to her. Her
  Women will represent to me, that she is inconsolable by reason of my
  Unkindness, and beg me with Tears to caress her, and let her sit down
  by me; but I shall still remain inexorable, and will turn my Back upon
  her all the first Night. Her Mother will then come and bring her
  Daughter to me, as I am seated upon my Sofa. The Daughter, with Tears
  in her Eyes, will fling herself at my Feet, and beg of me to receive
  her into my Favour: Then will I, to imprint in her a thorough
  Veneration for my Person, draw up my Legs and spurn her from me with
  my Foot, in such a manner that she shall fall down several Paces from
  the Sofa.<br>
<br>
  Alnaschar</i> was entirely swallowed up in this Chimerical Vision, and
  could not forbear acting with his Foot what he had in his Thoughts: So
  that unluckily striking his Basket of brittle Ware, which was the
  Foundation of all his Grandeur, he kicked his Glasses to a great
  distance from him into the Street, and broke them into ten thousand
  Pieces. </blockquote>

As I was the other day standing in my Bookseller's Shop, a pretty young
Thing about Eighteen Years of Age, stept out of her Coach, and brushing
by me, beck'ned the Man of the Shop to the further end of his Counter,
where she whispered something to him with an attentive Look, and at the
same time presented him with a Letter: After which, pressing the End of
her Fan upon his Hand, she delivered the remaining part of her Message,
and withdrew. I observed, in the midst of her Discourse, that she
flushed, and cast an Eye upon me over her Shoulder, having been informed
by my Bookseller, that I was the Man of the short Face, whom she had so
often read of. Upon her passing by me, the pretty blooming Creature
smiled in my Face, and dropped me a Curtsie. She scarce gave me time to
return her Salute, before she quitted the Shop with an easie Scuttle,
and stepped again into her Coach, giving the Footman Directions to drive
where they were bid. Upon her Departure, my Bookseller gave me a Letter,
superscribed, <i>To the ingenious Spectator</i>, which the young Lady had
de<b>Sir</b> ed him to deliver into my own Hands, and to tell me that the speedy
Publication of it would not only oblige her self, but a whole Tea-Table
of my Friends. I opened it therefore, with a Resolution to publish it,
whatever it should contain, and am sure, if any of my Male Readers will
be so severely critical as not to like it, they would have been as well
pleased with it as my self, had they seen the Face of the pretty Scribe.<br>

<blockquote>  <i>London, Nov.</i> 1712.<br>
<br>
  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'You are always ready to receive any useful Hint or Proposal, and
  such, I believe, you will think one that may put you in a way to
  employ the most idle part of the Kingdom; I mean that part of Mankind
  who are known by the Name of the Womens-Men or Beaus, <i>&amp;c. Mr.</i>
  SPECTATOR, you are sensible these pretty Gentlemen are not made for
  any Manly Imployments, and for want of Business are often as much in
  the Vapours as the Ladies. Now what I propose is this, that since
  Knotting is again in fashion, which has been found a very pretty
  Amusement, that you would recommend it to these Gentlemen as something
  that may make them useful to the Ladies they admire. And since 'tis
  not inconsistent with any Game, or other Diversion, for it may be done
  in the Playhouse, in their Coaches, at the Tea-Table, and, in short,
  in all Places where they come for the sake of the Ladies (except at
  Church, be pleased to forbid it there, to prevent Mistakes) it will be
  easily complied with. 'Tis beside an Imployment that allows, as we see
  by the Fair Sex, of many Graces, which will make the Beaus more
  readily come into it; it shews a white Hand and Diamond Ring to great
  advantage; it leaves the Eyes at full liberty to be employed as
  before, as also the Thoughts, and the Tongue. In short, it seems in
  every respect so proper, that 'tis needless to urge it further, by
  speaking of the Satisfaction these Male-Knotters will find, when they
  see their Work mixed up in a Fringe, and worn by the fair Lady for
  whom and with whom it was done. Truly, <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR, I cannot but
  be pleased I have hit upon something that these Gentlemen are capable
  of; for 'tis sad so considerable a part of the Kingdom (I mean for
  Numbers) should be of no manner of use. I shall not trouble you
  farther at this time, but only to say, that I am always your Reader,
  and generally your Admirer, C. B.<br>
<br>

  there being at this time several fine Fringes that stay only for more
  Hands.'</blockquote><br>

<br>
I shall, in the next place, present my Reader with the Description of a
Set of Men who are common enough in the World, tho' I do not remember
that I have yet taken notice of them, as they are drawn in the following
Letter.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'Since you have lately, to so good purpose, enlarged upon Conjugal
  Love, it's to be hoped you'll discourage every Practice that rather
  proceeds from a regard to Interest, than to Happiness. Now you cannot
  but observe, that most of our fine young Ladies readily fall in with
  the Direction of the graver sort, to retain in their Service, by some
  small Encouragement, as great a Number as they can of supernumerary
  and insignificant Fellows, which they use like Whifflers, and commonly
  call <i>Shoeing-Horns</i>. These are never designed to know the length of
  the Foot, but only, when a good Offer comes, to whet and spur him up
  to the Point. Nay, 'tis the Opinion of that grave Lady, Madam
  <i>Matchwell</i>, that it's absolutely convenient for every prudent Family
  to have several of these Implements about the House, to clap on as
  Occasion serves, and that every Spark ought to produce a Certificate
  of his being a Shoeing-Horn, before he be admitted as a Shoe. A
  certain Lady, whom I could name, if it was necessary, has at present
  more Shoeing-Horns of all Sizes, Countries, and Colours, in her
  Service, than ever she had new Shoes in her Life. I have known a Woman
  make use of a Shoeing-Horn for several Years, and finding him
  unsuccessful in that Function, convert him at length into a Shoe. I am
  mistaken if your Friend <i>Mr</i>. <b>William Honeycomb</b>, was not a cast
  Shoeing-Horn before his late Marriage. As for my self, I must frankly
  declare to you, that I have been an errant Shoeing-Horn for above
  these twenty Years. I served my first Mistress in that Capacity above
  five of the Number, before she was shod. I confess, though she had
  many who made their Applications to her, I always thought my self the
  best Shoe in her Shop, and it was not till a Month before her Marriage
  that I discovered what I was. This had like to have broke my Heart,
  and raised such Suspicions in me, that I told the next I made Love to,
  upon receiving some unkind Usage from her, that I began to look upon
  my self as no more than her Shoeing-Horn. Upon which, my Dear, who was
  a Coquet in her Nature, told me I was Hypocondriacal, and that I might
  as well look upon my self to be an Egg or a Pipkin. But in a very
  short time after she gave me to know that I was not mistaken in my
  self. It would be tedious to recount to you the Life of an unfortunate
  Shoeing-Horn, or I might entertain you with a very long and melancholy

<br>
  <i>To the</i> SPECTATOR.<br>
<br>
  <i><b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  'It has been usual to remind Persons of Rank, on great Occasions in
  Life, of their Race and Quality, and to what Expectations they were
  born; that by considering what is worthy of them, they may be
  withdrawn from mean Pursuits, and encouraged to laudable Undertakings.
  This is turning Nobility into a Principle of Virtue, and making it
  productive of Merit, as it is understood to have been originally a
  Reward of it.<br>
<br>
  'It is for the like reason, I imagine, that you have in some of your
  Speculations asserted to your Readers the <i>Dignity of Human Nature</i>.
  But you cannot be insensible that this is a controverted Doctrine;
  there are Authors who consider Human Nature in a very different View,
  and Books of Maxims have been written to shew the <i>Falsity of all
  Human Virtues</i>. The Reflections which are made on this Subject usually
  take some Tincture from the Tempers and Characters of those that make
  them. Politicians can resolve the most shining Actions among Men into
  Artifice and Design; others, who are soured by Discontent, Repulses,
  or ill Usage, are apt to mistake their Spleen for Philosophy; Men of
  profligate Lives, and such as find themselves incapable of rising to
  any Distinction among their Fellow-Creatures, are for pulling down all
  Appearances of Merit, which seem to upbraid them: and Satirists
  describe nothing but Deformity. From all these Hands we have such
  Draughts of Mankind as are represented in those burlesque Pictures,
  which the <i>Italians</i> call <i>Caracatura's</i>; where the Art consists in
  preserving, amidst distorted Proportions and aggravated Features, some
  distinguishing Likeness of the Person, but in such a manner as to
  transform the most agreeable Beauty into the most odious Monster.<br>
<br>
  'It is very disingenuous to level the best of Mankind with the worst,
  and for the Faults of Particulars to degrade the whole Species. Such
  Methods tend not only to remove a Man's good Opinion of others, but to
  destroy that Reverence for himself, which is a great Guard of
  Innocence, and a Spring of Virtue.<br>
<br>
  'It is true indeed that there are surprizing Mixtures of Beauty and
  Deformity, of Wisdom and Folly, Virtue and Vice, in the Human Make;
  such a Disparity is found among Numbers of the same Kind, and every
  Individual, in some Instances, or at some Times, is so unequal to
  himself, that <i>Man</i> seems to be the most wavering and inconsistent
  Being in the whole Creation. So that the Question in Morality,
  concerning the Dignity of our Nature, may at first sight appear like
  some difficult Questions in Natural Philosophy, in which the Arguments
  on both Sides seem to be of equal Strength. But as I began with
  considering this Point as it relates to Action, I <a name="fr5371">shall</a> here borrow an
  admirable Reflection from Monsieur <i>Pascal</i>, which I think sets it in
  its proper Light.

<blockquote>    '<i>It is of dangerous Consequence</i>, says he, <i>to represent to Man how
    near he is to the Level of Beasts, without shewing him at the same
    time his</i> Greatness. <i>It is likewise dangerous to let him see his
    Greatness, without his</i> Meanness. <i>It is more dangerous yet to leave
    him ignorant of either; but very beneficial that he should be made
    sensible of both.</i><a href="#f5371"><sup>1</sup></a> </blockquote>

  Whatever Imperfections we may have in our Nature, it is the Business
  of Religion and Virtue to rectify them, as far as is consistent with
  our present State. In the mean time, it is no small Encouragement to
  generous Minds to consider that we shall put them all off with our
  Mortality. That sublime Manner of Salutation with which the <i>Jews</i>
  approached their Kings,

<blockquote>O King, <i>live for ever!</i></blockquote>

  may be addressed to the lowest and most despised Mortal among us,
  under all the Infirmities and Distresses with which we see him
  surrounded. And whoever believes the <i>Immortality of the Soul</i>, will
  not need a better Argument for the Dignity of his Nature, nor a
  stronger Incitement to Actions suitable to it.<br>
<br>
  'I am naturally led by this Reflection to a Subject I have already
  touched upon in a former Letter, and cannot without pleasure call to
  mind the Thoughts of <i>Cicero</i> to this purpose, in the close of his
  Book concerning <i>Old Age</i>. Every one who is acquainted with his
  Writings, will remember that the elder <i>Cato</i> is introduced in that
  Discourse as the Speaker, and <i>Scipio</i> and <i>Lelius</i> as his Auditors.
  This venerable Person is represented looking forward as it were from
  the Verge of extreme Old Age, into a future State, and rising into a
  Contemplation on the unperishable Part of his Nature, and its
  Existence after Death. I shall collect Part of his Discourse. And as
  you have formerly offered some Arguments for the Soul's Immortality,
  agreeable both to Reason and the Christian Doctrine, I believe your
  Readers will not be displeased to see how the same great Truth shines
  in the Pomp of <i>Roman</i> Eloquence.

<blockquote>    "This, says <i>Cato</i>, my firm Persuasion, that since the human Soul
    exerts it self with so great Activity, since it has such a
    Remembrance of the Past, such a Concern for the Future, since it is
    enriched with so many Arts, Sciences and Discoveries, it is
    impossible but the Being which contains all these must be Immortal.<br>
<br>
    "The <a name="fr5372">elder</a> <i>Cyrus</i>, just before his Death, is represented by
    <b>Xenophon</b> speaking after this Manner." 

<blockquote>      '<i>Think not, my dearest Children, that when I depart from you I
      shall be no more, but remember, that my Soul, even while I lived
      among you, was invisible to you; yet by my Actions you were
      sensible it existed in this Body. Believe it therefore existing
      still, though it be still unseen. How quickly would the Honours of
      illustrious Men perish after Death, if their Souls performed
      nothing to preserve their Fame? For my own part, I never could
      think that the Soul while in a mortal Body, lives, but when
      departed out of it, dies; or that its Consciousness is lost when
      it is discharged out of an unconscious Habitation. But when it is
      freed from all corporeal Alliance, then it truly exists. Further,
      since the Human Frame is broken by Death, tell us what becomes of
      its Parts? It is visible whither the Materials of other Beings are
      translated, namely to the Source from whence they had their Birth.
      The Soul alone, neither present nor departed, is the Object of our
      Eyes.</i>'<a href="#f5372"><sup>2</sup></a></blockquote>

    "Thus <i>Cyrus</i>. But to proceed. No one shall persuade me, <i>Scipio</i>,
    that your worthy Father, or your Grandfathers <i>Paulus</i> and
    <i>Africanus</i>, or <i>Africanus</i> his Father, or Uncle, or many other
    excellent Men whom I need not name, performed so many Actions to be
    remembered by Posterity, without being sensible that Futurity was
    their Right. And, if I may be allowed an old Man's Privilege, to
    speak of my self, do you think I would have endured the Fatigue of
    so many wearisome Days and Nights both at home and abroad, if I
    imagined that the same Boundary which is set to my Life must
    terminate my Glory? Were it not more de<b>Sir</b> able to have worn out my
    days in Ease and Tranquility, free from Labour, and without
    Emulation? But I know not how, my Soul has always raised it self,
    and looked forward on Futurity, in this View and Expectation, that
    when it shall depart out of Life, it shall then live for ever; and
    if this were not true, that the Mind is immortal, the Souls of the
    most worthy would not, above all others, have the strongest Impulse
    to Glory.<br>
<br>
    "What besides this is the Cause that the wisest Men die with the
    greatest &AElig;quanimity, the ignorant with the greatest Concern? Does it
    not seem that those Minds which have the most extensive Views,
    foresee they are removing to a happier Condition, which those of a
    narrower Sight do not perceive? I, for my part, am transported with
    the Hope of seeing your Ancestors, whom I have honoured and loved,
    and am earnestly de<b>Sir</b> ous of meeting not only those excellent
    Persons whom I have known, but those too of whom I have heard and
    read, and of whom I myself have written: nor would I be detained
    from so pleasing a Journey. O happy Day, when I shall escape from
    this Croud, this Heap of Pollution, and be admitted to that Divine
    Assembly of exalted Spirits! When I shall go not only to those great
    Persons I have named, but to my <i>Cato</i>, my Son, than whom a better
    Man was never born, and whose Funeral Rites I my self performed,
    whereas he ought rather to have attended mine. Yet has not his Soul
    deserted me, but, seeming to cast back a Look on me, is gone before
    to those Habitations to which it was sensible I should follow him.
    And though I might appear to have born my Loss with Courage, I was
    not unaffected with it, but I comforted myself in the Assurance that
    it would not be long before we should meet again, and be divorced no
    more.<br>

<br>

Surprize is so much the Life of Stories, that every one aims at it, who
endeavours to please by telling them. Smooth Delivery, an elegant Choice
of Words, and a sweet Arrangement, are all beautifying <i>Graces</i>, but not
the particulars in this Point of Conversation which either long command
the Attention, or strike with the Violence of a sudden Passion, or
occasion the burst of Laughter which accompanies Humour. I have
sometimes fancied that the Mind is in this case like a Traveller who
sees a fine Seat in Haste; he acknowledges the Delightfulness of a Walk
set with Regularity, but would be uneasy if he were obliged to pass it
over, when the first View had let him into all its Beauties from one End
to the other.<br>
<br>
However, a knowledge of the Success which Stories will have when they
are attended with a Turn of Surprize, as it has happily made the
Characters of some, so has it also been the Ruin of the Characters of
others. There is a Set of Men who outrage Truth, instead of affecting us
with a Manner in telling it; who over-leap the Line of Probability, that
they may be seen to move out of the common Road; and endeavour only to
make their Hearers stare, by imposing upon them with a kind of Nonsense
against the Philosophy of Nature, or such a Heap of Wonders told upon
their own Knowledge, as it is not likely one Man should ever have met
with.<br>
<br>
I have been led to this Observation by a Company into which I fell
accidentally. The Subject of <i>Antipathies</i> was a proper Field wherein
such false Surprizes might expatiate, and there were those present who
appeared very fond to shew it in its full Extent of traditional History.
Some of them, in a learned manner, offered to our Consideration the
miraculous Powers which the Effluviums of Cheese have over Bodies whose
Pores are dispos'd to receive them in a noxious manner; others gave an
account of such who could indeed bear the sight of Cheese, but not the
Taste; for which they brought a Reason from the Milk of their Nurses.
Others again discours'd, without endeavouring at Reasons, concerning an
unconquerable Aversion which some Stomachs have against a Joint of Meat
when it is whole, and the eager Inclination they have for it, when, by
its being cut up, the Shape which had affected them is altered. From
hence they passed to Eels, then to Parsnips, and so from one Aversion to
another, till we had work'd up our selves to such a pitch of
Complaisance, that when the Dinner was to come in, we enquired the name
of every Dish, and hop'd it would be no Offence to any in Company,
before it was admitted. When we had sat down, this Civility amongst us
turned the Discourse from Eatables to other sorts of Aversions; and the
eternal Cat, which plagues every Conversation of this nature, began then
to engross the Subject. One had sweated at the Sight of it, another had
smelled it out as it lay concealed in a very distant Cupboard; and he
who crowned the whole set of these Stories, reckon'd up the Number of
Times in which it had occasion'd him to swoon away. At last, says he,
that you may all be satisfy'd of my invincible Aversion to a Cat, I
shall give an unanswerable Instance: As I was going through a Street of
<i>London</i>, where I had never been till then, I felt a general Damp and
Faintness all over me, which I could not tell how to account for, till I
chanced to cast my Eyes upwards, and found that I was passing under a
Sign-Post on which the Picture of a Cat was hung.<br>
<br>
The Extravagance of this Turn in the way of Surprize, gave a stop to the
Talk we had been carrying on: Some were silent because they doubted, and
others because they were conquered in their own Way; so that the
Gentleman had Opportunity to press the Belief of it upon us, and let us
see that he was rather exposing himself than ridiculing others.<br>
<br>
I must freely own that I did not all this while disbelieve every thing
that was said; but yet I thought some in the Company had been
endeavouring who should pitch the Bar farthest; that it had for some
time been a measuring Cast, and at last my Friend of the Cat and
Sign-post had thrown beyond them all.<br>
<br>
I then consider'd the Manner in which this Story had been received, and
the Possibility that it might have pass'd for a Jest upon others, if he
had not labour'd against himself. From hence, thought I, there are two
Ways which the well-bred World generally takes to correct such a
Practice, when they do not think fit to contradict it flatly.<br>
<br>
The first of these is a general Silence, which I would not advise any
one to interpret in his own behalf. It is often the Effect of Prudence
in avoiding a Quarrel, when they see another drive so fast, that there
is no stopping him without being run against; and but very seldom the
Effect of Weakness in believing suddenly. The generality of Mankind are
not so grossly ignorant, as some over-bearing Spirits would persuade
themselves; and if the Authority of a Character or a Caution against
Danger make us suppress our Opinions, yet neither of these are of force
enough to suppress our Thoughts of them. If a Man who has endeavoured to
amuse his Company with Improbabilities could but look into their Minds,
he would find that they imagine he lightly esteems of their Sense when
he thinks to impose upon them, and that he is less esteemed by them for
his Attempt in doing so. His endeavour to glory at their Expence becomes
a Ground of Quarrel, and the Scorn and Indifference with which they
entertain it begins the immediate Punishment: And indeed (if we should
even go no further) Silence, or a negligent Indifference has a deeper
way of wounding than Opposition; because Opposition proceeds from an
Anger that has a sort of generous Sentiment for the Adversary mingling
along with it, while it shews that there is some Esteem in your Mind for
him; in short, that you think him worth while to contest with: But
Silence, or a negligent Indifference, proceeds from Anger, mixed with a
Scorn that shews another he is thought by you too contemptible to be
regarded.<br>
<br>
The other Method which the World has taken for correcting this Practice
of false Surprize, is to over-shoot such Talkers in their own Bow, or to
raise the Story with further Degrees of Impossibility, and set up for a
Voucher to them in such a manner as must let them see they stand
detected. Thus I have heard a Discourse was once managed upon the
Effects of Fear. One of the Company had given an account how it had
turn'd his Friend's Hair grey in a Night, while the Terrors of a
Shipwrack encompassed him. Another taking the Hint from hence, began,
upon his own Knowledge, to enlarge his Instances of the like nature to
such a Number, that it was not probable he could ever have met with
them; and as he still grounded these upon different Causes, for the sake
of Variety, it might seem at last, from his Share of the Conversation,
almost impossible that any one who can feel the Passion of Fear should
all his Life escape so common an Effect of it. By this time some of the
Company grew negligent, or de<b>Sir</b> ous to contradict him: But one rebuked
the rest with an appearance of Severity, and with the known old Story in
his Head, assured them they need not scruple to believe that the Fear of
any thing can make a Man's Hair grey, since he knew one whose Perriwig
had suffered so by it. Thus he stopped the Talk, and made them easy.
Thus is the same Method taken to bring us to Shame, which we fondly take
to increase our Character. It is indeed a kind of Mimickry, by which
another puts on our Air of Conversation to show us to our selves: He
seems to look ridiculous before you, that you may remember how near a
Resemblance you bear to him, or that you may know he will not lie under
the Imputation of believing you. Then it is that you are struck dumb
immediately with a conscientious Shame for what you have been saying,
Then it is that you are inwardly grieved at the Sentiments which you
cannot but perceive others entertain concerning you. In short, you are
against your self; the Laugh of the Company runs against you; the
censuring World is obliged to you for that Triumph which you have
allowed them at your own Expence; and Truth, which you have injured, has
a near way of being revenged on you, <a name="fr5381">when</a> by the bare Repetition of your

  'I am a young Widow of a good Fortune and Family, and just come to
  Town; where I find I have Clusters of pretty Fellows come already to
  visit me, some dying with Hopes, others with Fears, tho' they never
  saw me. Now what I would beg of you, would be to know whether I may
  venture to use these pert Fellows with the same Freedom as I did my
  Country Acquaintance. I de<b>Sir</b> e your Leave to use them as to me shall
  seem meet, without Imputation of a Jilt; for since I make Declaration
  that not one of them shall have me, I think I ought to be allowed the
  Liberty of insulting those who have the Vanity to believe it is in
  their power to make me break that Resolution. There are Schools for
  learning to use Foils, frequented by those who never design to fight;
  and this useless way of aiming at the Heart, without design to wound
  it on either side, is the Play with which I am resolved to divert my
  self: The Man who pretends to win, I shall use like him who comes into
  a Fencing-School to pick a Quarrel. I hope, upon this Foundation, you
  will give me the free use of the natural and artificial Force of my
  Eyes, Looks, and Gestures. As for verbal Promises, I will make none,
  but shall have no mercy on the conceited Interpreters of Glances and
  Motions. I am particularly skill'd in the downcast Eye, and the
  Recovery into a sudden full Aspect, and away again, as you may have
  seen sometimes practised by us Country Beauties beyond all that you
  have observed in Courts and Cities. Add to this, <b>Sir</b> , that I have a
  ruddy heedless Look, which covers Artifice the best of any thing. Tho'
  I can dance very well, I affect a tottering untaught way of walking,
  by which I appear an easy Prey and never exert my instructed Charms
  till I find I have engaged a Pursuer. Be pleased, <b>Sir</b> , to print this
  Letter; which will certainly begin the Chace of a rich Widow: The many
  Foldings, Escapes, Returns and Doublings which I make, I shall from
  time to time communicate to you, for the better Instruction of all
  Females who set up, like me, for reducing the present exorbitant Power

  <i>Dear Mr.</i> SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'I depend upon your profess'd Respect for virtuous Love, for your
  immediate answering the Design of this Letter; which is no other than
  to lay before the World the Severity of certain Parents who de<b>Sir</b> e to
  suspend the Marriage of a discreet young Woman of eighteen, three
  Years longer, for no other reason but that of her being too young to
  enter into that State. As to the consideration of Riches, my
  Circumstances are such, that I cannot be suspected to make my
  Addresses to her on such low Motives as Avarice or Ambition. If ever
  Innocence, Wit and Beauty, united their utmost Charms, they have in
  her. I wish you would expatiate a little on this Subject, and admonish
  her Parents that it may be from the very Imperfection of Human Nature
  it self, and not any personal Frailty of her or me, that our
  Inclinations baffled at present may alter; and while we are arguing
  with our selves to put off the Enjoyment of our present Passions, our
  Affections may change their Objects in the Operation. It is a very
  delicate Subject to talk upon; but if it were but hinted, I am in
  hopes it would give the Parties concern'd some Reflection that might
  expedite our Happiness. There is a Possibility, and I hope I may say
  it without Imputation of Immodesty to her I love with the highest
  Honour; I say, there is a Possibility this Delay may be as painful to
  her as it is to me. If it be as much, it must be more, by reason of
  the severe Rules the Sex are under in being denied even the Relief of
  Complaint. If you oblige me in this, and I succeed, I promise you a
  Place at my Wedding, and a Treatment suitable to your Spectatorial
  Dignity.'<br>

<br>
  'I Yesterday heard a young Gentleman, that look'd as if he was just
  come to the Town, and a Scarf, upon Evil-speaking; which Subject, you
  know, Archbishop <i>Tillotson</i> has so nobly handled in a Sermon in his
  <i>Folio</i>. As soon as ever he had named his Text, and had opened a
  little the Drift of his Discourse, I was in great hopes he had been
  one of <b>Sir</b>  ROGER'S Chaplains. I have conceived so great an Idea of the
  charming Discourse above, that I should have thought one part of my
  Sabbath very well spent in hearing a Repetition of it. But alas! Mr.
  SPECTATOR, this Reverend Divine gave us his Grace's Sermon, and yet I
  don't know how; even I, that I am sure have read it at least twenty
  times, could not tell what to make of it, and was at a loss sometimes
  to guess what the Man aim'd at. He was so just indeed, as to give us
  all the Heads and the Sub-divisions of the Sermon; and farther I think
  there was not one beautiful Thought in it but what we had. But then,
  <b>Sir</b> , this Gentleman made so many pretty Additions; and he could never
  give us a Paragraph of the Sermon, but he introduced it with something
  which, methought, look'd more like a Design to shew his own Ingenuity,
  than to instruct the People. In short, he added and curtailed in such
  a manner that he vexed me; insomuch that I could not forbear thinking
  (what, I confess, I ought not to have thought of in so holy a Place)

  <i>Mr.</i> SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'There is no Part of your Writings which I have in more Esteem than
  your Criticism upon <i>Milton</i>. It is an honourable and candid Endeavour
  to set the Works of our Noble Writers in the graceful Light which they
  deserve. You will lose much of my kind Inclination towards you, if you
  do not attempt the Encomium of <i>Spencer</i> also, or at least indulge my
  Passion for that charming Author so far as to print the loose Hints I
  now give you on that Subject.<br>
<br>
  'Spencer's general Plan is the Representation of six Virtues,
  Holiness, Temperance, Chastity, Friendship, Justice and Courtesy, in
  six Legends by six Persons. The six Personages are supposed under
  proper Allegories suitable to their respective Characters, to do all
  that is necessary for the full Manifestation of the respective Virtues
  which they are to exert.<br>
<br>
  'These one might undertake to shew under the several Heads, are
  admirably drawn; no Images improper, and most surprizingly beautiful.
  The Red-cross Knight runs through the whole Steps of the Christian
  Life; <i>Guyon</i> does all that Temperance can possibly require;
  <i>Britomartis</i> (a Woman) observes the true Rules of unaffected
  Chastity; <i>Arthegal</i> is in every Respect of Life strictly and wisely
  just; <i>Calidore</i> is rightly courteous.<br>
<br>
  'In short, in <i>Fairy-Land</i>, where Knights Errant have a full Scope to
  range, and to do even what <i>Ariosto's</i> or <i>Orlando's</i> could not do in
  the World without breaking into Credibility, <i>Spencer's</i> Knights have,
  under those six Heads, given a full and a truly Poetical System of
  Christian, Public, and Low Life.<br>
<br>
  'His Legend of Friendship is more diffuse, and yet even there the
  Allegory is finely drawn, only the Heads various, one Knight could not
  there support all the Parts.<br>
<br>
  'To do honour to his Country, Prince <i>Arthur</i> is an Universal Hero; in
  Holiness, Temperance, Chastity, and Justice super-excellent. For the
  same Reason, and to compliment Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>, <i>Gloriana</i>, Queen of
  Fairies, whose Court was the Asylum of the Oppressed, represents that
  Glorious Queen. At her Commands all these Knights set forth, and only
  at her's the Red-cross Knight destroys the Dragon. <i>Guyon</i> overturns
  the Bower of Bliss, <i>Arthegal</i> (i. e. <i>Justice</i>) beats down <i>Geryoneo</i>
  (i. e. <i>Phil.</i> II. King of <i>Spain</i>) to rescue <i>Belge</i> (i. e.
  <i>Holland</i>) and he beats the <i>Grantorto</i> (the same <i>Philip</i> in another
  Light) to restore <i>Irena</i> (i. e. <i>Peace</i> to Europe.)<br>
<br>
  'Chastity being the first Female Virtue, <i>Britomartis</i> is a <i>Britain</i>;
  her Part is fine, though it requires Explication. His stile is very
  Poetical; no Puns, Affectations of Wit, forced Antitheses, or any of
  that low Tribe.<br>
<br>
  'His old Words are all true <i>English</i>, and numbers exquisite; and
  since of Words there is the <i>Multa Renascentur</i>, since they are all
  proper, such a Poem should not (any more than <i>Milton's</i>) subsist all
  of it of common ordinary Words. See Instances of Descriptions.<br>
<br>
  'Causeless Jealousy in <i>Britomartis</i>, V. 6, 14, in its Restlessness.

<blockquote><i>Like as a wayward Child whose sounder Sleep<br>
    Is broken with some fearful Dream's Affright,<br>
  With froward Will doth set himself to weep,<br>
    Ne can be stil'd for all his Nurse's Might,<br>
    But kicks, and squalls, and shrieks for fell Despight;<br>
  Now scratching her, and her loose Locks misusing,<br>
    Now seeking Darkness, and now seeking Light;<br>
  Then craving Suck, and then the Suck refusing:<br>
  Such was this Lady's Loves in her Love's fond accusing.</i></blockquote>

  Curiosity occasioned by Jealousy, upon occasion of her Lover's
  Absence. <i>Ibid, Stan</i>. 8, 9.

<blockquote><i>Then as she looked long, at last she spy'd<br>
  One coming towards her with hasty Speed,<br>
Well ween'd she then, e'er him she plain descry'd,<br>
  That it was one sent from her Love indeed;<br>
Whereat her Heart was fill'd with Hope and Dread,<br>
  Ne would she stay till he in Place could come,<br>
But ran to weet him forth to know his Tidings somme;<br>
  Even in the Door him meeting, she begun,<br>
And where is he, thy Lord, and how far hence?<br>
  Declare at once; and hath he lost or won?</i></blockquote>

<i>Care</i> and his <i>House</i> are described thus, IV. 6, 33, 34, 35.<br>

<br>

My Friend the <i>Templar</i>, whom I have so often mentioned in these
Writings, having determined to lay aside his Poetical Studies, in order
to a closer Pursuit of the Law, <a name="fr5411">has</a> put together, as a Farewell Essay,
some Thoughts concerning <span style="color: #663300;"><i>Pronunciation</i> and <i>Action</i>,</span><a href="#f5411"><sup>1</sup></a> which he has
given me leave to communicate to the Publick. They are chiefly collected
from his Favourite Author, <i>Cicero</i>, who is known to have been an
intimate Friend of <i>Rostius</i> the Actor, <a name="fr5412">and</a> a good Judge of <span style="color: #663300;">Dramatick</span><a href="#f5412"><sup>2</sup></a> Performances, as well as the most Eloquent Pleader of the Time in
which he lived.<br>
<br>
Cicero concludes his celebrated Books <i>de Oratore</i> with some Precepts
for Pronunciation and Action, without which Part he affirms that the
best Orator in the World can never succeed; and an indifferent one, who
is Master of this, shall gain much greater Applause. What could make a
stronger Impression, says he, than those Exclamations of <i>Gracchus</i>:

<blockquote><i>Whither shall I turn? Wretch that I am! To what Place betake my self?
  Shall I go to the</i> Capitol?&mdash;<i>Alas! it is overflowed with my Brother's
  Blood. Or shall I retire to my House? Yet there I behold my Mother
  plung'd in Misery, weeping and despairing!</i></blockquote>

These Breaks and Turns of Passion, it seems, were so enforced by the
Eyes, Voice, and Gesture of the Speaker, that his very Enemies could not
refrain from Tears. I insist, says <i>Tully</i>, upon this the rather,
because our Orators, who are as it were Actors of the Truth it self,
have quitted this manner of speaking; and the Players, who are but the
Imitators of Truth, have taken it up.<br>
<br>
I shall therefore pursue the Hint he has here given me, and for the
Service of the <i>British Stage</i> I shall copy some of the Rules which this
great <i>Roman</i> Master has laid down; yet, without confining my self
wholly to his Thoughts or Words: and to adapt this Essay the more to the
Purpose for which I intend it, instead of the Examples he has inserted
in his Discourse, out of the ancient Tragedies, I shall make use of
parallel Passages out of the most celebrated of our own.<br>
<br>
The Design of Art is to assist Action as much as possible in the
Representation of Nature; for the Appearance of Reality is that which
moves us in all Representations, and these have always the greater
Force, the nearer they approach to Nature, and the less they shew of
Imitation.<br>
<br>
Nature herself has assigned to every Emotion of the Soul, its peculiar
Cast of the Countenance, Tone of Voice, and Manner of Gesture; and the
whole Person, all the Features of the Face and Tones of the Voice,
answer, like Strings upon musical Instruments, to the Impressions made
on them by the Mind. Thus the Sounds of the Voice, according to the
various Touches which raise them, form themselves into an Acute or
Grave, Quick or Slow, Loud or Soft Tone. These too may be subdivided
into various kinds of Tones, as the gentle, the rough, the contracted,
the diffuse, the continued, the intermitted, the broken, abrupt,
winding, softned, or elevated. Every one of these may be employed with
Art and Judgment; and all supply the Actor, as Colours do the Painter,
with an expressive Variety.<br>
<br>
Anger exerts its peculiar Voice in an acute, raised, and hurrying sound.
The passionate Character of <i>King Lear</i>, as it is admirably drawn by
<i>Shakespear</i>, abounds with the strongest Instances of this kind.

<blockquote><i>&mdash;Death! Confusion!<br>
  Fiery!&mdash;what Quality?&mdash;why</i> Gloster! Gloster!<br>
  <i>I'd speak with the Duke of</i> Cornwall <i>and his Wife.<br>
  Are they informed of this? My Breath and Blood!<br>
  Fiery? the fiery Duke?&mdash;&amp;c.</i></blockquote>

Sorrow and Complaint demand a Voice quite different, flexible, slow,
interrupted, and modulated in a mournful Tone; as in that pathetical
Soliloquy of Cardinal <i>Wolsey</i> on his Fall.

<blockquote><i>Farewel!&mdash;a long Farewel to all my Greatness!<br>
This is the State of Man!&mdash;to-day he puts forth<br>
The tender Leaves of Hopes; to-morrow Blossoms,<br>
And bears his blushing Honours thick upon him,<br>
The third Day comes a Frost, a killing Frost,<br>
And when he thinks, good easie Man, full surely<br>
His Greatness is a ripening, nips his Root,<br>
And then he falls as I do.</i></blockquote>

We have likewise a fine Example of this in the whole Part of
<i>Andromache</i> in the <i>Distrest-Mother</i>, particularly in these Lines.

<blockquote><i>I'll go, and in the Anguish of my Heart<br>
Weep o'er my Child&mdash;If he must die, my Life<br>
Is wrapt in his, I shall not long survive.<br>
'Tis for his sake that I have suffer'd Life,<br>
Groan'd in Captivity, and out-liv'd Hector.<br>
Yes, my</i> Astyanax, <i>we'll go together!<br>
Together to the Realms of Night we'll go;<br>
There to thy ravish'd Eyes thy <b>Sir</b> e I'll show,<br>
And point him out among the Shades below.</i></blockquote>

Fear expresses it self in a low, hesitating and abject Sound. If the
Reader considers the following Speech of <i>Lady Macbeth</i>, while her
husband is about the Murder of <i>Duncan</i> and his Grooms, he will imagine
her even affrighted with the Sound of her own Voice, while she is
speaking it.

<blockquote><i>Alas! I am afraid they have awak'd,<br>
And 'tis not done; th' Attempt, and not the Deed,<br>
Confounds us&mdash;Hark!&mdash;I laid the Daggers ready,<br>
He could not miss them. Had he not resembled<br>
My Father as he slept, I had done it.</i></blockquote>

Courage <a name="fr5413">assumes</a> a louder tone, as in that Speech of Don <i>Sebastian</i><a href="#f5413"><sup>3</sup></a>.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Here satiate all your Fury:<br>
Let Fortune empty her whole Quiver on me,<br>
I have a Soul that like an ample Shield<br>
Can take in all, and Verge enough for more.</i></blockquote>

Pleasure <a name="fr5414">dissolves</a> into a luxurious, mild, tender, and joyous
Modulation; as in the following Lines in <i>Caius Marius</i><a href="#f5414"><sup>4</sup></a>.

<blockquote>Lavinia! <i>O there's Musick in the Name,<br>
That softning me to infant Tenderness,<br>
Makes my Heart spring, like the first Leaps of Life.</i></blockquote>

And Perplexity is different from all these; grave, but not bemoaning,
with an earnest uniform Sound of Voice; as in that celebrated Speech of
<i>Hamlet</i>.

<blockquote><i>To be, or not to be?&mdash;that is the Question:<br>
Whether 'tis nobler in the Mind to suffer<br>
The Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune,<br>
Or to take Arms against a Sea of Troubles,<br>
And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep;<br>
No more; and by a Sleep to say we end<br>
The Heart-ach, and the thousand natural Shocks<br>
That Flesh is Heir to; 'tis a Consummation<br>
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep&mdash;<br>
To sleep; perchance to dream! Ay, there's the Rub.<br>
For in that sleep of Death what Dreams may come,<br>
When we have shuffled off this Mortal Coil,<br>
Must give us pause&mdash;There's the Respect<br>
That makes Calamity of so long Life;<br>
For who would bear the Whips and Scorns of Time,<br>
Th' Oppressor's Wrongs, the proud Man's contumely,<br>
The Pangs of despis'd Love, the Law's Delay,<br>
The Insolence of Office, and the Spurns<br>
That patient Merit of th' unworthy takes,<br>
When he himself might his Quietus make<br>
With a bare Bodkin? Who would Fardles bear,<br>
To groan and sweat under a weary Life?<br>
But that the Dread of something after Death,<br>
The undiscover'd Country, from whose Bourn<br>
No Traveller returns, puzzles the Will,<br>
And makes us rather chuse those Ills we have,<br>
Than fly to others that&mdash;we know not of.</i></blockquote>

As all these Varieties of Voice are to be directed by the Sense, so the
Action is to be directed by the Voice, and with a beautiful Propriety,
as it were to enforce it. The Arm, which by a strong Figure <i>Tully</i>
calls <i>The Orator's Weapon</i>, is to be sometimes raised and extended; and
the Hand, by its Motion, sometimes to lead, and sometimes to follow the
Words, as they are uttered. The Stamping of the Foot too has its proper
Expression in Contention, Anger, or absolute Command. But the Face is
the Epitome of the whole Man, and the Eyes are as it were the Epitome of
the Face; for which Reason, he says, the best Judges among the <i>Romans</i>
were not extremely pleased, even with <i>Roscius</i> himself in his Masque.
No Part of the Body, besides the Face, is capable of as many Changes as
there are different Emotions in the Mind, and of expressing them all by
those Changes. Nor is this to be done without the Freedom of the Eyes;
therefore <i>Theophrastus</i> call'd one, who barely rehearsed his Speech
with his Eyes fix'd, an <i>absent Actor</i>.<br>
<br>
As the Countenance admits of so great Variety, it requires also great
Judgment to govern it. Not that the Form of the Face is to be shifted on
every Occasion, lest it turn to Farce and Buffoonery; but it is certain
that the Eyes have a wonderful Power of marking the Emotions of the
Mind, sometimes by a stedfast Look, sometimes by a careless one, now by
a sudden Regard, then by a joyful Sparkling, as the Sense of the Words
is diversified: for Action is, as it were, the Speech of the Features
and Limbs, and must therefore conform itself always to the Sentiments of
the Soul. And it may be observed, that in all which relates to the
Gesture, there is a wonderful Force implanted by Nature, since the
Vulgar, the Unskilful, and even the most Barbarous are chiefly affected
by this. None are moved by the Sound of Words, but those who understand
the Language; and the Sense of many things is lost upon Men of a dull
Apprehension: but Action is a kind of Universal Tongue; all Men are
subject to the same Passions, and consequently know the same Marks of
them in others, by which they themselves express them.<br>
<br>
Perhaps some of my Readers may be of Opinion, that the Hints I have here
made use of, out of <i>Cicero</i>, are somewhat too refined for the Players
on our Theatre: In answer to which, I venture to lay it down as a Maxim,
that without Good Sense no one can be a good Player, and that he is very
unfit to personate the Dignity of a <i>Roman</i> Hero, who cannot enter into
the Rules for Pronunciation and Gesture delivered by a <i>Roman</i> Orator.<br>
<br>
There is another thing which my Author does not think too minute to
insist on, though it is purely mechanical: and that is the right
<i>pitching</i> of the Voice. On this occasion he tells the Story of
<i>Gracchus</i>, who employed a Servant with a little Ivory Pipe to stand
behind him, and give him the right Pitch, as often as he wandered too
far from the proper <a name="fr5415">Modulation</a>. Every Voice, says <i>Tully</i><a href="#f5415"><sup>5</sup></a>, has its
particular Medium and Compass, and the Sweetness of Speech consists in
leading it through all the Variety of Tones naturally, and without
touching any Extreme. Therefore, says he, 

<blockquote>  Leave the Pipe at home, but carry the Sense of this Custom with you.

<br>

When I have been present in Assemblies where my Paper has been talked
of, I have been very well pleased to hear those who would detract from
the Author of it observe, that the Letters which are sent to the
<i>Spectator</i> are as good, if not better than any of his Works. Upon this
Occasion many Letters of Mirth are usually mentioned, which some think
the <i>Spectator</i> writ to himself, and which others commend because they
fancy he received them from his Correspondents: Such are those from the
<i>Valetudinarian;</i> the Inspector of the Sign-Posts; the Master of the
Fan-Exercise: with that of the Hoop'd Petticoat; that of <i>Nicholas Hart</i>
the annual Sleeper; that from <b>Sir</b>  <i>John Envill;</i> that upon the <i>London</i>
Cries; with multitudes of the same nature. As I love nothing more than
to mortify the Ill-natured, that I may do it effectually, I must
acquaint them, they have very often praised me when they did not design
it, and that they have approved my Writings when they thought they had
derogated from them. I have heard several of these unhappy Gentlemen
proving, by undeniable Arguments, that I was not able to pen a Letter
which I had written the Day before. Nay, I have heard some of them
throwing out ambiguous Expressions, and giving the Company reason to
suspect that they themselves did me the Honour to send me such or such a
particular Epistle, which happened to be talked of with the Esteem or
Approbation of those who were present. These rigid Criticks are so
afraid of allowing me any thing which does not belong to me, that they
will not be positive whether the Lion, the wild Boar, and the
Flower-pots in the Play-house, did not actually write those Letters
which came to me in their Names. I must therefore inform these
Gentlemen, that I often chuse this way of casting my Thoughts into a
Letter, for the following Reasons; First, out of the Policy of those who
try their Jest upon another, before they own it themselves. Secondly,
because I would extort a little Praise from such who will never applaud
any thing whose Author is known and certain. Thirdly, because it gave me
an Opportunity of introducing a great variety of Characters into my
Work, which could not have been done, had I always written in the Person
of the <i>Spectator</i>. Fourthly, because the Dignity Spectatorial would
have suffered, had I published as from my self those several ludicrous
Compositions which I have ascribed to fictitious Names and Characters.
And lastly, because they often serve to bring in, more naturally, such
additional Reflections as have been placed at the End of them.<br>
<br>
There are others who have likewise done me a very particular Honour,
though undesignedly. These are such who will needs have it, that I have
translated or borrowed many of my Thoughts out of Books which are
written in other Languages. I have heard of a Person, who is more famous
for his Library than his Learning, that has asserted this more than once
in his private Conversation. Were it true, I am sure he could not speak
it from his own Knowledge; but had he read the Books which he has
collected, he would find this Accusation to be wholly groundless. Those
who are truly learned will acquit me in this Point, in which I have been
so far from offending, that I have been scrupulous perhaps to a Fault in
quoting the Authors of several Passages which I might have made my own.
But as this Assertion is in reality an Encomium on what I have
published, I ought rather to glory in it, than endeavour to confute it.<br>
<br>
Some are so very willing to alienate from me that small Reputation which
might accrue to me from any of these my Speculations, that they
attribute some of the best of them to those imaginary Manuscripts with
which I have introduced them. There are others, I must confess, whose
Objections have given me a greater Concern, as they seem to reflect,
under this Head, rather on my Morality than on my Invention. These are
they who say an Author is guilty of Falshood, when he talks to the
Publick of Manuscripts which he never saw, or describes Scenes of Action
or Discourse in which he was never engaged. But these Gentlemen would do
well to consider, there is not a Fable or Parable which ever was made
use of, that is not liable to this Exception; since nothing; according
to this Notion, can be related innocently, which was not once Matter of
Fact. Besides, I think the most ordinary Reader may be able to discover,
by my way of writing, what I deliver in these Occurrences as Truth, and
what as Fiction.<br>
<br>
Since I am unawares engaged in answering the several Objections which
have been made against these my Works, I must take Notice that there are
some who affirm a Paper of this Nature should always turn upon diverting
Subjects, and others who find Fault with every one of them that hath not
an immediate Tendency to the Advancement of Religion or Learning. I
shall leave these Gentlemen to dispute it out among themselves; since I
see one half of my Conduct patronized by each side. Were I serious on an
improper Subject, or trifling in a serious one, I should deservedly draw
upon me the Censure of my Readers; or were I conscious of any thing in
my Writings that is not innocent at least, or that the greatest part of
them were not sincerely designed to discountenance Vice and Ignorance,
and support the Interest of true Wisdom and Virtue, I should be more
severe upon my self than the Publick is disposed to be. In the mean
while I de<b>Sir</b> e my Reader to consider every particular Paper or Discourse
as a distinct Tract by itself, and independent of every thing that goes
before or after it.<br>
<br>
I shall end this Paper with the following Letter, which was really sent
me, as some others have been which I have published, and for which I
must own my self indebted to their respective Writers.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <b>Sir</b> ,<br>
<br>
  I was this Morning in a Company of your Well-wishers, when we read
  over, with great Satisfaction, <i>Tully's</i> Observations on Action
  adapted to the <i>British</i> Theatre: Though, by the way, we were very
  sorry to find that you have disposed of another Member of your Club.
  Poor <b>Sir</b>  <i>Roger</i> is dead, and the worthy Clergyman dying. Captain
  <i>Sentry</i> has taken Possession of a fair Estate; <i>Will. Honeycomb</i> has
  married a Farmer's Daughter; and the <i>Templar</i> withdraws himself into
  the Business of his own Profession. What will all this end in? We are
  afraid it portends no Good to the Publick. Unless you very speedily
  fix a Day for the Election of new Members, we are under Apprehensions
  of losing the <i>British Spectator</i>. I hear of a Party of Ladies who
  intend to address you on this Subject, and question not, if you do not
  give us the Slip very suddenly, that you will receive Addresses from
  all Parts of the Kingdom to continue so useful a Work. Pray deliver us
  out of this Perplexity, and among the Multitude of your Readers you
  will particularly oblige<br>
<br>
  <i>Your most Sincere Friend and Servant,</i><br>

Those who were skillful in Anatomy among the Ancients, concluded from
the outward and inward Make of an Human Body, that it was the Work of a
Being transcendently Wise and Powerful. As the World grew more
enlightened in this Art, their Discoveries gave them fresh Opportunities
of admiring the Conduct of Providence in the Formation of an Human Body.
<i>Galen</i> was converted by his Dissections, and could not but own a
Supreme Being upon a Survey of this his Handy-work. There were, indeed,
many Parts of which the old Anatomists did not know the certain Use; but
as they saw that most of those which they examined were adapted with
admirable Art to their several Functions, they did not question but
those, whose Uses they could not determine, were contrived with the same
Wisdom for respective Ends and Purposes. Since the Circulation of the
Blood has been found out, and many other great Discoveries have been
made by our modern Anatomists, we see new Wonders in the Human Frame,
and discern several important Uses for those Parts, which Uses the
Ancients knew nothing of. In short, the Body of Man is such a Subject as
stands the utmost Test of Examination. Though it appears formed with the
nicest Wisdom, upon the most superficial Survey of it, it still mends
upon the Search, and produces our Surprize and Amazement in proportion
as we pry into it. What I have here said of an Human Body, may be
applied to the Body of every Animal which has been the Subject of
Anatomical Observations.<br>
<br>
The Body of an Animal is an Object adequate to our Senses. It is a
particular System of Providence, that lies in a narrow Compass. The Eye
is able to command it, and by successive Enquiries can search into all
its Parts. Could the Body of the whole Earth, or indeed the whole
Universe, be thus submitted to the Examination of our Senses, were it
not too big and disproportioned for our Enquiries, too unwieldy for the
Management of the Eye and Hand, there is no question but it would appear
to us as curious and well-contrived a Frame as that of an Human Body. We
should see the same Concatenation and Subserviency, the same Necessity
and Usefulness, the same Beauty and Harmony in all and every of its
Parts, as what we discover in the Body of every single Animal.<br>
<br>
The more extended our Reason is, and the more able to grapple with
immense Objects, the greater still are those Discoveries which it makes
of Wisdom and Providence in the Work of the Creation. A <b>Sir</b>  <i>Isaac
Newton</i>, who stands up as the Miracle of the Present Age, can look
through a whole Planetary System; consider it in its Weight, Number, and
Measure; and draw from it as many Demonstrations of infinite Power and
Wisdom, as a more confined Understanding is able to deduce from the
System of an Human Body.<br>
<br>
But to return to our Speculations on Anatomy. I shall here consider the
Fabrick and Texture of the Bodies of Animals in one particular View;
which, in my Opinion, shews the Hand of a thinking and all-wise Being in
their Formation, with the Evidence of a thousand Demonstrations. I think
we may lay this down as an incontested Principle, that Chance never acts
in a perpetual Uniformity and Consistence with it self. If one should
always fling the same number with ten thousand Dice, or see every Throw
just five times less, or five times more in Number than the Throw which
immediately preceded it, who would not imagine there is some invisible
Power which directs the Cast? This is the Proceeding which we find in
the Operations of Nature. Every kind of Animal is diversified by
different Magnitudes, each of which gives rise to a different Species.
Let a Man trace the Dog or Lion-Kind, and he will observe how many of
the Works of Nature are published, if I may use the Expression, in a
variety of Editions. If we look into the Reptile World, or into those
different Kinds of Animals that fill the Element of Water, we meet with
the same Repetitions among several Species, that differ very little from
one another, but in Size and Bulk. You find the same Creature that is
drawn at large, copied out in several Proportions, and ending in
Miniature. It would be tedious to produce Instances of this regular
Conduct in Providence, as it would be superfluous to those who are
versed in the natural History of Animals. The magnificent Harmony of the
Universe is such, that we may observe innumerable <i>Divisions</i> running
upon the same <i>Ground</i>. I might also extend this Speculation to the dead
Parts of Nature, in which we may find Matter disposed into many
<i>similar</i> Systems, as well in our Survey of Stars and Planets, as of
Stones, Vegetables, and other sublunary Parts of the Creation. In a
Word, Providence has shewn the Richness of its Goodness and Wisdom, not
only in the Production of many Original Species, but in the Multiplicity
of Descants which it has made on every Original Species in particular.<br>
<br>
But to pursue this Thought still farther; Every living Creature,
considered in it self, has many very complicated Parts, that are exact
copies of some other Parts which it possesses, and which are complicated
in the same Manner. One <i>Eye</i> would have been sufficient for the
Subsistence and Preservation of an Animal; but in order to better his
Condition, we see another placed with a Mathematical Exactness in the
same most advantageous Situation, and in every particular of the same
Size and Texture. Is it possible for Chance to be thus delicate and
uniform in her Operations? Should a Million of Dice turn up twice
together the same Number, the Wonder would be nothing in comparison with
this. But when we see this Similitude and Resemblance in the Arm, the
Hand, the Fingers; when we see one half of the Body entirely correspond
with the other in all those minute Strokes, without which a Man might
have very well subsisted; nay, when we often see a single Part repeated
an hundred times in the same Body, notwithstanding it consists of the
most intricate weaving of numberless Fibres, and these Parts differing
still in Magnitude, as the Convenience of their particular Situation
requires; sure a Man must have a strange Cast of Understanding, who does
not discover the Finger of God in so wonderful a Work. These Duplicates
in those Parts of the Body, without which a Man might have very well
subsisted, though not so well as with them, are a plain Demonstration of
an all-wise Contriver; as those more numerous Copyings, which are found
among the Vessels of the same Body, are evident Demonstrations that they
could not be the Work of Chance. This Argument receives additional
Strength, if we apply it to every Animal and Insect within our
Knowledge, as well as to those numberless living Creatures that are
Objects too minute for a Human Eye; and if we consider how the several
Species in this whole World of Life resemble one another in very many
Particulars, so far as is convenient for their respective States of
Existence; it is much more probable that an hundred Million of Dice
should be casually thrown a hundred Million of Times in the same number,
than that the Body of any single Animal should be produced by the
fortuitous Concourse of Matter. And that the like Chance should arise in
innumerable Instances, requires a degree of Credulity that is not under
the direction of Common Sense. <span style="color: #663300;">We may carry this Consideration yet
further, if we reflect on the two Sexes in every living Species, with
their Resemblances to each other, and those particular Distinctions that
were necessary for the keeping up of this great World of Life.</span><br>
<br>
There are many more Demonstrations of a Supreme Being, and of his
transcendent Wisdom, Power, and Goodness in the Formation of the Body of
a living Creature, <a name="fr5431">for</a> which I refer my Reader to other Writings,
particularly to the Sixth Book of the Poem, entitled <i>Creation</i><a href="#f5431"><sup>1</sup></a>, where
the Anatomy of the human Body is described with great Perspicuity and
Elegance. I have been particular on the Thought which runs through this
Speculation, because I have not seen it enlarged upon by others.<br>

There are, I think, Sentiments in the following Letter from my Friend
Captain <b>Sentry</b>, which discover a rational and equal Frame of Mind, as
well prepared for an advantageous as an unfortunate Change of Condition.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <i>Coverley-Hall, Nov.</i> 15, <i>Worcestershire</i>.<br>
<br>
  <i><b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  'I am come to the Succession of the Estate of my honoured Kinsman <b>Sir</b> 
  <b>Roger De Coverley</b>; and I assure you I find it no easy Task to keep up
  the Figure of Master of the Fortune which was so handsomely enjoyed by
  that honest plain Man. I cannot (with respect to the great Obligations
  I have, be it spoken) reflect upon his Character, but I am confirmed
  in the Truth which I have, I think, heard spoken at the Club, to wit,
  That a Man of a warm and well-disposed Heart with a very small
  Capacity, is highly superior in human Society to him who with the
  greatest Talents is cold and languid in his Affections. But, alas! why
  do I make a difficulty in speaking of my worthy Ancestor's Failings?
  His little Absurdities and Incapacity for the Conversation of the
  politest Men are dead with him, and his greater Qualities are even now
  useful to him. I know not whether by naming those Disabilities I do
  not enhance his Merit, since he has left behind him a Reputation in
  his Country which would be worth the Pains of the wisest Man's whole
  Life to arrive at. By the way I must observe to you, that many of your
  Readers have mistook that Passage in your Writings, wherein <b>Sir</b>  <b>Roger</b>
  is reported to have enquired into the private Character of the young
  Woman at the Tavern. I know you mentioned that Circumstance as an
  Instance of the Simplicity and Innocence of his Mind, which made him
  imagine it a very easy thing to reclaim one of those Criminals, and
  not as an Inclination in him to be guilty with her. The less
  discerning of your Readers cannot enter into that Delicacy of
  Description in the Character: But indeed my chief Business at this
  time is to represent to you my present State of Mind, and the
  Satisfactions I promise to my self in the Possession of my new
  Fortune. I have continued all <b>Sir</b>  <b>Roger's</b> Servants, except such as it
  was a Relief to dismiss into little Beings within my Manor: Those who
  are in a List of the good Knight's own Hand to be taken care of by me,
  I have quartered upon such as have taken new Leases of me, and added
  so many Advantages during the Lives of the Persons so quartered, that
  it is the Interest of those whom they are joined with, to cherish and
  befriend them upon all Occasions. I find a considerable Sum of ready
  Money, which I am laying out among my Dependants at the common
  Interest, but with a Design to lend it according to their Merit,
  rather than according to their Ability. I shall lay a Tax upon such as
  I have highly obliged, to become Security to me for such of their own
  poor Youth, whether Male or Female, as want Help towards getting into
  some Being in the World. I hope I shall be able to manage my Affairs
  so, as to improve my Fortune every Year, by doing Acts of Kindness. I
  will lend my Money to the Use of none but indigent Men, secured by
  such as have ceased to be indigent by the Favour of my Family or my
  self. What makes this the more practicable, is, that if they will do
  any one Good with my Money, they are welcome to it upon their own
  Security: And I make no Exception against it, because the Persons who
  enter into the Obligations, do it for their own Family. I have laid
  out four thousand Pounds this way, and it is not to be imagined what a
  Crowd of People are obliged by it. In Cases where <b>Sir</b>  <b>Roger</b> has
  recommended, I have lent Money to put out Children, with a Clause
  which makes void the Obligation, in case the Infant dies before he is
  out of his Apprenticeship; by which means the Kindred and Masters are
  extremely careful of breeding him to Industry, that he may repay it
  himself by his Labour, in three Years Journeywork after his Time is
  out, for the Use of his Securities. Opportunities of this kind are all
  that have occurred since I came to my Estate; but I assure you I will
  preserve a constant Disposition to catch at all the Occasions I can to
  promote the Good and Happiness of my Neighbourhood.<br>
<br>
  'But give me leave to lay before you a little Establishment which has
  grown out of my past Life, that I doubt not, will administer great
  Satisfaction to me in that Part of it, whatever that is, which is to
  come.<br>
<br>
  'There is a Prejudice in favour of the Way of Life to which a Man has
  been educated, which I know not whether it would not be faulty to
  overcome: It is like a Partiality to the Interest of one's own Country
  before that of any other Nation. It is from an Habit of Thinking,
  grown upon me from my Youth spent in Arms, that I have ever held
  Gentlemen, who have preserved Modesty, Good-nature, Justice, and
  Humanity in a Soldier's Life, to be the most valuable and worthy
  Persons of the human Race. To pass through imminent Dangers, suffer
  painful Watchings, frightful Alarms, and laborious Marches for the
  greater part of a Man's Time, and pass the rest in a Sobriety
  conformable to the Rules of the most virtuous civil Life, is a Merit
  too great to deserve the Treatment it usually meets with among the
  other part of the World. But I assure you, <b>Sir</b> , were there not very
  many who have this Worth, we could never have seen the glorious Events
  which we have in our Days. I need not say more to illustrate the
  Character of a Soldier, than to tell you he is the very contrary to
  him you observe loud, sawcy, and over-bearing in a red Coat about
  Town. But I was going to tell you, that in Honour of the Profession of
  Arms, I have set apart a certain Sum of Money for a Table for such
  Gentlemen as have served their Country in the Army, and will please
  from Time to Time to sojourn all, or any Part of the Year, at
  <i>Coverley</i>. Such of them as will do me that Honour, shall find Horses,
  Servants, and all things necessary for their Accommodation and
  Enjoyment of all the Conveniences of Life in a pleasant various
  Country. If Colonel <i>Camperfelt</i> be in Town, and his Abilities are not
  employ'd another way in the Service, there is no Man would be more
  welcome here. That Gentleman's thorough Knowledge in his Profession,
  together with the Simplicity of his Manners, and Goodness of his
  Heart, would induce others like him to honour my Abode; and I should
  be glad my Acquaintance would take themselves to be invited or not, as
  their Characters have an Affinity to his.<br>
<br>
  'I would have all my Friends know, that they need not fear (though I
  am become a Country Gentleman) I will trespass against their
  Temperance and Sobriety. No, <b>Sir</b> , I shall retain so much of the good
  Sentiments for the Conduct of Life, which we cultivated in each other
  at our Club, as to contemn all inordinate Pleasures: But particularly
  remember, with our beloved <i>Tully</i>, that the Delight in Food consists
  in De<b>Sir</b> e, not Satiety. They who most passionately pursue Pleasure,
  seldomest arrive at it. Now I am writing to a Philosopher, I cannot
  forbear mentioning the Satisfaction I took in the Passage I read
  Yesterday in the same <i>Tully</i>. A Nobleman of <i>Athens</i> made a
  Compliment to <i>Plato</i> the Morning after he had supped at his House,
  <i>Your Entertainments do not only please when you give them, but also
  the Day after</i>.<br>
<br>
  <i>I am, My worthy Friend,<br>
<br>
  Your most obedient humble Servant,</i><br>

I cannot but think the following Letter from the Emperor of <i>China</i> to
the Pope of <i>Rome</i>, proposing a Coalition of the <i>Chinese</i> and <i>Roman</i>
Churches, will be acceptable to the Curious. I must confess I my self
being of opinion that the Emperor has as much Authority to be
Interpreter to him he pretends to expound, as the Pope has to be Vicar
to the Sacred Person he takes upon him to represent, I was not a little
pleased with their Treaty of Alliance. What Progress the Negotiation
between his Majesty of <i>Rome</i>, and his Holiness of <i>China</i> makes (as we
daily Writers say upon Subjects where we are at a Loss) Time will let us
know. In the mean time, since they agree in the Fundamentals of Power
and Authority, and differ only in Matters of Faith, we may expect the
Matter will go on without Difficulty.<br>

  A Letter from the Emperor of <i>China</i> to the Pope, interpreted by a
  Father Jesuit, Secretary to the <i>Indies</i>.<br>
<br>
  <i>To you blessed above the Blessed, great Emperor of Bishops, and
  Pastor of Christians, Dispenser of the Oil of the Kings of Europe</i>,
  Clement XI.<br>
<br>
  "The Favourite Friend of God <i>Gionnata</i> the VIIth, most Powerful above
  the most Powerful of the Earth, Highest above the Highest under the
  Sun and Moon, who sits on a Throne of Emerald of <i>China</i>, above 100
  Steps of Gold, to interpret the Language of God to the faithful, and
  who gives Life and Death to 115 Kingdoms, and 170 Islands; he writes
  with the Quill of a Virgin <i>Ostrich</i>, and sends Health and Increase of
  old Age.<br>
<br>
  "Being arrived at the time of our Age, in which the Flower of our
  Royal Youth ought to ripen into Fruit towards old Age, to comfort
  therewith the De<b>Sir</b> e of our devoted People, and to propagate the Seed
  of that Plant which must protect them; We have determined to accompany
  our selves with an high Amorous Virgin, suckled at the Breast of a
  wild Lioness, and a meek Lamb; and imagining with our selves that your
  <i>European Roman</i> People is the Father of many unconquerable and chaste
  Ladies: We stretch out our powerful Arm to embrace one of them, and
  she shall be one of your Neices, or the Neice of some other great
  <i>Latin</i> Priest, the Darling of God's Right Eye. Let the Authority of
  <i>Sarah</i> be sown in her, the Fidelity of <i>Esther</i>, and the Wisdom of
  <i>Abba</i>. We would have her Eye like that of a <i>Dove</i>, which may look
  upon Heaven and Earth, with the Mouth of a Shell-Fish to feed upon the
  Dew of the Morning; Her Age must not exceed 200 Courses of the Moon;
  let her Stature be equal to that of an Ear of green Corn, and her
  Girth a Handful.<br>
<br>
  "We will send our <i>Mandarine's</i> Embassadors to clothe her, and to
  conduct her to us, and we will meet her on the Bank of the great
  River, making her to leap up into our Chariot. She may with us worship
  her own God; together with twenty four Virgins of her own chusing; and
  she may sing with them, as the <i>Turtle</i> in the Spring. You, O Father
  and Friend, complying with this our De<b>Sir</b> e, maybe an occasion of
  uniting in perpetual Friendship our high Empire with your <i>European</i>
  Kingdoms, and we may embrace your Laws, as the <i>Ivy</i> embraces the
  Tree; and we our selves may scatter our Royal Blood into your
  Provinces, warming the chief of your Princes with the amorous Fire of
  our <i>Amazons</i>, the resembling Pictures of some of which our said
  <i>Mandarine's</i> Embassadors shall convey to you.<br>
<br>
  "We exhort you to keep in Peace two good Religious Families of
  <i>Missionaries</i>, the black Sons of <i>Ignatius</i>, and the white and black
  Sons of <i>Dominicus</i>; that the Counsel, both of the one and the other,
  may serve as a Guide to us in our Government, and a Light to interpret
  the Divine Law, as the Oil cast into the Sea produces Light.<br>
<br>
  "To conclude, we rising up in our Throne to embrace you, we declare
  you our Ally and Confederate; and have ordered this Leaf to be sealed
  with our Imperial Signet, in our Royal City the Head of the World, the
  8th Day of the third Lunation, and the 4th Year of our Reign."</blockquote><br>

Letters from <i>Rome</i> say, the whole Conversation both among Gentlemen and
Ladies has turned upon the Subject of this Epistle, ever since it
arrived. The Jesuit who translated it says, it loses much of the Majesty
of the Original in the <i>Italian</i>. It seems there was an Offer of the
same nature made by a Predecessor of the present Emperor to <i>Lewis</i> the
XIIIth of France, but no Lady of that Court would take the Voyage, that
Sex not being at that time so much used in politick Negotiations. The
manner of treating the Pope is, according to the <i>Chinese</i> Ceremonial,
very respectful: For the Emperor writes to him with the Quill of a
Virgin <i>Ostrich</i>, which was never used before but in Writing Prayers.
Instructions are preparing for the Lady who shall have so much Zeal as

<br>
It gives me very great Scandal to observe, where-ever I go, how much
Skill, in buying all manner of Goods, there is necessary to defend
yourself from being cheated in whatever you see exposed to Sale. My
Reading makes such a strong impression upon me, that I should think my
self a Cheat in my Way, if I should translate any thing from another
Tongue, and not acknowledge it to my Readers. I understood from common
Report, <a name="fr5461">that</a> Mr. <i>Cibber</i> was introducing a <i>French</i> Play upon our
Stage, and thought my self concerned to let the Town know what was his,
and what foreign<a href="#f5461"><sup>1</sup></a>. When I came to the Rehearsal, I found the House so
partial to one of their own Fraternity, that they gave every thing which
was said such Grace, Emphasis, and Force in their Action, that it was no
easy matter to make any Judgment of the Performance. Mrs. <i>Oldfield</i>,
who, it seems, is the Heroick Daughter, had so just a Conception of her
Part, that her Action made what she spoke appear decent, just, and
noble. The Passions of Terrour and Compassion, they made me believe were
very artfully raised, and the whole Conduct of the Play artful and
surprizing. We Authors do not much relish the Endeavours of Players in
this kind; but have the same Disdain as Physicians and Lawyers have when
Attorneys and Apothecaries give Advice. <i>Cibber</i> himself took the
liberty to tell me, that he expected I would do him Justice, and allow
the Play well-prepared for his <b>Spectators</b>, whatever it was for his
Readers. He added very many Particulars not uncurious concerning the
manner of taking an Audience, and laying wait not only for their
superficial Applause, but also for insinuating into their Affections and
Passions, by the artful Management of the Look, Voice, and Gesture of
the Speaker. I could not but consent that the Heroick Daughter appeared
in the Rehearsal a moving Entertainment wrought out of a great and
exemplary Virtue.<br>
<br>
The Advantages of Action, Show, and Dress on these Occasions are
allowable, because the Merit consists in being capable of imposing upon
us to our Advantage and Entertainment. All that I was going to say about
the Honesty of an Author in the Sale of his Ware, was that he ought to
own all that he had borrowed from others, and lay in a clear light all
that he gives his <b>Spectators</b> for their Money, with an Account of the
first Manufacturers. But I intended to give the Lecture of this Day upon
the common and prostituted Behaviour of Traders in ordinary Commerce.
The Philosopher made it a Rule of Trade, that your Profit ought to be
the common Profit; and it is unjust to make any Step towards Gain,
wherein the Gain of even those to whom you sell is not also consulted. A
Man may deceive himself if he thinks fit, but he is no better than a
Cheat who sells any thing without telling the Exceptions against it, as
well as what is to be said to its Advantage. The scandalous abuse of
Language and hardening of Conscience, which may be observed every Day in
going from one Place to another, is what makes a whole City to an
unprejudiced Eye a Den of Thieves. It was no small pleasure to me for
this reason to remark, as I passed by <i>Cornhill</i>, <a name="fr5462">that</a> the Shop of that
worthy, honest, tho' lately unfortunate, Citizen, Mr. <i>John Moreton</i><a href="#f5462"><sup>2</sup></a>, so well known in the Linnen Trade, is fitting up a-new. Since a Man
has been in a distressed Condition, it ought to be a great Satisfaction
to have passed thro' it in such a Manner as not to have lost the
Friendship of those who suffered with him, but to receive an honourable
Acknowledgment of his Honesty from those very Persons to whom the Law
had consigned his Estate.<br>
<br>
The Misfortune of this Citizen is like to prove of a very general
Advantage to those who shall deal with him hereafter: For the Stock with
which he now sets up being the Loan of his Friends, he cannot expose
that to the Hazard of giving Credit, but enters into a Ready-Money
Trade, by which Means he will both buy and sell the best and cheapest.
He imposes upon himself a Rule of affixing the Value of each Piece he
sells to the Piece it self; so that the most ignorant Servant or Child
will be as good a Buyer at his Shop as the most skilful in the Trade.
For all which, you have all his Hopes and Fortune for your Security. To
encourage Dealing after this Way, there is not only the avoiding the
most infamous Guilt in ordinary Bartering; but this Observation, That he
who buys with ready Money saves as much to his Family, as the State
exacts out of his Land for the Security and Service of his Country; that
is to say, in plain <i>English</i>, Sixteen will do as much as Twenty
Shillings.<br>

<blockquote>  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'My Heart is so swelled with grateful Sentiments on account of some
  Favours which I have lately received, that I must beg leave to give
  them Utterance amongst the Croud of other anonymous Correspondents;
  and writing, I hope, will be as great a Relief to my forced Silence,
  as it is to your natural Taciturnity&mdash;My generous Benefactor will not
  suffer me to speak to him in any Terms of Acknowledgment, but ever
  treats me as if he had the greatest Obligations, and uses me with a
  Distinction that is not to be expected from one so much my Superiour
  in Fortune, Years, and Understanding. He insinuates, as if I had a
  certain Right to his Favours from some Merit, which his particular
  Indulgence to me has discovered but that is only a beautiful Artifice
  to lessen the Pain an honest Mind feels in receiving Obligations, when
  there is no probability of returning them.<br>
<br>
  'A gift is doubled when accompanied with such a Delicacy of Address;
  but what to me gives it an inexpressible Value, is its coming from the
  Man I most esteem in the World. It pleases me indeed, as it is an
  Advantage and Addition to my Fortune; but when I consider it is an
  Instance of that good Man's Friendship, it overjoys, it transports me;
  I look on it with a Lover's Eye, and no longer regard the Gift, but
  the Hand that gave it. For my Friendship is so entirely void of any
  gainful Views, that it often gives me Pain to think it should have
  been chargeable to him; and I cannot at some melancholy Hours help
  doing his Generosity the Injury of fearing it should cool on this
  account, and that the last Favour might be a sort of Legacy of a
  departing Friendship.<br>
<br>
  'I Confess these Fears seem very groundless and unjust, but you must
  forgive them to the Apprehension of one possessed of a great Treasure,
  who is frighted at the most distant Shadow of Danger.<br>
<br>
  'Since I have thus far open'd my Heart to you, I will not conceal the
  secret Satisfaction I feel there of knowing the Goodness of my Friend
  will not be unrewarded. I am pleased with thinking the Providence of
  the Almighty hath sufficient Blessings in store for him, and will
  certainly discharge the Debt, though I am not made the happy
  Instrument of doing it.<br>
<br>
  'However, nothing in my power shall be wanting to shew my Gratitude; I
  will make it the Business of my Life to thank him, and shall esteem
  (next to him) those my best Friends, who give me greatest Assistance
  in this good Work. Printing this Letter would be some little Instance
  of my Gratitude; and your Favour herein will very much oblige<br>

<a name="f5461"><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote 1:</span></a> &nbsp; <i>Ximena</i>, or the <i>Heroic Daughter</i>, a Tragedy taken from
the <i>Cid</i> of Corneille, by Colley Gibber. The play was not published
until after Steele's pamphlet, <i>The Crisis,</i> had exposed him to
political and (as it necessarily followed in those days) personal
detraction. Cibber then dedicated his play to Steele, referring to the
custom of his calumniators, since they could not deny his literary
services, to transfer all the merit of them to Addison, upon whom he had
so generously heaped more than the half of his own fame, and said:

  <blockquote>"Your Enemies therefore, thus knowing that your own consent had partly
  justified their insinuations, saved a great deal of their malice from
  being ridiculous, and fairly left you to apply to such your singular
  conduct what Mark Antony says of Octavius in the play:

    <blockquote><i>'Fool that I was! upon my Eagle's wings<br>
    I bore this Wren, 'till I was tired with soaring,<br>
    And now, he mounts above me.'"</i></blockquote></blockquote>

True-hearted Steele never read his relation to his friend in this
fashion. With how fine a disregard of conventional dignity is the latter
part of this paper given by Steele to the kind effort to help in setting

It is very difficult to praise a Man without putting him out of

  generally descant upon your Speculations, or upon the Subjects on
  which you have treated. We were last <i>Tuesday</i> talking of those two
  Volumes which you have lately published. Some were commending one of
  your Papers, and some another; and there was scarce a single Person in
  the Company that had not a favourite Speculation. Upon this a Man of
  Wit and Learning told us, he thought it would not be amiss if we paid
  the <i>Spectator</i> <a name="fr5471">the</a> same Compliment that is often made in our publick
  Prints to <b>Sir</b>  <i>William Read</i>, Dr. <i>Grant</i>, Mr. <i>Moor</i> the Apothecary<a href="#f5471"><sup>1</sup></a>; and other eminent Physicians, where it is usual for the Patients
  to publish the Cures which have been made upon them, and the several
  Distempers under which they laboured. The Proposal took, and the Lady
  where we visited having the two last Volumes in large Paper
  interleav'd for her own private use, ordered them to be brought down,
  and laid in the Window, whither every one in the Company retired, and
  writ down a particular Advertisement in the Style and Phrase of the
  like ingenious Compositions which we frequently meet with at the end
  of our News-Papers. When we had finish'd our Work, we read them with a
  great deal of Mirth at the Fire-side, and agreed, <i>Nemine

  The Gentleman who made the Proposal enter'd the following
  Advertisement before the Title-Page, after which the rest succeeded in
  order.

    all Capacities; shewing how any Person may Cure himself of

  <i>Nov</i>. 27, 1712.<br>
<br>
  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'I have read this Day's Paper with a great deal of Pleasure, and could
  send you an Account of several Elixirs and Antidotes in your third
  Volume, which your Correspondents have not taken Notice of in their
  Advertisements; and at the same time must own to you, that I have
  seldom seen a Shop furnished with such a Variety of Medicaments, and
  in which there are fewer Soporifics. The several Vehicles you have
  invented for conveying your unacceptable Truths to us, are what I most
  particularly admire, as I am afraid they are Secrets which will die
  with you. I do not find that any of your Critical Essays are taken
  Notice of in this Paper, notwithstanding I look upon them to be
  excellent Cleansers of the Brain, and could venture to superscribe
  them with an Advertisement which I have lately seen in one of our
  News-Papers, wherein there is an Account given of a Sovereign Remedy
  for restoring the Taste of all such Persons whose Palates have been
  vitiated by Distempers, unwholesome Food, or any the like Occasions.
  But to let fall the Allusion, notwithstanding your Criticisms, and
  particularly the Candour which you have discovered in them, are not
  the least taking Part of your Works, I find your Opinion concerning
  <i>Poetical Justice</i>, as it is expressed in the first Part of your
  [Volume 1 link: <a href="../SV1/Spectator1.html#section40">Fortieth <i>Spectator</i></a>], is controverted by some eminent Criticks; and as
  you now seem, to our great Grief of Heart, to be winding up your
  Bottoms, I hoped you would have enlarged a little upon that Subject.
  It is indeed but a single Paragraph in your Works, and I believe those
  who have read it with the same Attention I have done, will think there
  is nothing to be objected against it. I have however drawn up some
  additional Arguments to strengthen the Opinion which you have there
  delivered, having endeavoured to go to the Bottom of that Matter,
  which you may either publish or suppress as you think fit.<br>
<br>
  '<i>Horace</i> in my Motto says, that all Men are vicious, and that they
  differ from one another, only as they are more or less so. <i>Boileau</i>
  has given the same Account of our Wisdom, as <i>Horace</i> has of our
  Virtue.

<blockquote><i>Tous les homines sont fous, et, malgr&eacute; tous leurs soins,<br>
Ne different entre eux, que du plus et du moins.</i></blockquote>

  'All Men, says he, are Fools, and, in spite of their Endeavours to the
  contrary, differ from one another only as they are more or less so.<br>
<br>
  'Two or three of the old <i>Greek</i> Poets have given the same turn to a
  Sentence which describes the Happiness of Man in this Life;

<blockquote><img src="images/SG11.gif" width="365" height="34" border="1" alt="Greek: T&ograve; zaen alyp&ocirc;s, andr&oacute;s esti eutuchous"></blockquote>

  'That Man is most happy who is the least miserable.<br>
<br>
  'It will not perhaps be unentertaining to the Polite Reader to observe
  how these three beautiful Sentences are formed upon different Subjects
  by the same way of thinking; but I shall return to the first of them.<br>
<br>
  'Our Goodness being of a comparative, and not an absolute nature,
  there is none who in strictness can be called a Virtuous Man. Every
  one has in him a natural Alloy, tho' one may be fuller of Dross than
  another: For this reason I cannot think it right to introduce a
  perfect or a faultless Man upon the Stage; not only because such a
  Character is improper to move Compassion, but because there is no such
  a thing in Nature. This might probably be one Reason why the SPECTATOR
  in one of his Papers took notice of that late invented Term called
  <i>Poetical Justice</i>, and the wrong Notions into which it has led some
  Tragick Writers. The most perfect Man has Vices enough to draw down
  Punishments upon his Head, and to justify Providence in regard to any
  Miseries that may befal him. For this reason I cannot think, but that
  the Instruction and Moral are much finer, where a Man who is virtuous
  in the main of his Character falls into Distress, and sinks under the
  Blows of Fortune at the End of a Tragedy, than when he is represented
  as Happy and Triumphant. Such an Example corrects the Insolence of
  Human Nature, softens the Mind of the Beholder with Sentiments of Pity
  and Compassion, comforts him under his own private Affliction, and
  teaches him not to judge Mens Virtues by their Successes. I cannot
  think of one real Hero in all Antiquity so far raised above Human
  Infirmities, that he might not be very naturally represented in a
  Tragedy as plunged in Misfortunes and Calamities. The Poet may still
  find out some prevailing Passion or Indiscretion in his Character, and
  shew it in such a Manner, as will sufficiently acquit the Gods of any
  Injustice in his Sufferings. For as <i>Horace</i> observes in my Text, the
  best Man is faulty, tho' not in so great a degree as those whom we
  generally call vicious Men.<br>
<br>
  'If such a strict Poetical Justice, as some Gentlemen insist upon, was
  to be observed in this Art, there is no manner of Reason why it should
  not extend to Heroick Poetry, as well as Tragedy. But we find it so
  little observed in <i>Homer</i>, that his <i>Achilles</i> is placed in the
  greatest point of Glory and Success, though his Character is Morally
  Vicious, and only Poetically Good, if I may use the Phrase of our
  modern Criticks. The <i>&AElig;neid</i> is filled with Innocent, unhappy Persons.
  <i>Nisus</i> and <i>Eurialus, Lausus</i> and <i>Pallas</i> come all to unfortunate
  Ends. The Poet takes Notice in particular, that in the Sacking of
  <i>Troy, Ripheus</i> fell, who was the most just Man among the <i>Trojans</i>.

<blockquote><i>&mdash;Cadit et Ripheus justissimus unus,<br>
Qui fuit in Teucris et servantissimus &AElig;qui:<br>
Dijs aliter visum est&mdash;</i></blockquote>

  'And that <i>Pantheus</i> could neither be preserved by his transcendent
  Piety, nor by the holy Fillets of <i>Apollo</i>, whose Priest he was.

<blockquote><i>&mdash;nec Te tua plurima Pantheu<br>

  'I might here mention the Practice of ancient Tragick Poets, both
  <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i>; but as this Particular is touched upon in the
  Paper above-mentioned, I shall pass it over in Silence. I could
  produce Passages out of <i>Aristotle</i> in favour of my Opinion, and if in
  one Place he says that an absolutely Virtuous Man should not be
  represented as unhappy, this does not justifie any one who shall think
  fit to bring in an absolutely virtuous Man upon the Stage. Those who
  are acquainted with that Author's Way of Writing, know very well, that
  to take the whole extent of his Subject into his Divisions of it, he
  often makes use of such Cases as are imaginary, and not reducible to
  Practice: He himself declares that such Tragedies as ended unhappily
  bore away the Prize in Theatrical Contentions, from those which ended
  happily; and for the   [Volume 1 link: <a href="../SV1/Spectator1.html#section40">Fortieth Speculation</a>], which I am now considering,
  as it has given Reasons why these are more apt to please an Audience,
  so it only proves that these are generally preferable to the other,
  tho' at the same time it affirms that many excellent Tragedies have
  and may be written in both kinds.<br>
<br>
  <span style="color: #663300;">'I shall conclude with observing, that though the <i>Spectator</i>
  above-mentioned is so far against the Rule of Poetical Justice, as to
  affirm, that good Men may meet with an unhappy Catastrophe in Tragedy,
  it does not say that ill Men may go off unpunished. The Reason for
  this Distinction is very plain, namely, because the best of Men are
  vicious enough to justify Providence for any Misfortunes and
  Afflictions which may befal them, but there are many Men so criminal
  that they can have no Claim or Pretence to Happiness. The best of Men
  may deserve Punishment, but the worst of Men cannot deserve
  Happiness.'</span>

I believe most People begin the World with a Resolution to withdraw from
it into a serious kind of Solitude or Retirement, when they have made
themselves easie in it. Our Unhappiness is, that we find out some Excuse
or other for deferring such our good Resolutions till our intended
Retreat is cut off by Death. But among all kinds of People there are
none who are so hard to part with the World, as those who are grown old
in the heaping up of Riches. Their Minds are so warped with their
constant Attention to Gain, that it is very difficult for them to give
their Souls another Bent, and convert them towards those Objects, which,
though they are proper for every Stage of Life, are so more especially
for the last. <i>Horace</i> describes an old Usurer as so charmed with the
Pleasures of a Country Life, that in order to make a Purchase he called
in all his Mony; but what was the Event of it? Why in a very few Days
after he put it out again. I am engaged in this Series of Thought by a
Discourse which I had last Week with my worthy Friend <b>Sir</b>  <b>Andrew
Freeport</b>, a Man of so much natural Eloquence, good Sense, and Probity of
Mind, that I always hear him with a particular Pleasure. As we were
sitting together, being the sole remaining Members of our Club, <b>Sir</b> 
<b>Andrew</b> gave me an Account of the many busie Scenes of Life in which he
had been engaged, and at the same time reckoned up to me abundance of
those lucky Hits, which at another time he would have called pieces of
good Fortune; but in the Temper of Mind he was then, he termed them
Mercies, Favours of Providence, and Blessings upon an honest Industry.
Now, says he, you must know my good Friend, I am so used to consider my
self as Creditor and Debtor, that I often state my Accounts after the
same manner with regard to Heaven and my own Soul. In this case, when I
look upon the Debtor-side, I find such innumerable Articles, that I want
Arithmetick to cast them up; but when I look upon the Creditor-side, I
find little more than blank Paper. Now though I am very well satisfied
that it is not in my power to ballance Accounts with my Maker, I am
resolved however to turn all my future Endeavours that way. You must not
therefore be surprized, my Friend, if you hear that I am betaking my
self to a more thoughtful kind of Life, and if I meet you no more in
this Place.<br>
<br>
I could not but approve so good a Resolution, notwithstanding the Loss I
shall suffer by it. <b>Sir</b>  <b>Andrew</b> has since explained himself to me more at
large in the following Letter, which is just come to my hands.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <i>Good Mr.</i> SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'Notwithstanding my Friends at the Club have always rallied me, when I
  have talked of retiring from Business, and repeated to me one of my
  own Sayings, <i>That a Merchant has never enough till he has got a
  little more</i>; I can now inform you, that there is one in the World who
  thinks he has enough, and is determined to pass the Remainder of his
  Life in the Enjoyment of what he has. You know me so well, that I need
  not tell you, I mean, by the Enjoyment of my Possessions, the making
  of them useful to the Publick. As the greatest part of my Estate has
  been hitherto of an unsteady and volatile nature, either tost upon
  Seas or fluctuating in Funds; it is now fixed and settled in
  Substantial Acres and Tenements. I have removed it from the
  Uncertainty of Stocks, Winds and Waves, and disposed of it in a
  considerable Purchase. This will give me great Opportunity of being
  charitable in my way, that is, in setting my poor Neighbours to Work,
  and giving them a comfortable Subsistence out of their own Industry.
  My Gardens, my Fish-ponds, my Arable and Pasture Grounds shall be my
  several Hospitals, or rather Work-houses, in which I propose to
  maintain a great many indigent Persons, who are now starving in my
  Neighbourhood. I have got a fine Spread of improveable Lands, and in
  my own Thoughts am already plowing up some of them, fencing others;
  planting Woods, and draining Marshes. In fine, as I have my share in
  the Surface of this Island, I am resolved to make it as beautiful a
  Spot as any in her Majesty's Dominions; at least there is not an Inch
  of it which shall not be cultivated to the best Advantage, and do its
  utmost for its Owner. As in my Mercantile Employment I so disposed of
  my Affairs, that from whatever Corner of the Compass the Wind blew, it
  was bringing home one or other of my Ships; I hope, as a Husbandman,
  to contrive it so, that not a Shower of Rain, or a Glimpse of
  Sunshine, shall fall upon my Estate without bettering some part of it,
  and contributing to the Products of the Season. You know it has been
  hitherto my Opinion of Life, that it is thrown away when it is not
  some way useful to others. But when I am riding out by my self, in the
  fresh Air on the open Heath that lies by my House, I find several
  other Thoughts growing up in me. I am now of opinion that a Man <span style="color: #663300;">of my
  Age</span> may find Business enough on himself, by setting his Mind in
  order, preparing it for another World, and reconciling it to the
  Thoughts of Death. I must therefore acquaint you, that besides those
  usual Methods of Charity, of which I have before spoken, I am at this
  very Instant finding out a convenient Place where I may build an
  Alms-house, which I intend to endow very handsomely, for a Dozen
  superannuated Husbandmen. It <a name="fr5491">will</a> be a great pleasure to me to say my
  Prayers twice a-day with Men of my own <span style="color: #663300;">Years</span><a href="#f5491"><sup>1</sup></a>, who all of them, as
  well as my self, may have their Thoughts taken up how they shall die,
  rather than how they shall live. I remember an excellent Saying that I
  learned at School, <i>Finis coronat opus</i>. You know best whether it be
  in <i>Virgil</i> or in <i>Horace</i>, it is my business to apply it. If your
  Affairs will permit you to take the Country Air with me sometimes, you
  shall find an Apartment fitted up for you, and shall be every day
  entertained with Beef or Mutton of my own feeding; Fish out of my own
  Ponds; and Fruit out of my own Garden<span style="color: #663300;">s</span>. You shall have free Egress
  and Regress about my House, without having any Questions asked you,
  and in a Word such an hearty Welcome as you may expect from<br>

<br>

Since the late Dissolution of the Club whereof I have often declared my
self a Member, there are very many Persons who by Letters, Petitions,
and Recommendations, put up for the next Election. At the same time I
must complain, that several indirect and underhand Practices have been
made use of upon this Occasion. A certain Country Gentleman begun to
<i>tapp</i> upon the first Information he received of <b>Sir</b>  <b>Roger's</b> Death; when
he sent me up word, that if I would get him chosen in the Place of the
Deceased, he would present me with a Barrel of the best <i>October</i> I had
ever drank in my Life. The Ladies are in great Pain to know whom I
intend to elect in the Room of <b>Will. Honeycombe.</b> Some of them indeed are
of Opinion that Mr. <b>Honeycombe</b> did not take sufficient care of their
Interests in the Club, and are therefore de<b>Sir</b> ous of having in it
hereafter a Representative of their own Sex. A Citizen who subscribes
himself<i> Y. Z.</i> tells me that he has one and twenty Shares in the
<i>African</i> Company, and offers to bribe me with the odd one in case he
may succeed <b>Sir</b>  <b>Andrew Freeport</b>, which he thinks would raise the Credit
of that Fund. I have several Letters, dated from <i>Fenny Man's</i>, by
Gentlemen who are Candidates for Capt. <b>Sentry's</b> Place, and as many from
a Coffee-House in <i>Paul's</i> Church-yard of such who would fill up the
Vacancy occasioned by the Death of my worthy Friend the Clergyman, whom
I can never mention but with a particular Respect.<br>
<br>
Having maturely weighed these several Particulars, with the many
Remonstrances that have been made to me on this Subject, and considering
how invidious an Office I shall take upon me, if I make the whole
Election depend upon my single Voice, and being unwilling to expose my
self to those Clamours, which, on such an Occasion, will not fail to be
raised against me for Partiality, Injustice, Corruption, and other
Qualities which my Nature abhors, I have formed to my self the Project
of a Club as follows.<br>
<br>
I have thoughts of issuing out Writs to all and every of the Clubs that
are established in the Cities of <i>London</i> and <i>Westminster</i>, requiring
them to chuse out of their respective Bodies a Person of the greatest
Merit, and to return his name to me before <i>Lady-day</i>, at which time I
intend to sit upon Business.<br>
<br>
By this means I may have Reason to hope, that the Club over which I
shall preside will be the very Flower and Quintescence of all other
Clubs. I have communicated this my Project to none but a particular
Friend of mine, whom I have celebrated twice or thrice for his Happiness
in that kind of Wit which is commonly known by the Name of a Punn. The
only Objection he makes to it is, that I shall raise up Enemies to my
self if I act with so regal an Air; and that my Detractors, instead of
giving me the usual Title of SPECTATOR, will be apt to call me the <i>King
of Clubs</i>.<br>
<br>
But to proceed on my intended Project: It is very well known that I at
first set forth in this Work with the Character of a silent Man; and I
think I have so well preserved my Taciturnity, that I do not remember to
have violated it with three Sentences in the space of almost two Years.
As a Monosyllable is my Delight, I have made very few Excursions in the
Conversations which I have related beyond a Yes or a No. By this Means
my Readers have lost many good things which I have had in my Heart,
though I did not care for uttering them.<br>
<br>
Now in order to diversify my Character, and to shew the World how well I
can talk if I have a Mind, I have Thoughts of being very loquacious in
the Club which I have now under Consideration. But that I may proceed
the more regularly in this Affair, I design, upon the first Meeting of
the said Club, to have <i>my Mouth opened</i> in form; intending to regulate
my self in this Particular by a certain Ritual which I have by me, that
contains all the Ceremonies which are practised at the opening of the
Mouth of a Cardinal. I have likewise examined the forms which were used
of old by <i>Pythagoras</i>, when any of his Scholars, after an
Apprenticeship of Silence, was made free of his Speech. In the mean
time, as I have of late found my Name in foreign Gazettes upon less
Occasions, I question <a name="fr5501">not</a> but in their next Articles from <i>Great
Britain</i>, they will inform the World that <i>the</i> <b>Spectator's</b> <i>Mouth is to
be opened on the twenty-fifth of</i> March <i>next</i><a href="#f5501"><sup>1</sup></a>. I may perhaps
publish a very useful Paper at that Time of the Proceedings in that
Solemnity, and of the Persons who shall assist at it. But of this more

<br>
  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  When Men of worthy and excelling Genius's have obliged the World with
  beautiful and instructive Writings, it is in the nature of Gratitude
  that Praise should be returned them, as one proper consequent Reward
  of their Performances. Nor has Mankind ever been so degenerately sunk,
  but they have made this Return, and even when they have not been
  wrought up by the generous Endeavour so as to receive the Advantages
  designed by it. This Praise, which arises first in the Mouth of
  particular Persons, spreads and lasts according to the Merit of
  Authors; and when it thus meets with a full Success changes its
  Denomination, and is called <i>Fame</i>. They who have happily arrived at
  this, are, even while they live, enflamed by the Acknowledgments of
  others, and spurred on to new Undertakings for the Benefit of Mankind,
  notwithstanding the Detraction which some abject Tempers would cast
  upon them: But when they decease, their Characters being freed from
  the Shadow which <i>Envy</i> laid them under, begin to shine out with
  greater Splendour; their Spirits survive in their Works; they are
  admitted into the highest Companies, and they continue pleasing and
  instructing Posterity from Age to Age. Some of the best gain a
  Character, by being able to shew that they are no Strangers to them;
  and others obtain a new Warmth to labour for the Happiness and Ease of
  Mankind, from a Reflection upon those Honours which are paid to their
  Memories.<br>
<br>
  The Thought of this took me up as I turned over those Epigrams which
  are the Remains of several of the <i>Wits</i> of <i>Greece</i>, and perceived
  many dedicated to the Fame of those who had excelled in beautiful
  poetick Performances. Wherefore, in pursuance to my Thought, I
  concluded to do something along with them to bring their Praises into
  a new Light and Language, for the Encouragement of those whose modest
  Tempers may be deterr'd by the Fear of Envy or Detraction from fair
  Attempts, to which their Parts might render them equal. You will
  perceive them as they follow to be conceived in the form of Epitaphs,
  a sort of Writing which is wholly set apart for a short pointed Method
  of Praise.

<blockquote>On <i>Orpheus</i>, written by <i>Antipater</i>.<br><br>

<i>No longer</i>, Orpheus, <i>shall thy sacred Strains<br>
Lead Stones, and Trees, and Beasts along the Plains;<br>
No longer sooth the boistrous Wind to sleep,<br>
Or still the Billows of the raging Deep:<br>
For thou art gone, the Muses mourn'd thy Fall<br>
In solemn Strains, thy Mother most of all.<br>
Ye Mortals, idly for your Sons ye moan,<br>
If thus a Goddess could not save her own.</i></blockquote>

  Observe here, that if we take the Fable for granted, as it was
  believed to be in that Age when the Epigram was written, the Turn
  appears to have Piety to the Gods, and a resigning Spirit in its
  Application. But if we consider the Point with respect to our present
  Knowledge, it will be less esteem'd; though the Author himself,
  because he believ'd it, may still be more valued than any one who
  should now write with a Point of the same Nature.

<blockquote>On <i>Homer</i>, by <i>Alpheus</i> of <i>Mytilene</i>.<br><br>

<i>Still in our Ears</i> Andromache <i>complains,<br>
And still in sight the Fate of</i> Troy <i>remains;<br>
Still</i> Ajax <i>fights, still</i> Hector's <i>dragg'd along,<br>
Such strange Enchantment dwells in</i> Homer's <i>Song;<br>
Whose Birth cou'd more than one poor Realm adorn,<br>
For all the World is proud that he was born.</i></blockquote>

  The Thought in the first part of this is natural, and depending upon
  the Force of Poesy: In the latter part it looks as if it would aim at
  the History of seven Towns contending for the Honour of <i>Homer's</i>
  Birth-place; but when you expect to meet with that common Story, the
  Poet slides by, and raises the whole <i>World</i> for a kind of <i>Arbiter</i>,
  which is to end the Contention amongst its several Parts.

<blockquote>On <i>Anacreon</i> by <i>Antipater</i>.<br><br>

<i>This Tomb be thine,</i> Anacreon; <i>all around<br>
Let Ivy wreath, let Flourets deck the Ground,<br>
And from its Earth, enrich'd with such a Prize,<br>
Let Wells of Milk and Streams of Wine arise:<br>
So will thine Ashes yet a Pleasure know,<br>
If any Pleasure reach the Shades below.</i></blockquote>

  The Poet here written upon, is an easy gay Author, and he who writes
  upon him has filled his own Head with the Character of his Subject. He
  seems to love his Theme so much, that he thinks of nothing but
  pleasing him as if he were still alive, by entering into his Libertine
  Spirit; so that the Humour is easy and gay, resembling <i>Anacreon</i> in
  its Air, raised by such Images, and pointed with such a Turn as he
  might have used. I give it a place here, because the Author may have
  design'd it for his Honour; and I take an Opportunity from it to
  advise others, that when they would praise, they cautiously avoid
  every looser Qualification, and fix only where there is a real
  Foundation in Merit.

<blockquote>On <i>Euripides</i>, by <i>Ion</i>.<br><br>

<i>Divine</i> Euripides, <i>this Tomb we see<br>
So fair, is not a Monument for thee,<br>
So much as thou for it, since all will own<br>
Thy Name and lasting Praise adorns the Stone.</i></blockquote>

  The Thought here is fine, but its Fault is, that it is general, that
  it may belong to any great Man, because it points out no particular
  Character. It would be better, if when we light upon such a Turn, we
  join it with something that circumscribes and bounds it to the
  Qualities of our Subject. He who gives his Praise in gross, will often
  appear either to have been a Stranger to those he writes upon, or not
  to have found any thing in them which is Praise-worthy.

<blockquote>On <i>Sophocles</i>, by <i>Simonides</i>.<br><br>

<i>Winde, gentle Ever-green, to form a Shade<br>
Around the Tomb where</i> Sophocles <i>is laid;<br>
Sweet Ivy winde thy Boughs, and intertwine<br>
With blushing Roses and the clustring Vine:<br>
Thus will thy lasting Leaves, with Beauties hung,<br>
Prove grateful Emblems of the Lays he sung;<br>
Whose Soul, exalted like a</i> God <i>of</i> Wit,<br>
<i>Among the</i> Muses <i>and the</i> Graces <i>writ.</i></blockquote>

  This Epigram I have open'd more than any of the former: The Thought
  towards the latter End seemed closer couched, so as to require an
  Explication. I fancied the Poet aimed at the Picture which is
  generally made of <i>Apollo</i> and the <i>Muses</i>, he sitting with his Harp
  in the Middle, and they around him. This look'd beautiful to my
  Thought, and because the Image arose before me out of the Words of the
  Original as I was reading it, I venture to explain them so.

<blockquote>On <i>Menander</i>, the Author unnamed.<br><br>

<i>The very Bees, O sweet</i> Menander, <i>hung<br>
To taste the</i> Muses <i>Spring upon thy Tongue;<br>
The very</i> Graces <i>made the Scenes you writ<br>
Their happy Point of fine Expression hit.<br>
Thus still you live, you make your</i> Athens <i>shine,<br>
And raise its Glory to the Skies in thine.</i></blockquote>

  This Epigram has a respect to the Character of its Subject; for
  <i>Menander</i> writ remarkably with a Justness and Purity of Language. It
  has also told the Country he was born in, without either a set or a
  hidden Manner, while it twists together the Glory of the Poet and his
  Nation, so as to make the Nation depend upon his for an Encrease of
  its own.<br>
<br>
  I will offer no more Instances at present, to shew that they who
  deserve Praise have it returned them from different Ages. Let these
  which have been laid down, shew Men that Envy will not always prevail.
  And to the End that Writers may more successfully enliven the
  Endeavours of one another, let them consider, in some such Manner as I
  have attempted, what may be the justest Spirit and Art of Praise. It
  is indeed very hard to come up to it. Our Praise is trifling when it
  depends upon Fable; it is false when it depends upon wrong
  Qualifications; it means nothing when it is general; it is extreamly
  difficult to hit when we propose to raise Characters high, while we
  keep to them justly. I shall end this with transcribing that excellent
  Epitaph of Mr. <i>Cowley</i>, wherein, with a kind of grave and
  philosophick Humour, he very beautifully speaks of himself (withdrawn
  from the World, and dead to all the Interests of it) as of a Man
  really deceased. At the same time it is an Instruction how to leave
  the Publick with a good Grace.

<blockquote>Epitaphium Vivi Authoris.<br><br>

<i>Hic, O Viator, sub Lare parvulo</i><br>
Couleius <i>hic est conditus, hic jacet<br>
  Defunctus Humani Laboris<br>

Palliative of Praise; and very often conveys the noblest Panegyrick
under the Appearance of Satire. <i>Homer</i> is here seemingly accused and
treated as a Plagiary; but what is drawn up in the form of an Accusation
is certainly, as my Correspondent observes, the greatest Compliment that

  dangerous Method of Sword and Pistol, I made my Assaults by that more
  secure one of Writ or Warrant. I cannot help telling you, that either
  by the Justice of my Causes, or the Superiority of my Counsel, I have
  been generally successful; and to my great Satisfaction I can say it,
  that by three Actions of Slander, and half a dozen Trespasses, I have
  for several Years enjoy'd a perfect Tranquility in my Reputation and
  Estate. By these means also I have been made known to the Judges, the
  Serjeants of our Circuit are my intimate Friends, and the Ornamental
  Counsel pay a very profound Respect to one who has made so great a
  Figure in the Law. Affairs of Consequence having brought me to Town, I
  had the Curiosity t'other day to visit <i>Westminster-Hall</i>; and having
  placed my self in one of the Courts, expected to be most agreeably
  entertained. After the Court and Counsel were, with due Ceremony,
  seated, up stands a learned Gentleman, and began, When this <i>Matter</i>
  was last <i>stirr'd</i> before your Lordship: The next humbly moved to
  <i>quash</i> an <i>Indictment</i>; another complain'd that his Adversary had
  <i>snapp'd</i> a <i>Judgment</i>; the next informed the Court that his Client
  was <i>stripp'd</i> of his <i>Possession</i>; another begg'd Leave to acquaint
  his Lordship, that they had been <i>saddled</i> with <i>Costs</i>. At last up got
  a grave Serjeant, and told us his Client had been <i>hung up</i> a whole
  Term by a <i>Writ of Error</i>. At this I could bear it no longer, but came
  hither, and resolv'd to apply my self to your Honour to interpose with
  these Gentlemen, that they would leave off such low and unnatural
  Expressions: For surely tho' the Lawyers subscribe to hideous <i>French</i>
  and false <i>Latin</i>, yet they should let their Clients have a little
  decent and proper <i>English</i> for their Money. What Man that has a Value
  for a good Name would like to have it said in a publick Court, that
  Mr. such-a-one was <i>stripp'd, saddled</i> or <i>hung up</i>? This being what
  has escaped your Spectatorial Observation, be pleas'd to correct such
  an illiberal Cant among profess'd Speakers, and you'll infinitely
  oblige <br>
<i>Your humble Servant</i>,<br>
Philonicus.<br>

As I was tumbling about the Town the other Day in an Hackney-Coach, and
delighting my self with busy Scenes in the Shops of each Side of me, it
came into my Head, with no small Remorse, that I had not been frequent
enough in the Mention and Recommendation of the industrious Part of
Mankind. It very <a name="fr5521">naturally</a>, upon this Occasion, touched my Conscience in
particular, that I had not acquitted my self to my Friend Mr. <i>Peter
Motteux</i><a href="#f5521"><sup>1</sup></a>. That industrious Man of Trade, and formerly Brother of the
Quill, has dedicated to me a Poem upon Tea. It would injure him, as a
Man of Business, if I did not let the World know that the Author of so
good Verses writ them before he was concern'd in Traffick. In order to
expiate my Negligence towards him, I immediately resolv'd to make him a
Visit. I found his spacious Warehouses fill'd and adorn'd with Tea,
<i>China</i> and <i>Indian</i> Ware. I could observe a beautiful Ordonnance of the
whole; and such different and considerable Branches of Trade carried on,
in the same House, I exulted in seeing dispos'd by a Poetical Head. In
one place were exposed to view Silks of various Shades and Colours, rich
Brocades, and the wealthiest Products of foreign Looms.<br>
<br>
Here you might see the finest Laces held up by the fairest Hands, and
there examin'd by the beauteous Eyes of the Buyers, the most delicate
Cambricks, Muslins, and Linnens. I could not but congratulate my Friend
on the humble, but, I hoped, beneficial Use he had made of his Talents,
and wished I could be a Patron to his Trade, as he had been pleased to
make me of his Poetry. The honest Man has, I know, that modest De<b>Sir</b> e of
Gain which is peculiar to those who understand better Things than
Riches: and I dare say he would be contented with much less than what is
called Wealth at that Quarter of the Town which he inhabits, and will
oblige all his Customers with Demands agreeable to the Moderation of his
De<b>Sir</b> es.<br>
<br>
Among other Omissions of which I have been also guilty, with relation to
Men of Industry of a superior Order, I must acknowledge my Silence
towards a Proposal frequently enclosed to me by Mr. <i>Renatus Harris,
Organ-Builder</i>. The ambition of this Artificer is to erect an Organ in
St. <i>Paul's</i> Cathedral, over the West Door, at the Entrance into the
Body of the Church, which in Art and Magnificence shall transcend any
Work of that kind ever before invented. The Proposal in perspicuous
Language sets forth the Honour and Advantage such a Performance would be
to the <i>British</i> Name, as well as that it would apply the Power of
Sounds in a manner more amazingly forcible than, perhaps, has yet been
known, and I am sure to an End much more worthy. Had the vast Sums which
have been laid out upon Opera's without Skill or Conduct, and to no
other Purpose but to suspend or vitiate our Understandings, been
disposed this Way, we should now perhaps have an Engine so formed as to
strike the Minds of half a People at once in a Place of Worship with a
Forgetfulness of present Care and Calamity, and a Hope of endless
Rapture, Joy, and Hallelujah hereafter.<br>
<br>
When I am doing this Justice, I am not to forget the best Mechanick of
my Acquaintance, that useful Servant to Science and Knowledge, Mr. <i>John
Rowley</i>; but I think I lay a great Obligation on the Publick, by
acquainting them with his Proposals for a Pair of new Globes. After his
Preamble, he promises in the said Proposals that,

<blockquote>  <i>In the Celestial Globe,</i><br>
<br>
  'Care shall be taken that the fixed Stars be placed according to their
  true Longitude and Latitude, from the many and correct Observations of
  <i>Hevelius, Cassini</i>, Mr. <i>Flamsteed</i>, Reg. Astronomer, Dr. <i>Halley
  Savilian</i> Professor of Geometry in <i>Oxon</i>; and from whatever else can
  be procured to render the Globe more exact, instructive, and useful.<br>
<br>
  'That all the Constellations be drawn in a curious, new, and
  particular manner; each Star in so just, distinct, and conspicuous a
  Proportion, that its true Magnitude may be readily known by bare
  Inspection, according to the different <i>Light</i> and <i>Sizes</i> of the
  Stars. That the Track or Way of such Comets as have been well
  observ'd, but not hitherto expressed in any Globe, be carefully
  delineated in this.<br>
<br>
  <i>In the Terrestrial Globe.</i>

  'That <a name="fr5522">by</a> reason the Descriptions formerly made, both in the <i>English</i>
  <span style="color: #663300;">and</span><a href="#f5522"><sup>2</sup></a> <i>Dutch</i> great Globes, are erroneous, <i>Asia, Africa</i>, and
  <i>America</i>, be drawn in a Manner wholly new; by which means it is to be
  noted, that the Undertakers will be obliged to alter the Latitude of
  some Places in 10 Degrees, the Longitude of others in 20 Degrees:
  besides which great and necessary Alterations, there be many
  remarkable Countries, Cities, Towns, Rivers, and Lakes, omitted in
  other Globes, inserted here according to the best Discoveries made by
  our late Navigators. Lastly, That the Course of the Trade-Winds, the
  <i>Monsoons</i>, and other Winds periodically shifting between the
  Tropicks, be visibly express'd.<br>
<br>
<br>
  'Now in Regard that this Undertaking is of so universal Use, as the
  Advancement of the most necessary Parts of the Mathematicks, as well
  as tending to the Honour of the <i>British</i> Nation, and that the Charge
  of carrying it on is very expensive; it is de<b>Sir</b> ed that all Gentlemen
  who are willing to promote so great a Work, will be pleased to
  subscribe on the following Conditions.
<ol type="I">
 <li>The Undertakers engage to furnish each Subscriber with a Celestial
  and Terrestrial Globe, each of 30 Inches Diameter, in all Respects
  curiously adorned, the Stars gilded, the Capital Cities plainly
  distinguished, the Frames, Meridians, Horizons, Hour Circles and
  Indexes so exactly finished up, and accurately divided, that a Pair of
  these Globes will really appear in the Judgment of any disinterested
  and intelligent Person, worth Fifteen Pounds more than will be
  demanded for them by the Undertakers.</li></ol>

<ol start=2 type="I"><li>
  Whosoever will be pleas'd to subscribe, and pay Twenty Five
  Pounds in the Manner following for a Pair of these Globes, either for
  their own Use, or to present them to any College in the Universities,
  or any publick Library or School, shall have his Coat of Arms, Name,
  Title, Seat, or Place of Residence, <i>&amp;c.,</i> inserted in some convenient
  Place of the Globe.</li></ol>

<ol start=3 type="I"><li>

  That every Subscriber do at first pay down the Sum of Ten
  Pounds, and Fifteen Pounds more upon the delivery of each Pair of
  Globes perfectly fitted up. And that the said Globes be deliver'd
  within Twelve Months after the Number of Thirty Subscribers be
  compleated; and that the Subscribers be served with Globes in the
  Order in which they subscribed.</li></ol>

<ol start=4 type="I"><li>

  That a Pair of these Globes shall not hereafter to be sold to any
  Person but the Subscribers under Thirty Pounds.</li></ol>

<ol start=5 type="I"><li>

  That if there be not thirty Subscribers within four Months after
  the first of <i>December</i>, 1712, the Money paid shall be return'd on
  Demand by Mr. <i>John Warner</i> Gold-smith near <i>Temple-Bar</i>, who shall
  receive and pay the same according to the above-mention'd Articles.</li></ol></blockquote>

The Project which I published on <i>Monday</i> last has brought me in several
Packets of Letters. Among the rest I have receiv'd one from a certain
Projector, wherein after having represented, that in all probability the
Solemnity of <i>opening my Mouth</i> will draw together a great Confluence of
Beholders, he proposes to me the hiring of <i>Stationer's-Hall</i> for the
more convenient exhibiting of that Publick Ceremony. He undertakes to be
at the Charge of it himself, provided he may have the erecting of
Galleries on every side, and the letting of them out upon that Occasion.
I have a Letter also from a Bookseller, petitioning me in a very humble
manner, that he may have the Printing of the Speech which I shall make
to the Assembly upon the first opening of my Mouth. I am informed from
all Parts, that there are great Canvassings in the several Clubs about
Town, upon the chusing of a proper Person to sit with me on those
arduous Affairs, to which I have summoned them. Three Clubs have already
proceeded to Election, whereof one has made a double Return. If I find
that my Enemies shall take Advantage of my Silence to begin Hostilities
upon me, or if any other Exigency of Affairs may so require, since I see
Elections in so great a forwardness, we may possibly meet before the Day
appointed; or if matters go on to my Satisfaction, I may perhaps put off
the Meeting to a further Day; but of this Publick Notice shall be given.<br>
<br>
In the mean time, I must confess that I am not a little gratify'd and
oblig'd by that Concern which appears in this great City upon my present
Design of laying down this Paper. It is likewise with much Satisfaction,
that I find some of the most outlying Parts of the Kingdom alarm'd upon
this Occasion, having receiv'd Letters to expostulate with me about it,
from several of my Readers of the remotest Boroughs of <i>Great Britain</i>.
Among these I am very well pleased with a Letter dated from <i>Berwick
upon Tweed</i>, wherein my Correspondent compares the Office which I have
for some time executed in these Realms to the Weeding of a great Garden;
which, says he, it is not sufficient to weed once for all, and
afterwards to give over, but that the Work must be continued daily, or
the same Spots of Ground which are cleared for a while, will in a little
time be over-run as much as ever. Another Gentleman lays before me
several Enormities that are already sprouting, and which he believes
will discover themselves in their Growth immediately after my
Disappearance. There is no doubt, says he, but the Ladies Heads will
shoot up as soon as they know they are no longer under the <i><b>Spectator's</b></i>
Eye; and I have already seen such monstrous broad-brimmed Hats under the
Arms of Foreigners, that I question not but they will overshadow the
Island within a Month or two after the dropping of your Paper. But among
all the Letters which are come to my hands, there is none so handsomely
written as the following one, which I am the more pleased with, as it is
sent me from Gentlemen who belong to a Body which I shall always Honour,
and where (I cannot speak it without a secret Pride) my Speculations
have met with a very kind Reception. It is usual for Poets, upon the
publishing of their Works, to print before them such Copies of Verses as
have been made in their Praise. Not that you must imagine they are
pleased with their own Commendations, but because the elegant
Compositions of their Friends should not be lost. I must make the same
Apology for the Publication of the ensuing Letter, in which I have
suppressed no Part of those Praises that are given my Speculations with
too lavish and good-natured an Hand; though my Correspondents can
witness for me, that at other times I have generally blotted out those
Parts in the Letters which I have received from them.<br>

<blockquote>  <i>Oxford, Nov. 25.</i><br>
<br>
  <i>Mr</i>. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'In spight of your Invincible Silence you have found out a Method of
  being the most agreeable Companion in the World: That kind of
  Conversation which you hold with the Town, has the good Fortune of
  being always pleasing to the Men of Taste and Leisure, and never
  offensive to those of Hurry and Business. You are never heard, but at
  what <i>Horace</i> calls <i>dextro tempore</i>, and have the Happiness to
  observe the politick Rule, which the same discerning Author gave his
  Friend, when he enjoin'd him to deliver his Book to <i>Augustus</i>.

<blockquote><i>Si validus, si l&aelig;tus erit, si denique poscet.</i></blockquote>

You never begin to talk, but when People are de<b>Sir</b> ous to hear you;
  and I defy any one to be out of humour till you leave off. But I am
  led unawares into Reflections, foreign to the original Design of this
  Epistle; which was to let you know, that some unfeigned Admirers of
  your inimitable Papers, who could, without any Flattery, greet you
  with the Salutation used to the Eastern Monarchs, <i>viz. O Spec, live
  for ever</i>, have lately been under the same Apprehensions, with Mr.
  <i>Philo-Spec</i>; that the haste you have made to dispatch your best
  Friends portends no long Duration to your own short Visage. We could
  not, indeed, find any just Grounds for Complaint in the Method you
  took to dissolve that venerable Body: No, the World was not worthy of
  your Divine. <b>Will. Honeycomb</b> could not, with any Reputation, live
  single any longer. It was high time for the <b>Templar</b> to turn himself to
  <i>Coke</i>: And <b>Sir</b>  <b>Roger's</b> dying was the wisest thing he ever did in his
  Life. It was, however, matter of great Grief to us, to think that we
  were in danger of losing so Elegant and Valuable an Entertainment. And
  we could not, without Sorrow, reflect that we were likely to have
  nothing to interrupt our Sips in a Morning, and to suspend our Coffee
  in mid-air, between our Lips and Right Ear, but the ordinary Trash of
  News-Papers. We resolved, therefore, not to part with you so. But
  since, to make use of your own Allusion, the Cherries began now to
  crowd the Market, and their Season was almost over, we consulted our
  future Enjoyments, and endeavoured to make the exquisite Pleasure that
  delicious Fruit gave our Taste as lasting as we could, and by drying
  them protract their stay beyond its natural Date. We own that thus
  they have not a Flavour equal to that of their juicy Bloom; but yet,
  under this Disadvantage, they pique the Palate, and become a Salver
  better than any other Fruit at its first Appearance. To speak plain,
  there are a Number of us who have begun your Works afresh, and meet
  two Nights in the Week in order to give you a Rehearing. We never come
  together without drinking your Health, and as seldom part without
  general Expressions of Thanks to you for our Night's Improvement. This
  we conceive to be a more useful Institution than any other Club
  whatever, not excepting even that of <i>ugly Faces</i>. We have one
  manifest Advantage over that renowned Society, with respect to Mr.
  <i><b>Spectator's</b></i> Company. For though they may brag, that you sometimes
  make your personal Appearance amongst them, it is impossible they
  should ever get a Word from you. Whereas you are with us the Reverse
  of what <i>Ph&aelig;dria</i> would have his Mistress be in his Rival's Company,
  <i>Present in your Absence</i>. We make you talk as much and as long as we
  please; and let me tell you, you seldom hold your Tongue for the whole
  Evening. I promise my self you will look with an Eye of Favour upon a
  Meeting which owes its Original to a mutual Emulation among its
  Members, who shall shew the most profound Respect for your Paper; not
  but we have a very great Value for your Person: and I dare say you can
  no where find four more sincere Admirers, and humble Servants, than
  <i>T. F., G. S., J. T., E. T.</i></blockquote><br>

<br>

I am obliged for the following Essay, as well as for that which lays
down Rules out of <i>Tully</i> for Pronunciation and Action, to the Ingenious
Author of a Poem just Published, Entitled, <i>An Ode to the Creator of the
World, occasioned by the Fragments of</i> Orpheus.<br>
<br>
It is a Remark made, as I remember, by a celebrated <i>French</i> Author,
that <i>no Man ever pushed his Capacity as far as it was able to extend</i>.
I shall not enquire whether this Assertion be strictly true. It may
suffice to say, that Men of the greatest Application and Acquirements
can look back upon many vacant Spaces, and neglected Parts of Time,
which have slipped away from them unemployed; and there is hardly any
one considering Person in the World, but is apt to fancy with himself,
at some time or other, that if his Life were to begin again, he could
fill it up better.<br>
<br>
The Mind is most provoked to cast on it self this ingenuous Reproach,
when the Examples of such Men are presented to it, as have far outshot
the generality of their Species, in Learning, Arts, or any valuable
Improvements.<br>
<br>
One of the most extensive and improved Genius's we have had any Instance
of in our own Nation, or in any other, was that of <b>Sir</b>  <i>Francis Bacon</i>
Lord <i>Verulam.</i> This great Man, by an extraordinary Force of Nature,
Compass of Thought, and indefatigable Study, had amassed to himself such
stores of Knowledge as we cannot look upon without Amazement. His
Capacity seems to have grasped All that was revealed in Books before his
Time; and not satisfied with that, he began to strike out new Tracks of
Science, too many to be travelled over by any one Man, in the Compass of
the longest Life. These, therefore, he could only mark down, like
imperfect Coastings in Maps, or supposed Points of Land, to be further
discovered, and ascertained by the Industry of After-Ages, who should
proceed upon his Notices or Conjectures.<br>
<br>
The Excellent Mr. <i>Boyle</i> was the Person, who seems to have been
designed by Nature to succeed to the Labours and Enquiries of that
extraordinary Genius I have just mentioned. By innumerable Experiments
He, in a great Measure, filled up those Planns and Out-Lines of Science,
which his Predecessor had sketched out. His Life was spent in the
Pursuit of Nature, through a great Variety of Forms and Changes, and in
the most rational, as well as devout Adoration of its Divine Author.<br>
<br>
It would be impossible to name many Persons who have extended their
Capacities so far as these two, in the Studies they pursued; but my
learned Readers, <a name="fr5541">on</a> this Occasion, will naturally turn their Thoughts to
a <i>Third</i><a href="#f5541"><sup>1</sup></a>, who is yet living, and is likewise the Glory of our own
Nation. The Improvements which others had made in Natural and
Mathematical Knowledge have so vastly increased in his Hands, as to
afford at once a wonderful Instance how great the Capacity is of a Human
Soul, and how inexhaustible the Subject of its Enquiries; so true is
that Remark in Holy Writ, that, <i>though a wise Man seek to find out the
Works of God from the Beginning to the End, yet shall he not be able to
do it</i>.<br>
<br>
I cannot help mentioning here one Character more, of a different kind
indeed from these, yet such a one as may serve to shew the wonderful
Force of Nature and of Application, and is the most singular Instance of
an Universal Genius I have ever met with. The Person I mean is <i>Leonardo
da Vinci</i>, an <i>Italian</i> Painter, descended from a noble Family in
<i>Tuscany</i>, about the beginning of the sixteenth Century. In his
Profession of History-Painting he was so great a Master, that some have
affirmed he excelled all who went before him<span style="color: #996633;">. It is certain</span>, that he
raised the Envy of <i>Michael Angelo</i>, who was his Contemporary, and that
from the Study of his Works <i>Raphael</i> himself learned his best Manner of
Designing. He was a Master too in Sculpture and Architecture, and
skilful in Anatomy, Mathematicks, and Mechanicks. The Aqu&aelig;duct from the
River <i>Adda</i> to <i>Milan</i>, is mentioned as a Work of his Contrivance. He
had learned several Languages, and was acquainted with the Studies of
History, Philosophy, Poetry, and Musick. Though it is not necessary to
my present Purpose, I cannot but take notice, that all who have writ of
him mention likewise his Perfections of Body. The Instances of his
Strength are almost incredible. He is described to have been of a
well-formed Person, and a Master of all genteel Exercises. And lastly,
we are told that his moral Qualities were agreeable to his natural and
intellectual Endowments, and that he was of an honest and generous Mind,
adorned with great Sweetness of Manners. I might break off the Account
of him here, but I imagine it will be an Entertainment to the Curiosity
of my Readers, to find so remarkable a Character distinguished by as
remarkable a Circumstance at his Death. The Fame of his Works having
gained him an universal Esteem, he was invited to the Court of <i>France</i>,
where, after some time, he fell sick; and <i>Francis the First</i> coming to
see him, he raised himself in his Bed to acknowledge the Honour which
was done him by that Visit. The King embraced him, and <i>Leonardo</i>
fainting at the same Instant, expired in the Arms of that great Monarch.<br>
<br>
It is impossible to attend to such Instances as these, without being
raised into a Contemplation on the wonderful Nature of an Human Mind,
which is capable of such Progressions in Knowledge, and can contain such
a Variety of Ideas without Perplexity or Confusion. How reasonable is it
from hence to infer its Divine Original? And whilst we find unthinking
Matter endued with a Natural Power to last for ever, unless annihilated
by Omnipotence, how absurd would it be to imagine, that a Being so much
Superior to it should not have the same Privilege?<br>
<br>
At the same time it is very surprizing, when we remove our Thoughts from
such Instances as I have mentioned, to consider those we so frequently
meet with in the Accounts of barbarous Nations among the <i>Indians</i>;
where we find Numbers of People who scarce shew the first Glimmerings of
Reason, and seem to have few Ideas above those of Sense and Appetite.
These, methinks, appear like large Wilds, or vast uncultivated Tracts of
Human Nature; and when we compare them with Men of the most exalted
Characters in Arts and Learning, we find it difficult to believe that
they are Creatures of the same Species.<br>
<br>
Some are of Opinion that the Souls of Men are all naturally equal, and
that the great Disparity we so often observe, arises from the different
Organization or Structure of the Bodies to which they are United. But
whatever constitutes this first Disparity, the next great Difference
which we find between Men in their several Acquirements is owing to
accidental Differences in their Education, Fortunes, or Course of Life.
The Soul is a kind of rough Diamond, which requires Art, Labour, and
Time to polish it. For want of which, many a good natural Genius is
lost, or lies unfashioned, like a Jewel in the Mine.<br>
<br>
One of the strongest Incitements to excel in such Arts and
Accomplishments as are in the highest Esteem among Men, is the natural
Passion which the Mind of Man has for Glory; which, though it may be
faulty in the Excess of it, ought by no means to be discouraged. Perhaps
some Moralists are too severe in beating down this Principle, which
seems to be a Spring implanted by Nature to give Motion to all the
latent Powers of the Soul, and is always observed to exert it self with
the greatest Force in the most generous Dispositions. The Men whose
Characters have shone the brightest among the ancient <i>Romans</i>, appear
to have been strongly animated by this Passion. <i>Cicero</i>, whose Learning
and Services to his Country are <a name="fr5542"	>so</a> well known, was enflamed by it to an
extravagant degree, and warmly presses <i>Lucceius</i><a href="#f5542"><sup>2</sup></a>, who was composing
a History of those Times, to be very particular and zealous in relating
the Story of his Consulship; and to execute it speedily, that he might
have the Pleasure <a name="fr5543"	>of</a> enjoying in his Life-time some Part of the <span style="color: #996633;">Honour</span><a href="#f5543"><sup>3</sup></a> which he foresaw wou'd be paid to his Memory. This was the Ambition
of a great Mind; but he is faulty in the Degree of it, and cannot
refrain from solliciting the Historian upon this Occasion to neglect the
strict Laws of History, and, in praising him, <i>even to exceed the Bounds
of Truth</i>. The younger <i>Pliny</i> appears to have had the same Passion for
Fame, but accompanied with greater Chastness and Modesty. His Ingenuous
manner of owning it to a Friend, who had prompted him to undertake some
great Work, is exquisitely beautiful, and raises him to a certain
Grandeur above the Imputation of Vanity. <i>I must confess</i>, <a name="fr5544"	>says</a> he,
<i>that nothing employs my Thoughts more than the De<b>Sir</b> e I have of
perpetuating my Name; which in my Opinion is a Design worthy of a Man,
at least of such a one, who being conscious of no Guilt, is not afraid
to be remember'd by Posterity</i><a href="#f5544"><sup>4</sup></a>.<br>
<br>
I think I ought not to conclude, without interesting all my Readers in
the Subject of this Discourse: I shall therefore lay it down as a Maxim,
that though all are not capable of shining in Learning or the Politer
Arts; yet <i>every one is capable of excelling in something</i>. The Soul has
in this Respect a certain vegetative Power, which cannot lie wholly
idle. If it is not laid out and cultivated into a regular and beautiful
Garden, it will of it self shoot up in Weeds or Flowers of a wilder
Growth.<br>

All the Members of the imaginary Society, which were described in my
First Papers, having disappear'd one after another, it is high time for
the <i>Spectator</i> himself to go off the Stage. But, now I am to take my
Leave, I am under much greater Anxiety than I have known for the Work of
any Day since I undertook this Province. It is much more difficult to
converse with the World in a real than a personated Character. That
might pass for Humour in the <i>Spectator</i>, which would look like
Arrogance in a Writer who sets his Name to his Work. The Fictitious
Person might contemn those who disapproved him, and extoll his own
Performances, without giving Offence. He might assume a mock-Authority,
without being looked upon as vain and conceited. The Praises or Censures
of himself fall only upon the Creature of his Imaginations; and if any
one finds fault with him, the Author may reply with the Philosopher of
old, <i>Thou dost but beat the Case of</i> Anaxarchus. When I speak in my own
private Sentiments, I cannot but address my self to my Readers in a more
submissive manner, and with a just Gratitude, for the kind Reception
which they have given to these Dayly Papers that have been published for
almost the space of Two Years last past.<br>
<br>
I hope the Apology I have made as to the Licence allowable to a feigned
Character, may excuse any thing which has been said in these Discourses
of the <i>Spectator</i> and his Works; but the Imputation of the grossest
Vanity would still dwell upon me, if I did not give some Account by what
Means I was enabled to keep up the Spirit of so long and approved a
Performance. All the Papers marked with a C, an L, an I, or an O, that
is to say, all the Papers which I have distinguished by any Letter in
the name of the Muse <i>CLIO</i>, were given me by the Gentleman, of whose
Assistance I formerly boasted in the Preface and concluding Leaf of my
<i>Tatlers.</i> I am indeed much more proud of his long-continued Friendship,
than I should be of the Fame of being thought the Author of any Writings
which he himself is capable of producing. I remember when I finished the
<i>Tender Husband</i>, I told him there was nothing I so ardently wished, as
that we might some time or other publish a Work written by us both,
which should bear the Name of <i>the Monument</i>, in Memory of our
Friendship. I heartily wish what I have done here, were as Honorary to
that Sacred Name, as Learning, Wit, and Humanity render those Pieces
which I have taught the Reader how to distinguish for his. When the Play
above-mentioned was last Acted, there were so many applauded Stroaks in
it which I had from the same Hand, that I thought very meanly of my self
that I had never publickly acknowledged them. After I have put other
Friends upon importuning him to publish Dramatick, as well as other
Writings he has by him, I shall end what I think I am obliged to say on
this Head, by giving my Reader this Hint for the better judging of my
Productions, that the best Comment upon them would be an Account when
the Patron to the <i>Tender Husband</i> was in <i>England</i>, or Abroad.<br>
<br>
The Reader will also find some Papers which are marked with the Letter
X, for which he is obliged to the Ingenious Gentleman who diverted the
Town with the Epilogue to the <i>Distressed Mother</i>. I might have owned
these several Papers with the free Consent of these Gentlemen, who did
not write them with a design of being known for the Authors. But as a
candid and sincere Behaviour ought to be preferred to all other
Considerations, I would not let my Heart reproach me with a
Consciousness of having acquired a Praise which is not my Right.<br>
<br>
The other Assistances which I have had, have been conveyed by Letter,
sometimes by whole Papers, and other times by short Hints from unknown
Hands. I have not been able to trace Favours of this kind, with any
Certainty, but to the following Names, which I place in the Order
wherein I received the Obligation, tho' the first I am going to name,
can hardly be mentioned in a List wherein he would not deserve the
Precedence. The Persons to whom I am to make these Acknowledgments are
Mr. <i>Henry Martyn</i>, Mr. <i>Pope</i>, Mr. <i>Hughs</i>, Mr. <i>Carey</i> of
<i>New-College</i> in <i>Oxford</i>, Mr. <i>Tickell</i> of <i>Queen's</i> in the same
University, Mr. <i>Parnelle</i>, and Mr. <i>Eusden</i> of <i>Trinity</i> in
<i>Cambridge.</i> Thus, to speak in the Language of my late Friend <b>Sir</b>  <b>Andrew
Freeport</b>, I have Ballanced my Accounts with all my Creditors for Wit and
Learning. But as these excellent Performances would not have seen the
Light without the means of this Paper, I may still arrogate to my self
the Merit of their being communicated to the Publick.<br>
<br>
I have nothing more to add, but having swelled this Work to five hundred
and fifty five Papers, they will be disposed into seven Volumes, four of
which are already publish'd, and the three others in the Press. It will
not be demanded of me why I now leave off, tho' I must own my self
obliged to give an Account to the Town of my Time hereafter; since I
retire when their Partiality to me is so great, that an Edition of the
former Volumes of <i><b>Spectators</b></i> of above Nine thousand each Book is
already sold off, and the Tax on each half-Sheet has brought into the
Stamp-Office one Week with another above <i>&pound;20.</i> a-Week arising from this
single Paper, notwithstanding it at first reduced it to less than half
the number that was usually Printed before this Tax was laid.<br>
<br>
I humbly beseech the Continuance of this Inclination to favour what I
may hereafter produce, and hope I have in many Occurrences of Life
tasted so deeply of Pain and Sorrow, that I am Proof against much more
prosperous Circumstances than any Advantages to which my own Industry
can possibly exalt me.<br>

<span style="color: #996633;">The <a name="fr5552">following</a> Letter</span><a href="#f5552"><sup>2</sup></a> regards an ingenious Sett of Gentlemen, who
have done me the Honour to make me one of their Society.
<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<blockquote>  <i>Dec.</i> 4, 1712.<br>
<br>
<i>Mr.</i> SPECTATOR, <br>
<br>
  'The Academy of <i>Painting</i>, lately established in <i>London</i>, having
  done you and themselves the Honour to chuse you one of their
  Directors; that Noble and Lovely Art, which before was entitled to
  your Regards, as a <i>Spectator</i>, has an additional Claim to you, and
  you seem to be under a double Obligation to take some Care of her
  Interests.<br>
<br>
  'The Honour of our Country is also concerned in the matter I am going
  to lay before you: we (and perhaps other Nations as well as we) have a
  National false Humility as well as a National Vain-Glory; and tho' we
  boast our selves to excel all the World in things wherein we are
  out-done abroad, in other things we attribute to others a Superiority
  which we our selves possess. This is what is done, particularly, in
  the Art of <i>Portrait</i> or <i>Face-Painting.</i><br>
<br>
 '<i>Painting</i> is an Art of a vast Extent, too great by much for any
  mortal Man to be in full possession of, in all its Parts; 'tis enough
  if any one succeed in painting Faces, History, Battels, Landscapes,
  Sea-Pieces, Fruit, Flowers, or Drolls, &amp;c. <a name="fr5553">Nay</a>, no Man ever was
  excellent in all the Branches (tho' <span style="color: #996633;">many</span><a href="#f5553"><sup>3</sup></a> in Number) of these
  several Arts, for a distinct Art I take upon me to call every one of
  those several Kinds of Painting.<br>
<br>
  'And as one Man may be a good Landscape-Painter, but unable to paint a
  Face or a History tollerably well, and so of the rest; one Nation may
  excel in some kinds of Painting, and other kinds may thrive better in
  other Climates.<br>
<br>
  '<i>Italy</i> may have the Preference of all other Nations for
  History-Painting; <i>Holland</i> for Drolls, and a neat finished Manner of
  Working; <i>France</i>, for Gay, Janty, Fluttering Pictures; and <i>England</i>
  for Portraits: but to give the Honour of every one of these kinds of
  Painting to any one of those Nations on account of their Excellence in
  any of these parts of it, is like adjudging the Prize of Heroick,
  Dramatick, Lyrick or Burlesque Poetry, to him who has done well in any
  one of them.<br>
<br>
  'Where there are the greatest Genius's, and most Helps and
  Encouragements, 'tis reasonable to suppose an Art will arrive to the
  greatest Perfection: By this Rule let us consider our own Country with
  respect to Face-Painting. No Nation in the World delights so much in
  having their own, or Friends, or Relations Pictures; whether from
  their National Good-Nature, or having a love to Painting, and not
  being encouraged in the great Article of Religious Pictures, which the
  Purity of our Worship refuses the free use of, or from whatever other
  Cause. Our Helps are not inferior to those of any other People, but
  rather they are greater; for what the Antique Statues and Bas-reliefs
  which <i>Italy</i> enjoys are to the History-Painters, the Beautiful and
  noble Faces with which <i>England</i> is confessed to abound, are to
  Face-Painters; and besides we have the greatest number of the Works of
  the best Masters in that kind of any People, not without a competent
  number of those of the most excellent in every other part of Painting.
  And for Encouragement, the Wealth and Generosity of the <i>English</i>
  Nation affords that in such a degree, as Artists have no reason to
  complain.<br>
<br>
  'And accordingly in Fact, Face-Painting is no where so well performed
  as in <i>England:</i> I know not whether it has lain in your way to observe
  it, but I have, and pretend to be a tolerable Judge. I have seen what
  is done abroad, and can assure you, that the Honour of that Branch of
  Painting is justly due to us. I appeal to the judicious Observers for
  the Truth of what I assert. If Foreigners have oftentimes or even for
  the most part excelled our Natives, it ought to be imputed to the
  Advantages they have met with <i>here</i>, join'd to their own Ingenuity
  and Industry; nor has any one Nation distinguished themselves so as to
  raise an Argument in favour of their Country: but it is to be
  observed, that neither <i>French</i> nor <i>Italians</i>, nor any one of either
  Nation, notwithstanding all our Prejudices in their favour have, or
  ever had, for any considerable time, any Character among us as
  Face-Painters.<br>
<br>
  'This Honour is due to our own Country; and has been so for near an
  Age: So that instead of going to <i>Italy</i>, or elsewhere, one that
  designs for Portrait-Painting ought to study in <i>England.</i> Hither such
  should come from <i>Holland, France, Italy, Germany</i>, &amp;c. as he that
  intends to practice any other kind of Painting, should go to those
  Parts where 'tis in greatest Perfection. 'Tis said the Blessed Virgin
  descended from Heaven, to sit to St <i>Luke</i>; I dare venture to affirm,
  that if she should de<b>Sir</b> e another <i>Madonna</i> to be painted by the Life,
  she would come to <i>England</i>; and am of opinion that your present
  President, <b>Sir</b>  <i>Godfrey Kneller</i>, from his Improvement since he
  arrived in this Kingdom, would perform that Office better than any
  Foreigner living. I am, with all possible Respect,<br>
<br>
<i><b>Sir</b> <br>
Your most Humble, and<br>
Most Obedient Servant, &amp;c.</i></blockquote><br>

<a name="ded2"></a><h2>Dedication of the Eighth Volume of <i>The Spectator</i></h2><br>

<i><a name="frd2">To</a><b>William Honeycomb Esq.</b><a href="#fd2"><sup>1</sup></a>.</i><br>
<br>
The Seven former Volumes of the <i>Spectator</i> having been Dedicated to
some of the most celebrated Persons of the Age, I take leave to Inscribe
this Eighth and Last to You, as to a Gentleman who hath ever been
ambitious of appearing in the best Company.<br>
<br>
You are now wholly retired from the busie Part of Mankind, and at
leisure to reflect upon your past Achievements; for which reason, I look
upon You as a Person very well qualified for a Dedication.<br>
<br>
I may possibly disappoint my Readers, and your self too, if I do not
endeavour on this Occasion to make the World acquainted with your
Virtues. And here, <b>Sir</b> , I shall not compliment You upon your Birth,
Person, or Fortune; nor any other the like Perfections, which You
possess whether You will or no: But shall only touch upon those, which
are of your own acquiring, and in which every one must allow You have a
real Merit.<br>
<br>
Your janty Air and easy Motion, the Volubility of your Discourse, the
Suddenness of your Laugh, the Management of your Snuff-Box, with the
Whiteness of your Hands and Teeth (which have justly gained You the Envy
of the most polite part of the Male World, and the Love of the greatest
Beauties in the Female) are intirely to be ascribed to your own personal
Genius and Application.<br>
<br>
You are formed for these Accomplishments by a happy Turn of Nature, and
have finished your self in them by the utmost Improvements of Art. A Man
that is defective in either of these Qualifications (whatever may be the
secret Ambition of his Heart) must never hope to make the Figure You
have done, among the fashionable part of his Species. It is therefore no
wonder, we see such Multitudes of aspiring young Men fall short of You
in all these Beauties of your Character, notwithstanding the Study and
Practice of them is the whole Business of their Lives. But I need not
tell You that the free and disengaged Behaviour of a fine Gentleman
makes as many aukward Beaux, as the Easiness of your Favourite <i>Waller</i>
hath made insipid Poets.<br>
<br>
At present You are content to aim all your Charms at your own Spouse,
without further Thought of Mischief to any others of the Sex. I know you
had formerly a very great Contempt for that Pedantick Race of Mortals
who call themselves Philosophers; and yet, to your Honour be it spoken,
there is not a Sage of them all could have better acted up to their
Precepts in one of the most important Points of Life: I mean in that
Generous Dis-regard of Popular Opinion, which you showed some Years ago,
when you chose for your Wife an obscure young Woman, who doth not indeed
pretend to an ancient Family, but has certainly as many Fore-fathers as
any Lady in the Land, if she could but reckon up their Names.<br>
<br>
I must own I conceived very extraordinary hopes of you from the Moment
that you confessed your Age, and from eight and forty (where you had
stuck so many Years) very ingenuously step'd into your Grand
Climacterick. Your Deportment has since been very venerable and
becoming. If I am rightly informed, You make a regular Appearance every
Quarter-Sessions among your Brothers of the <i>Quorum</i>; and if things go
on as they do, stand fair for being a Colonel of the Militia. I am told
that your Time passes away as agreeably in the Amusements of a Country
Life, as it ever did in the Gallantries of the Town: And that you now
take as much pleasure in the Planting of young Trees, as you did
formerly in the Cutting down of your Old ones. In short, we hear from
all Hands that You are thoroughly reconciled to your dirty Acres, and
have not too much Wit to look into your own Estate.<br>
<br>
After having spoken thus much of my Patron, I must take the Privilege of
an Author in saying something of my self. I shall therefore beg leave to
add, that I have purposely omitted setting those Marks to the End of
every Paper, which appeared in my former Volumes, that You may have an
Opportunity of showing Mrs. <i>Honeycomb</i> the Shrewdness of your
Conjectures, by ascribing every Speculation to its proper Author: Though
You know how often many profound Criticks in Style and Sentiments have
very judiciously erred in this Particular, before they were let into the
Secret. I am,<br>
<br>
<i><b>Sir</b> ,<br>
Your most Faithful,<br>
Humble Servant,<br>

<br>

Upon laying down the Office of SPECTATOR, I acquainted the World with my
Design of electing a new Club, and of opening my Mouth in it after a
most solemn Manner. Both the Election and the Ceremony are now past; but
not finding it so easy as I at first imagined, to break thro' a Fifty
Years Silence, I would not venture into the World under the character of
a Man who pretends to talk like other People, till I had arrived at a
full Freedom of Speech.<br>
<br>
I shall reserve for another time the History of such Club or Clubs of
which I am now a Talkative, but unworthy Member; and shall here give an
Account of this surprising Change which has been produced in me, and
which I look upon to be as remarkable an Accident as any recorded in
History, since that which happened to the Son of <i>Croesus</i>, after having
been many Years as much Tongue-tied as my self.<br>
<br>
Upon the first opening of my Mouth, I made a Speech consisting of about
half a Dozen well-turned Periods; but grew so very hoarse upon it, that
for three Days together, instead of finding the use of my Tongue, I was
afraid that I had quite lost it. Besides, the unusual Extension of my
Muscles on this Occasion, made my Face ake on both Sides to such a
Degree, that nothing but an invincible Resolution and Perseverance could
have prevented me from falling back to my Monosyllables. I afterwards
made several Essays towards speaking; and that I might not be startled
at my own Voice, which has happen'd to me more than once, I used to read
aloud in my Chamber, and have often stood in the Middle of the Street to
call a Coach, when I knew there was none within hearing.<br>
<br>
When I was thus grown pretty well acquainted with my own Voice, I laid
hold of all Opportunities to exert it. Not caring however to speak much
by my self, and to draw upon me the whole Attention of those I conversed
with, I used, for some time, to walk every Morning in the <i>Mall</i>, and
talk in Chorus with a Parcel of <i>Frenchmen.</i> I found my Modesty greatly
relieved by the communicative Temper of this Nation, who are so very
sociable, as to think they are never better Company, than when they are
all opening at the same time.<br>
<br>
I then fancied I might receive great Benefit from Female Conversation,
and that I should have a Convenience of talking with the greater
Freedom, when I was not under any Impediment of thinking: I therefore
threw my self into an Assembly of Ladies, but could not for my Life get
in a Word among them; and found that if I did not change my Company, I
was in Danger of being reduced to my primitive Taciturnity.<br>
<br>
The Coffee-houses have ever since been my chief Places of Resort, where
I have made the greatest Improvements; in order to which I have taken a
particular Care never to be of the same Opinion with the Man I conversed
with. I was a Tory at <i>Button's</i>, and a Whig at <i>Childe's</i>; a Friend to
the <i>Englishman</i>, or an Advocate for the <i>Examiner</i>, as it best served
my Turn; some fancy me a great Enemy to the <i>French</i> King, though, in
reality, I only make use of him for a Help to Discourse. In short, I
wrangle and dispute for Exercise; and have carried this Point so far
that I was once like to have been run through the Body for making a
little too free with my Betters.<br>
<br>
In a Word, I am quite another Man to what I was.

<blockquote><i>&mdash;Nil fuit unquam<br>
Tam dispar sibi&mdash;</i></blockquote>

My old Acquaintance scarce know me; nay I was asked the other Day by a
<i>Jew</i> at <i>Jonathan's</i>, whether I was not related to a dumb Gentleman,
who used to come to that Coffee-house? But I think I^never was better
pleased in my Life than about a Week ago, when, as I was battling it
across the Table with a young Templar, his Companion gave him a Pull by
the Sleeve, begging him to come away, for that the old Prig would talk
him to Death.<br>
<br>
Being now a very good Proficient in Discourse, I shall appear in the
World with this Addition to my Character, that my Countrymen may reap
the Fruits of my new-acquired Loquacity.<br>
<br>
Those who have been present at public Disputes in the University, know
that it is usual to maintain Heresies for Argument's sake. I have heard
a Man a most impudent Socinian for Half an Hour, who has been an
Orthodox Divine all his Life after. I have taken the same Method to
accomplish my self in the Gift of Utterance, having talked above a
Twelve-month, not so much for the Benefit of my Hearers as of my self.
But since I have now gained the Faculty, I have been so long
endeavouring after, I intend to make a right Use of it, and shall think
my self obliged, for the future, to speak always in Truth and Sincerity
of Heart. While a Man is learning to fence, he practises both on Friend
and Foe; but when he is a Master in the Art, he never exerts it but on
what he thinks the right Side.<br>
<br>
That this last Allusion may not give my Reader a wrong Idea of my Design
in this Paper, I must here inform him, that the Author of it is of no
Faction, that he is a Friend to no Interests but those of Truth and
Virtue, nor a Foe to any but those of Vice and Folly. Though I make more
Noise in the World than I used to do, I am still resolved to act in it
as an indifferent SPECTATOR. It is not my Ambition to encrease the
Number either of Whigs or Tories, but of wise and good Men, and I could
heartily wish there were not Faults common to both Parties which afford
me sufficient Matter to work upon, without descending to those which are
peculiar to either.<br>
<br>
If in a Multitude of Counsellors there is Safety, we ought to think our
selves the securest Nation in the World. Most of our Garrets are
inhabited by Statesmen, who watch over the Liberties of their Country,
and make a Shift to keep themselves from starving by taking into their
Care the Properties of their Fellow-Subjects.<br>
<br>
As these Politicians of both Sides have already worked the Nation into a
most unnatural Ferment, I shall be so far from endeavouring to raise it
to a greater Height, that on the contrary, it shall be the chief
Tendency of my Papers, to inspire my Countrymen with a mutual Good-will
and Benevolence. Whatever Faults either Party may be guilty of, they are
rather inflamed than cured by those Reproaches, which they cast upon one
another. The most likely Method of rectifying any Man's Conduct, is, by
recommending to him the Principles of Truth and Honour, Religion and
Virtue; and so long as he acts with an Eye to these Principles, whatever
Party he is of, he cannot fail of being a good <i>Englishman</i>, and a Lover
of his Country.<br>
<br>
As for the Persons concerned in this Work, the Names of all of them, or
at least of such as de<b>Sir</b> e it, shall be published hereafter: Till which
time I must entreat the courteous Reader to suspend his Curiosity, and
rather to consider what is written, than who they are that write it.<br>
<br>
Having thus adjusted all necessary Preliminaries with my Reader, I shall
not trouble him with any more prefatory Discourses, but proceed in my
old Method, and entertain him with Speculations on every useful Subject
that falls in my Way.<br>

<br>

<i>There is nothing, says Plato, so delightful, as the hearing or the
speaking of Truth</i>. For this Reason there is no Conversation so
agreeable as that of the Man of Integrity, who hears without any
Intention to betray, and speaks without any Intention to deceive.<br>
<br>
Among all the Accounts which are given of <i>Cato</i>, I do not remember one
that more redounds to his Honour than the following Passage related by
<i>Plutarch.</i> As an Advocate was pleading the Cause of his Client before
one of the Pr&aelig;tors, he could only produce a single Witness in a Point
where the Law required the Testimony of two Persons; upon which the
Advocate insisted on the Integrity of that Person whom he had produced:
but the Pr&aelig;tor told him, That where the Law required two Witnesses he
would not accept of one, tho' it were <i>Cato</i> himself. Such a Speech from
a Person who sat at the Head of a Court of Justice, while <i>Cato</i> was
still living, shews us, more than a thousand Examples, the high
Reputation this great Man had gained among his Contemporaries upon the
Account of his Sincerity.<br>
<br>
When such an inflexible Integrity is a little softened and qualified by
the Rules of Conversation and Good-breeding, there is not a more shining
Virtue in the whole Catalogue of Social Duties. A Man however ought to
take great Care not to polish himself out of his Veracity, nor to refine
his Behaviour to the Prejudice of his Virtue.<br>
<br>
<a name="fr5571">This</a> Subject is exquisitely treated in the most elegant Sermon of the
great <i>British</i> Preacher<a href="#f5571"><sup>1</sup></a>. I shall beg Leave to transcribe out of it
two or three Sentences, as a proper Introduction to a very curious
Letter, which I shall make the chief Entertainment of this Speculation.

<blockquote>  'The old <i>English</i> Plainness and Sincerity, that generous Integrity of
  Nature, and Honesty of Disposition, which always argues true Greatness
  of Mind, and is usually accompanied with undaunted Courage and
  Resolution, is in a great Measure lost among us.<br>
<br>
  'The Dialect of Conversation is now-a-days so swelled with Vanity and
  Compliment, and so surfeited (as I may say) of Expressions of Kindness
  and Respect, that if a Man that lived an Age or two ago should return
  into the World again, he would really want a Dictionary to help him to
  understand his own Language, and to know the true intrinsick Value of
  the Phrase in Fashion; and would hardly, at first, believe at what a
  low Rate the highest Strains and Expressions of Kindness imaginable do
  commonly pass in current Payment; and when he should come to
  understand it, it would be a great while before he could bring himself
  with a good Countenance and a good Conscience, to converse with Men
  upon equal Terms and in their own Way.'</blockquote>

I have by me a Letter which I look upon as a great Curiosity, and which
may serve as an Exemplification to the foregoing Passage, cited out of
this most excellent Prelate. It is <a name="fr5572">said</a> to have been written in King
<i>Charles</i> II.'s Reign by the Ambassador of <i>Bantam</i><a href="#f5572"><sup>2</sup></a>, a little after
his Arrival in <i>England.</i><br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <i>Master</i>,<br>
<br>
  'The People, where I now am, have Tongues further from their Hearts
  than from <i>London</i> to <i>Bantam</i>, and thou knowest the Inhabitants of
  one of these Places does not know what is done in the other. They call
  thee and thy Subjects Barbarians, because we speak what we mean; and
  account themselves a civilized People, because they speak one thing
  and mean another: Truth they call Barbarity, and Falsehood Politeness.
  Upon my first landing, one who was sent from the King of this Place to
  meet me told me, <i>That he was extremely sorry for the Storm I had met
  with just before my Arrival</i>. I was troubled to hear him grieve and
  afflict himself upon my Account; but in less than a Quarter of an Hour
  he smiled, and was as merry as if nothing had happened. Another who
  came with him told me by my Interpreter, <i>He should be glad to do me
  any Service that lay in his Power</i>. Upon which I de<b>Sir</b> 'd him to carry
  one of my Portmantaus for me, but instead of serving me according to
  his Promise, he laughed, and bid another do it. I lodged, the first
  Week, at the House of one, who de<b>Sir</b> ed me <i>to think my self at home,
  and to consider his House as my own</i>. Accordingly, I the next Morning
  began to knock down one of the Walls of it, in order to let in the
  fresh Air, and had packed up some of the Houshold-Goods, of which I
  intended to have made thee a Present: But the false Varlet no sooner
  saw me falling to Work, but he sent Word to de<b>Sir</b> e me to give over,
  for that he would have no such Doings in his House. I had not been
  long in this Nation, before I was told by one, for whom I had asked a
  certain Favour from the Chief of the King's Servants, whom they here
  call the Lord-Treasurer, That I had <i>eternally obliged him</i>. I was so
  surpriz'd at his Gratitude, that I could not forbear saying, What
  Service is there which one Man can do for another, that can oblige him
  to all Eternity! However I only asked him, for my Reward, that he
  would lend me his eldest Daughter during my Stay in this Country; but
  I quickly found that he was as treacherous as the rest of his
  Countrymen.<br>
<br>
  'At my first going to Court, one of the great Men almost put me out of
  Countenance, by asking <i>ten thousand Pardons</i> of me for only treading
  by Accident upon my Toe. They call this kind of Lye a Compliment; for
  when they are Civil to a great Man, they tell him Untruths, for which
  thou wouldst order any of thy Officers of State to receive a hundred
  Blows upon his Foot. I do not know how I shall negociate any thing
  with this People, since there is so little Credit to be given to 'em.
  When I go to see the King's Scribe, I am generally told that he is not
  at home, tho' perhaps I saw him go into his House almost the very
  Moment before. Thou wouldest fancy that the whole Nation are
  Physicians, for the first Question they always ask me, is, <i>how I do</i>:
  I have this Question put to me above a hundred times a Day. Nay, they
  are not only thus inquisitive after my Health, but wish it in a more
  solemn Manner, with a full Glass in their Hands, every time I sit with
  them at Table, tho' at the same time they would perswade me to drink
  their Liquors in such Quantities as I have found by Experience will
  make me sick. They often pretend to pray for thy Health also in the
  same Manner; but I have more Reason to expect it from the Goodness of
  thy Constitution, than the Sincerity of their Wishes. May thy Slave
  escape in Safety from this doubled-tongued Race of Men, and live to
  lay himself once more at thy Feet in thy Royal City of <i>Bantam.</i>'</blockquote><br>

<br>

It is a celebrated Thought of <i>Socrates</i>, that if all the Misfortunes of
Mankind were cast into a publick Stock, in order to be equally
distributed among the whole Species, those who now think themselves the
most unhappy, would prefer the Share they are already possess'd of,
before that which would fall to them by such a Division. <i>Horace</i> has
carried this Thought a great deal further in the Motto of my Paper,
which implies that the Hardships or Misfortunes we lye under, are more
easy to us than those of any other Person would be, in case we could
change Conditions with him.<br>
<br>
As I was ruminating on these two Remarks, and seated in my Elbow-Chair,
I insensibly fell asleep; when, on a sudden, methought there was a
Proclamation made by <i>Jupiter</i>, that every Mortal should bring in his
Griefs and Calamities, and throw them together in a Heap. There was a
large Plain appointed for this Purpose. I took my Stand in the Center of
it, and saw with a great deal of Pleasure the whole human Species
marching one after another and throwing down their several Loads, which
immediately grew up into a prodigious Mountain that seemed to rise above
the Clouds.<br>
<br>
There was a certain Lady of a thin airy Shape, who was very active in
this Solemnity. She carried a magnifying Glass in one of her Hands, and
was cloathed in a loose flowing Robe, embroidered with several Figures
of Fiends and Spectres, that discovered themselves in a Thousand
chimerical Shapes, as her Garment hovered in the Wind. There was
something wild and distracted in her Look. Her Name was <b><i>Fancy.</i></b> She led
up every Mortal to the appointed Place, after having very officiously
assisted him in making up his Pack, and laying it upon his Shoulders. My
Heart melted within me to see my Fellow-Creatures groaning under their
respective Burthens, and to consider that prodigious Bulk of human
Calamities which lay before me.<br>
<br>
There were however several Persons who gave me great Diversion upon this
Occasion. I observed one bringing in a Fardel very carefully concealed
under an old embroidered Cloak, which, upon his throwing it into the
Heap, I discovered to be Poverty. Another, after a great deal of
puffing, threw down his Luggage; which, upon examining, I found to be
his Wife.<br>
<br>
There were Multitudes of Lovers saddled with very whimsical Burthens
composed of Darts and Flames; but, what was very odd, tho' they sighed
as if their Hearts would break under these Bundles of Calamities, they
could not perswade themselves to cast them into the Heap when they came
up to it; but after a few faint efforts, shook their Heads and marched
away as heavy loaden as they came. I saw Multitudes of old Women throw
down their Wrinkles, and several young ones who stripped themselves of a
tawny Skin. There were very great Heaps of red Noses, large Lips, and
rusty Teeth. The Truth of it is, I was surpriz'd to see the greatest
Part of the Mountain made up of bodily Deformities. Observing one
advancing towards the Heap with a larger Cargo than ordinary upon his
Back, I found upon his near Approach, that it was only a natural Hump,
which he disposed of with great Joy of Heart among this Collection of
humane Miseries. There were likewise Distempers of all Sorts, tho' I
could not but observe, that there were many more Imaginary than real.
One little Packet I could not but take Notice of, which was a
Complication of all the Diseases incident to humane Nature, and was in
the Hand of a great many fine People: This was called the Spleen. But
what most of all surprized me, was a Remark I made, that there was not a
single [illegible] Folly thrown into the whole Heap: At which I was very
much astonished, having concluded within my self, that every one would
take this Opportunity of getting rid of his Passions, Prejudices, and
Frailties.<br>
<br>
I took Notice in particular of a very profligate Fellow, who I did not
Question came loaden with his Crimes, but upon searching into his
Bundle, I found that instead of throwing his Guilt from him, he had only
laid down his Memory. He was followed by another worthless Rogue who
flung away his Modesty instead of his Ignorance.<br>
<br>
When the whole Race of Mankind had thus cast their Burthens, the
<i>Phantome</i> which had been so busie on this Occasion, seeing me an idle
<b>Spectator</b> of what passed, approached towards me. I grew uneasy at her
Presence, when of a sudden she held her magnifying Glass full before my
Eyes. I no sooner saw my Face in it, but was startled at the Shortness
of it, which now appeared to me in its utmost Aggravation. The
immoderate Breadth of the Features made me very much out of Humour with
my own Countenance, upon which I threw it from me like a Mask. It
happened very luckily, that one who stood by me had just before thrown
down his Visage, which, it seems, was too long for him. It was indeed
extended to a most shameful length; I believe the very Chin was,
modestly speaking, as long as my whole Face. We had both of us an
Opportunity of mending our selves, and all the Contributions being now
brought in, every Man was at Liberty to exchange his Misfortune for
those of another Person. But as there arose many new Incidents in the
Sequel of my Vision, I shall reserve them for the Subject of my next
Paper.<br>

<blockquote><i>Quid caus&aelig; est, merit&ograve; quin illis Jupiter ambas<br>
Iratus buccas inflet: neque se fore posthac<br>
Tam facilem dicat, votis ut pr&aelig;beat aurem?</i><br>

<br>

In my last Paper, I gave my Reader a Sight of that Mountain of Miseries,
which was made up of those several Calamities that afflict the Minds of
Men. I saw, with unspeakable Pleasure, the whole Species thus delivered
from its Sorrows: though at the same time, as we stood round the Heap,
and surveyed the several Materials of which it was composed, there was
scarce a Mortal in this vast Multitude who did not discover what he
thought Pleasures and Blessings of Life; and wondered how the Owners of
them ever came to look upon them as Burthens and Grievances.<br>
<br>
As we were regarding very attentively this Confusion of Miseries, this
Chaos of Calamity, <i>Jupiter</i> issued out a second Proclamation, that
every one was now at Liberty to exchange his Affliction, and to return
to his Habitation with any such other Bundle as should be delivered to
him.<br>
<br>
Upon this, <b><i>Fancy</i></b> began again to bestir her self, and parcelling out
the whole Heap with incredible Activity, recommended to every one his
particular Packet. The Hurry and Confusion at this time was not to be
expressed. Some Observations, which I made upon the Occasion, I shall
communicate to the Publick. A venerable grey-headed Man, who had laid
down the Cholick, and who I found wanted an Heir to his Estate, snatched
up an undutiful Son that had been thrown into the Heap by his angry
Father. The graceless Youth, in less than a quarter of an Hour, pulled
the old Gentleman by the Beard, and had like to have knocked his Brains
out; so that meeting the true Father, who came towards him in a Fit of
the Gripes, he begg'd him to take his Son again, and give him back his
Cholick; but they were incapable either of them to recede from the
Choice they had made. A poor Gally-Slave, who had thrown down his
Chains, took up the Gout in their stead, but made such wry Faces, that
one might easily perceive he was no great Gainer by the Bargain. It was
pleasant enough to see the several Exchanges that were made, for
Sickness against Poverty, Hunger against want of Appetite, and Care
against Pain.<br>
<br>
The Female World were very busie among themselves in bartering for
Features; one was trucking a Lock of grey Hairs for a Carbuncle, another
was making over a short Waste for a Pair of round Shoulders, and a third
cheapning a bad Face for a lost Reputation: But on all these Occasions,
there was not one of them who did not think the new Blemish, as soon as
she had got it into her Possession, much more disagreeable than the old
one. I made the same Observation on every other Misfortune or Calamity,
which every one in the Assembly brought upon himself, in lieu of what he
had parted with; whether it be that all the Evils which befall us are in
some Measure suited and proportioned to our Strength, or that every Evil
becomes more supportable by our being accustomed to it, I shall not
determine.<br>
<br>
I could not for my Heart forbear pitying the poor hump-back'd Gentleman
mentioned in the former Paper, who went off a very well-shaped Person
with a Stone in his Bladder; nor the fine Gentleman who had struck up
this Bargain with him, that limped thro' a whole Assembly of Ladies, who
used to admire him, with a Pair of Shoulders peeping over his Head.<br>
<br>
I must not omit my own particular Adventure. My Friend with the long
Visage had no sooner taken upon him my short Face, but he made such a
grotesque Figure in it, that as I looked upon him I could not forbear
laughing at my self, insomuch that I put my own Face out of Countenance.
The poor Gentleman was so sensible of the Ridicule, that I found he was
ashamed of what he had done: On the other Side I found that I my self
had no great Reason to triumph, for as I went to touch my Forehead I
missed the Place, and clapped my Finger upon my upper Lip. Besides, as
my Nose was exceeding Prominent, I gave it two or three unlucky Knocks
as I was playing my Hand about my Face, and aiming at some other Part of
it. I saw two other Gentlemen by me, who were in the same ridiculous
Circumstances. These had made a foolish Swop between a Couple of thick
bandy Legs, and two long Trapsticks that had no Calfs to them. One of
these looked like a Man walking upon Stilts, and was so lifted up into
the Air above his ordinary Height, that his Head turned round with it,
while the other made such awkward Circles, as he attempted to walk, that
he scarce knew how to move forward upon his new Supporters: Observing
him to be a pleasant Kind of Fellow, I stuck my Cane in the Ground, and
told him I would lay him a Bottle of Wine, that he did not march up to
it on a Line, that I drew for him, in a Quarter of an Hour.<br>
<br>
The Heap was at last distributed among the two Sexes, who made a most
piteous Sight, as they wandered up and down under the Pressure of their
several Burthens. The whole Plain was filled with Murmurs and
Complaints, Groans and Lamentations. <i>Jupiter</i> at length, taking
Compassion on the poor Mortals, ordered them a second time to lay down
their Loads, with a Design to give every one his own again. They
discharged themselves with a great deal of Pleasure, after which, the
Phantome, who had led them into such gross Delusions, was commanded to
disappear. There was sent in her stead a Goddess of a quite different
Figure: Her Motions were steady and composed, and her Aspect serious but
cheerful. She every now and then cast her Eyes towards Heaven, and fixed
them upon <i>Jupiter:</i> Her name was <b><i>Patience.</i></b> She had no sooner placed
her self by the Mount of Sorrows, but, what I thought very remarkable,
the whole Heap sunk to such a Degree, that it did not appear a third
part so big as it was before. She afterwards returned every Man his own
proper Calamity, and teaching him how to bear it in the most commodious
Manner, he marched off with it contentedly, being very well pleased that
he had not been left to his own Choice, as to the kind of Evils which
fell to his Lot.<br>
<br>
Besides the several Pieces of Morality to be drawn out of this Vision, I
learnt from it, never to repine at my own Misfortunes, or to envy the
Happiness of another, since it is impossible for any Man to form a right
Judgment of his Neighbour's Sufferings; for which Reason also I have
determined never to think too lightly of another's Complaints, but to
regard the Sorrows of my Fellow Creatures with Sentiments of Humanity
and Compassion.<br>

Every one has heard of the Famous Conjurer, who, according to the
Opinion of the Vulgar, has studied himself <i>dumb</i>; for which Reason, as
it is believed, he delivers out all his Oracles in Writing. Be that as
it will, the blind <i>Tiresias</i> was not more famous in <i>Greece</i>, than this
dumb Artist has been, for some Years last past, in the Cities of
<i>London</i> and <i>Westminster.</i> Thus much for the profound Gentleman who
honours me with the following Epistle.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <i>From my Cell</i>, June 24, 1714.<br>
<br>
  <i><b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  'Being informed that you have lately got the Use of your Tongue, I
  have some Thoughts of following your Example, that I may be a
  <i>Fortune-teller</i> properly speaking. I am grown weary of my
  Taciturnity, and having served my Country many Years under the Title
  of the dumb Doctor, I shall now prophesie by Word of Mouth, and (as
  Mr. <i>Lee</i> says of the Magpie, who you know was a great Fortune-teller
  among the Ancients) <i>chatter</i> Futurity. I have hitherto chosen to
  receive Questions and return Answers in Writing, that I might avoid
  the Tediousness and Trouble of Debates, my Querists being generally of
  a Humour to think, that they have never Predictions enough for their
  Mony. In short, <b>Sir</b> , my Case has been something like that of those
  discreet Animals the Monkeys, who, as the <i>Indians</i> tell us, can speak
  if they would, but purposely avoid it that they may not be made to
  work. I have hitherto gained a Livelyhood by holding my Tongue, but
  shall now open my Mouth in order to fill it. If I appear a little
  Word-bound in my first Solutions and Responses, I hope it will not be
  imputed to any Want of Foresight, but to the long Disuse of Speech. I
  doubt not by this Invention to have all my former Customers over
  again, for if I have promised any of them Lovers or Husbands, Riches
  or good Luck, it is my Design to confirm to them <i>viv&acirc; voce</i>, what I
  have already given them under my Hand. If you will honour me with a
  Visit, I will compliment you with the first opening of my Mouth, and
  if you please you may make an entertaining Dialogue out of the
  Conversation of two dumb Men. Excuse this Trouble, worthy <b>Sir</b> , from
  one who has been a long time<br>

  Club, and am ordered by the whole Sisterhood, to congratulate you upon
  the Use of your Tongue. We have all of us a mighty Mind to hear you

from my Correspondents, I shall fill up the remaining Part of it with
other congratulatory Letters of the same Nature.<br>

  <b>Sir</b> ,<br>
<br>
  'I am a tall, broad-shoulder'd, impudent, black Fellow, and, as I
  thought, every way qualified for a rich Widow: But, after having tried
  my Fortune for above three Years together, I have not been able to get
  one single Relict in the Mind. My first Attacks were generally
  successful, but always broke off as soon as they came to the Word
  <i>Settlement.</i> Though I have not improved my Fortune this way, I have
  my Experience, and have learnt several Secrets which may be of use to
  those unhappy Gentlemen, who are commonly distinguished by the Name of
  Widow-hunters, and who do not know that this Tribe of Women are,
  generally speaking, as much upon the Catch as themselves. I shall here
  communicate to you the Mysteries of a certain Female Cabal of this
  Order, who call themselves the <i>Widow-Club.</i> This Club consists of
  nine experienced Dames, who take their Places once a Week round a
  large oval Table.
<ol type="I">
  <li>Mrs. President is a Person who has disposed of six Husbands, and is
  now determined to take a seventh; being of Opinion that there is as
  much Vertue in the Touch of a seventh Husband as of a seventh Son. Her
  Comrades are as follow.</li></ol>
<ol type="I" start=2>
  <li>Mrs. <i>Snapp</i>, who has four Jointures, by four different
  Bed-fellows, of four different Shires. She is at present upon the
  Point of Marriage with a <i>Middlesex</i> Man, and is said to have an
  Ambition of extending her Possessions through all the Counties in
  <i>England</i> on this Side the <i>Trent.</i></li></ol>
<ol type="I" start=3>
  <li>Mrs. <i>Medlar</i>, who after two Husbands and a Gallant, is now
  wedded to an old Gentleman of Sixty. Upon her making her Report to the
  Club after a Weeks Cohabitation, she is still allowed to sit as a
  Widow, and accordingly takes her Place at the Board.</li></ol>
<ol type="I" start=4>
  <li>The Widow <i>Quick</i>, married within a Fortnight after the Death of
  her last Husband. Her <i>Weeds</i> have served her thrice, and are still as
  good as new.</li></ol>
<ol type="I" start=5>
  <li>Lady <i>Catherine Swallow</i>. She was a Widow at Eighteen, and has
  since buried a second Husband and two Coachmen.</li></ol>
<ol type="I" start=6>
  <li>The Lady <i>Waddle.</i> She was married in the 15th Year of her Age to
  <b>Sir</b>  <i>Simon Waddle</i>, Knight, aged Threescore and Twelve, by whom she
  had Twinns nine Months after his Decease. In the 55th Year of her Age
  she was married to <i>James Spindle</i>, Esq.; a Youth of One and Twenty,
  who did not out-live the Honey-Moon.</li></ol>
<ol type="I" start=7>
  <li><i>Deborah Conquest</i>. The Case of this Lady is something
  particular. She is the Relict of <i><b>Sir</b>  Sampson Conquest</i>, some time
  Justice of the <i>Quorum.</i> <b>Sir</b>  <i>Sampson</i> was seven Foot high, and two
  Foot in Breadth from the Tip of one Shoulder to the other. He had
  married three Wives, who all of them died in Child-bed. This terrified
  the whole Sex, who none of them durst venture on <b>Sir</b>  <i>Sampson.</i> At
  length Mrs. <i>Deborah</i> undertook him, and gave so good an Account of
  him, that in three Years time she very fairly laid him out, and
  measured his Length upon the Ground. This Exploit has gained her so
  great a Reputation in the Club, that they have added <b>Sir</b>  <i>Sampson's</i>
  three Victories to hers, and give her the Merit of a fourth Widowhood;
  and she takes her Place accordingly.</li></ol>
<ol type="I" start=8>
  <li>The Widow <i>Wildfire</i>, Relict of Mr. <i>John Wildfire</i>,
  Fox-hunter, who broke his Neck over a six Bar Gate. She took his Death
  so much to Heart, that it was thought it would have put an End to her
  Life, had she not diverted her Sorrows by receiving the Addresses of a
  Gentleman in the Neighbourhood, who made Love to her in the second
  Month of her Widowhood. This Gentleman was discarded in a Fortnight
  for the sake of a young <i>Templar</i>, who had the Possession of her for
  six Weeks after, till he was beaten out by a broken Officer, who
  likewise gave up his Place to a Gentleman at Court. The Courtier was
  as short-liv'd a Favourite as his Predecessors, but had the Pleasure
  to see himself succeeded by a long Series of Lovers, who followed the
  Widow <i>Wildfire</i> to the 37th Year of her Age, at which time there
  ensued a Cessation of ten Years, when<i> John Felt</i>, Haberdasher, took
  it in his Head to be in love with her, and it is thought will very
  suddenly carry her off.</li></ol>
<ol type="I" start=9>
  <li>The last is pretty Mrs. <i>Runnet</i>, who broke her first Husband's
  Heart before she was Sixteen, at which Time she was entred of the
  Club, but soon after left it, upon Account of a Second, whom she made
  so quick a Dispatch of, that she returned to her Seat in less than a
  Twelvemonth. This young Matron is looked upon as the most rising
  Member of the Society, and will probably be in the President's Chair
  before she dies.</li></ol>

  'These Ladies, upon their first Institution, resolved to give the
  Pictures of their deceased Husbands to the Club-Room, but two of them
  bringing in their Dead at full Length, they cover'd all the Walls;
  Upon which they came to a second Resolution, that every Matron should
  give her own Picture, and set it round with her Husbands in Miniature.<br>
<br>
  As they have most of them the Misfortune to be troubled with the
  Cholick, they have a noble Celler of Cordials and strong Waters. When
  they grow Maudlin, they are very apt to commemorate their former
  Partners with a Tear. But ask them which of their Husbands they
  Condole, they are not able to tell you, and discover plainly that they
  do not Weep so much for the Loss of a Husband, as for the want of One.<br>
<br>
  'The principal Rule, by which the whole Society are to govern
  themselves is this, To cry up the Pleasures of a single Life upon all
  Occasions, in order to deter the rest of their Sex from Marriage, and
  engross the whole Male World to themselves.<br>
<br>
  'They are obliged, when any one makes Love to a Member of the Society,
  to communicate his Name, at which Time the whole Assembly sit upon his
  Reputation, Person, Fortune, and good Humour; and if they find him
  qualified for a Sister of the Club, they lay their Heads together how
  to make him sure. By this Means they are acquainted with all the
  Widow-hunters about Town, who often afford them great Diversion. There
  is an honest <i>Irish</i> Gentleman, it seems, who knows nothing of this
  Society, but at different times has made Love to the whole Club.<br>
<br>
  Their Conversation often turns upon their former Husbands, and it is
  very diverting to hear them relate their several Arts and Stratagems,
  with which they amused the Jealous, pacified the Chokrick, or wheedled
  the Good-natured Man, till at last, to use the Club Phrase, <i>They sent
  him out of the House with his Heels foremost.</i><br>
<br>
  The Politicks, which are most cultivated by this Society of
  She-<i>Machiavils</i>, relate chiefly to these two Points: How to treat a
  Lover, and How to manage a Husband. As for the first Set of Artifices,
  they are too numerous to come within the Compass of your Paper, and
  shall therefore be reserved for a Second Letter.<br>
<br>
  The Management of a Husband is built upon the following Doctrines,
  which are Universally assented to by the whole Club. Not to give him
  his Head at first. Not to allow him too great Freedoms and
  Familiarities. Not to be treated by him like a raw Girl, but as a
  Woman that knows the World. Not to Lessen anything of her former
  Figure. To celebrate the Generosity, or any other Vertue, of a
  deceased Husband, which she would recommend to his Successor. To turn
  away all his old Friends and Servants, that she may have the Dear Man
  to her self. To make him disinherit the undutiful Children of any
  former Wife. Never to be thoroughly convinced of his Affection, till he
  has made over to her all his Goods and Chattels.<br>
<br>

<br>

<i>It <a name="fr5621">is</a> a hard and nice Subject for a Man to speak of himself,</i> says
Cowley<a href="#f5621"><sup>1</sup></a>; <i>it grates his own Heart to say anything of Disparagement,
and the Reader's Ears to hear any thing of Praise from him.</i> Let the
Tenour of his Discourse be what it will upon this Subject, it generally
proceeds from <i>Vanity.</i> An ostentatious Man will rather relate a Blunder
or an Absurdity he has committed, than be debarred from talking of his
own dear Person.<br>
<br>
Some very great Writers have been guilty of this Fault. It is observed
of <i>Tully</i> in particular, that his Works run very much in the First
Person, and that he takes all Occasions of doing himself Justice.

<blockquote>  'Does he think, says <i>Brutus</i>, that his Consulship deserves more
  Applause than my putting <i>C&aelig;sar</i> to Death, because I am not
  perpetually talking of the Ides of <i>March</i>, as he is of the Nones of
  <i>December</i>?'</blockquote>

I need not acquaint my learned Reader, that in the Ides of <i>March,
Brutus</i> destroyed <i>Caesar</i>, and that <i>Cicero</i> quashed the Conspiracy of
<i>Cataline</i> in the Calends of <i>December</i>. How shocking soever this great
Man's talking of himself might have been to his Contemporaries, I must
confess I am never better pleased than when he is on this Subject. Such
Openings of the Heart give a Man a thorough Insight into his Personal
Character, and illustrate several Passages in the History of his Life:
Besides that, there is some little Pleasure in discovering the Infirmity
of a great Man, and seeing how the Opinion he has of himself agrees with
what the World entertains of him.<br>
<br>
The Gentlemen of <i>Port-Royal</i>, who were more eminent for their Learning
and their Humility than any other in <i>France</i>, banish'd the way of
speaking in the First Person out of all their Works, as arising from
Vain-Glory and Self-Conceit. To shew their particular Aversion to it,
they branded this Form of Writing with the Name of an <i>Egotism</i>; a
Figure not to be found among the ancient Rhetoricians.<br>
<br>
The most violent Egotism which I have met with in the Course of my
Reading, is that of Cardinal <i>Wolsey, Ego et Rex meus, I and my King</i>;
as perhaps the most eminent Egotist that ever appeared in the World, was
<i>Montagne</i> the Author of the celebrated Essays. This lively old <i>Gascon</i>
has woven all his bodily Infirmities into his Works, and after having
spoken of the Faults or Virtues of any other Man, immediately publishes
to the World how it stands with himself in that Particular. Had he kept
his own Counsel he might have passed for a much better Man, though
perhaps he would not have been so diverting an Author. The Title of an
Essay promises perhaps a Discourse upon <i>Virgil</i> or <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>; but
when you look into it, you are sure to meet with more upon Monsieur
<i>Montagne</i>, than of either of them. The younger <i>Scaliger</i>, who seems to
have been no great Friend to this Author, after having acquainted the
World that his Father sold Herrings, adds these Words; 

<blockquote><i>La grande
fadaise de Montague, qui a escrit, qu'il aimoit mieux le vin blanc&mdash;que
diable a-t-on a faire de scavoir ce qu'il aime? For my Part, says
Montague, I am a great Lover of your White Wines&mdash;What the Devil
signifies it to the Publick, says Scaliger, whether he is a Lover of
White Wines or of Red Wines?</i></blockquote>

I cannot here forbear mentioning a Tribe of Egotists for whom I have
always had a mortal Aversion, I mean the Authors of Memoirs, who are
never mentioned in any Works but their own, and who raise all their
Productions out of this single Figure of Speech.<br>
<br>
Most of our modern Prefaces savour very strongly of the Egotism. Every
insignificant Author fancies it of Importance to the World, to know that
he writ his Book in the Country, that he did it to pass away some of his
idle Hours, that it was published at the Importunity of Friends, or that
his natural Temper, Studies or Conversations, directed him to the Choice
of his Subject.

<blockquote><i>&mdash;Id populus curat scilicet.</i></blockquote>

Such Informations cannot but be highly improving to the Reader.<br>
<br>
In Works of Humour, especially when a Man writes under a fictitious
Personage, the talking of one's self may give some Diversion to the
Publick; but I would advise every other Writer never to speak of
himself, unless there be something very considerable in his Character:
Tho' I am sensible this Rule will be of little Use in the World, because
there is no Man who fancies his Thoughts worth publishing, that does not
look upon himself as a considerable Person.<br>
<br>
I shall close this Paper with a Remark upon such as are Egotists in
Conversation: These are generally the vain or shallow part of Mankind,
People being naturally full of themselves when they have nothing else in
them. There is one kind of Egotists which is very common in the World,
tho' I do not remember that any Writer has taken Notice of them; I mean
those empty conceited Fellows, who repeat as Sayings of their own, or
some of their particular Friends, several Jests which were made before
they were born, and which every one who has conversed in the World has
heard a hundred times over. A forward young Fellow of my Acquaintance
was very guilty of this Absurdity: He would be always laying a new Scene
for some old Piece of Wit, and telling us, That as he and <i>Jack</i>
such-a-one were together, one or t'other of them had such a Conceit on
such an Occasion; upon which he would laugh very heartily, and wonder
the Company did not join with him. When his Mirth was over, I have often
reprehended him out of <i>Terence, Tuumne, obsecro te, hoc dictum erat?
vetus credidi</i>. But finding him still incorrigible, and having a
Kindness for the young Coxcomb, who was otherwise a good-natured Fellow,
I recommended to his Perusal the <i>Oxford</i> and <i>Cambridge</i> Jests, with
several little Pieces of Pleasantry of the same Nature. Upon the reading
of them, he was under no small Confusion to find that all his Jokes had
passed through several Editions, and that what he thought was a new
Conceit, and had appropriated to his own Use, had appeared in Print
before he or his ingenious Friends were ever heard of. This had so good
an Effect upon him, that he is content at present to pass for a Man of
plain Sense in his ordinary Conversation, and is never facetious but
when he knows his Company.<br>

I shall entertain my Reader with two very curious Letters. The first of
them comes from a chimerical Person, who I believe never writ to any
Body before.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <b>Sir</b> ,<br>
<br>
  'I am descended from the Ancient Family of the <i>Blanks</i>, a Name well
  known among all Men of Business. It is always read in those little
  white Spaces of Writing which want to be filled up, and which for that
  Reason are called <i>blank</i> Spaces, as of right appertaining to our
  Family: For I consider my self as the Lord of a Mannor, who lays his
  Claim to all Wastes or Spots of Ground that are unappropriated. I am a
  near Kinsman to <i>John a Styles</i> and <i>John a Nokes</i>; and they, I am
  told, came in with the Conquerour. I am mentioned oftner in both
  Houses of Parliament than any other Person in Great Britain. My Name
  is written, or more properly speaking, not written, thus, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. I am one that can turn my Hand to every thing, and appear under
  any Shape whatsoever. I can make my self Man, Woman, or Child. I am
  sometimes metamorphosed into a Year of our Lord, a Day of the Month,
  or an Hour of the Day. I very often represent a Sum of Mony, and am
  generally the first Subsidy that is granted to the Crown. I have now
  and then supplied the Place of several Thousands of Land Soldiers, and
  have as frequently been employed in the Sea Service.<br>
<br>
  'Now, <b>Sir</b> , my Complaint is this, that I am only made use of to serve a
  Turn, being always discarded as soon as a proper Person is found out
  to fill up my Place.<br>
<br>
  'If you have ever been in the Play-house before the Curtain rises, you
  see most of the Front Boxes filled with Men of my Family, who
  forthwith turn out and resign their Stations upon the Appearance of
  those for whom they are retained.<br>
<br>
  'But the most illustrious Branch of the <i>Blanks</i> are those who are
  planted in high Posts, till such time as Persons of greater
  Consequence can be found out to supply them. One of these <i>Blanks</i> is
  equally qualified for all Offices; he can serve in time of Need for a
  Soldier, a Politician, a Lawyer, or what you please. I have known in
  my Time many a Brother <i>Blank</i> that has been born under a lucky
  Planet, heap up great Riches, and swell into a Man of Figure and
  Importance, before the Grandees of his Party could agree among
  themselves which of them should step into his Place. Nay, I have known
  a <i>Blank</i> continue so long in one of these vacant Posts, (for such it
  is to be reckoned all the Time a <i>Blank</i> is in it) that he has grown
  too formidable and dangerous to be removed.<br>
<br>
  'But to return to my self, since I am so very commodious a Person, and
  so very necessary in all well-regulated Governments, I de<b>Sir</b> e you will
  take my Case into Consideration, that I may be no longer made a Tool
  of, and only employed to stop a Gap. Such Usage, without a Pun, makes
  me look very blank. For all which Reasons I humbly recommend my self
  to your Protection, and am <br>
<i>Your most obedient Servant,</i><br>
<br>
  'Blank.<br>
<br>
  <i>'P. S.</i> I herewith send you a Paper, drawn up by a Country Attorney
  employed by two Gentlemen, whose Names he was not acquainted with, and
  who did not think fit to let him into the Secret which they were
  transacting. I heard him call it a Blank Instrument, and read it after
  the following Manner. You may see by this single Instance of what Use
  I am to the busy World.

<blockquote>    '<i>I</i> T. Blank, <i>Esq., of</i> Blank <i>Town, in the County of</i> Blank, <i>do own my self indebted in the Sum of</i> Blank, <i>to Goodman</i> Blank, <i>for
    the Service he did me in procuring for me the Goods following,</i> Blank: <i>And I do hereby promise the said</i> Blank <i>to pay unto him the
    said Sum of</i> Blank, <i>on the</i> Blank <i>Day of the Month of</i> Blank <i>next
    ensuing, under the Penalty and Forfeiture of</i> Blank.

<br>
I shall take Time to consider the Case of this my imaginary
Correspondent, and in the mean while shall present my Reader with a
Letter which seems to come from a Person that is made up of Flesh and
Blood.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote> <i> Good Mr.</i> SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'I am married to a very honest Gentleman that is exceedingly
  good-natured, and at the same time very cholerick. There is no
  standing before him when he is in a Passion; but as soon as it is over
  he is the best-humour'd Creature in the World. When he is angry, he
  breaks all my China-Ware that chances to lie in his Way, and the next
  Morning sends me in twice as much as he broke the Day before. I may
  positively say, that he has broke me a Child's Fortune since we were
  first marry'd together.<br>
<br>
  'As soon as he begins to fret, down goes every thing that is within
  Reach of his Cane. I once prevailed upon him never to carry a Stick in
  his Hand, but this saved me nothing; for upon seeing me do something
  that did not please him, he kicked down a great Jarr, that cost him
  above Ten Pound but the Week before. I then laid the Fragments
  together in a Heap, and gave him his Cane again, de<b>Sir</b> ing him that if
  he chanced to be in Anger, he would spend his Passion upon the China
  that was broke to his Hand: But the very next Day upon my giving a
  wrong Message to one of the Servants, he flew into such a Rage, that
  he swept down a Dozen Tea-Dishes, which, to my Misfortune, stood very
  convenient for a Side-Blow.<br>
<br>
  I then removed all my China into a Room which he never frequents; but
  I got nothing by this neither, for my Looking-Glasses immediately went
  to Rack.<br>
<br>
  'In short, <b>Sir</b> , whenever he is in a Passion he is angry at every thing
  that is brittle; and if on such Occasions he had nothing to vent his
  Rage upon, I do not know whether my Bones would be in Safety. Let me
  beg of you, <b>Sir</b> , to let me know whether there be any Cure for this
  unaccountable Distemper; or if not, that you will be pleased to
  publish this Letter: For my Husband having a great Veneration for your
  Writings, will by that means know you do not approve of his Conduct. I
  am,<br>
<br>
  Your most humble Servant, &amp;c.</blockquote><br>

It is the Work of a Philosopher to be every Day subduing his Passions,
and laying aside his Prejudices. I endeavour at least to look upon Men
and their Actions only as an impartial Spectator, without any regard to
them as they happen to advance or cross my own private Interest. But
while I am thus employed my self, I cannot help observing, how those
about me suffer themselves to be blinded by Prejudice and Inclination,
how readily they pronounce on every Man's Character, which they can give
in two Words, and make him either good for nothing, or qualified for
every thing. On the contrary, those who search thoroughly into humane
Nature, will find it much more difficult to determine the Value of their
Fellow-Creatures, and that Mens Characters are not thus to be given in
general Words. There is indeed no such thing as a Person entirely good
or bad; Virtue and Vice are blended and mixed together, in a greater or
less Proportion, in every one; and if you would search for some
particular good Quality in its most eminent Degree of Perfection, you
will often find it in a Mind, where it is darkned and eclipsed by an
hundred other irregular Passions.<br>
<br>
Men have either no Character at all, says a celebrated Author, or it is
that of being inconsistent with themselves. They find it easier to join
Extremities, than to be uniform and of a Piece. This is finely
illustrated in <i>Xenophon's</i> Life of <i>Cyrus</i> the Great. That Author tells
us, that <i>Cyrus</i> having taken a most beautiful Lady named <i>Panthea</i>, the
Wife of <i>Abradatas</i>, committed her to the Custody of <i>Araspas</i>, a young
<i>Persian</i> Nobleman, who had a little before maintain'd in Discourse,
that a Mind truly virtuous was incapable of entertaining an unlawful
Passion. The young Gentleman had not long been in Possession of his fair
Captive, when a Complaint was made to <i>Cyrus</i>, that he not only
sollicited the Lady <i>Panthea</i> to receive him in the Room of her absent
Husband, but that finding his Entreaties had no Effect, he was preparing
to make use of Force. <i>Cyrus</i>, who loved the young Man, immediately sent
for him, and in a gentle Manner representing to him his Fault, and
putting him in Mind of his former Assertion, the unhappy Youth,
confounded with a quick Sense of his Guilt and Shame, burst out into a
Flood of Tears, and spoke as follows.<br>
<br>
<i>Oh</i> Cyrus,<i> I am convinced that I hare two Souls. Love has taught me
this Piece of Philosophy. If I had but one Soul, it could not at the
same time pant after Virtue and Vice, wish and abhor the same thing. It
is certain therefore we have two Souls: When the good Soul rules, I
undertake noble and virtuous Actions; but when the bad Soul
predominates, I am forced to do Evil. All I can say at present is, that
I find my good Soul, encouraged by your Presence, has got the Better of
my bad.</i><br>
<br>
I know not whether my Readers will allow of this Piece of Philosophy;
but if they will not, they must confess we meet with as different
Passions in one and the same Soul, as can be supposed in two. We can
hardly read the Life of a great Man who lived in former Ages, or
converse with any who is eminent among our Contemporaries, that is not
an Instance of what I am saying.<br>
<br>
But as I have hitherto only argued against the Partiality and Injustice
of giving our Judgment upon Men in gross, who are such a Composition of
Virtues and Vices, of Good and Evil; I might carry this Reflection still
farther, and make it extend to most of their Actions. If on the one
Hand, we fairly weighed every Circumstance, we should frequently find
them obliged to do that Action we at first sight condemn, in order to
avoid another we should have been much more displeased with. If on the
other Hand we nicely examined such Actions as appear most dazzling to
the Eye, we should find most of them either deficient and lame in
several Parts, produced by a bad Ambition, or directed to an ill End.
The very same Action may sometimes be so oddly circumstanced, that it is
difficult to determine whether it ought to be rewarded or punish'd.
Those who compiled the Laws of <i>England</i> were so sensible of this, that
they have laid it down as one of their first Maxims, <i>It is better
suffering a Mischief than an Inconvenience</i>; which is as much as to say
in other Words, That since no Law can take in or provide for all Cases,
it is better private Men should have some Injustice done them, than that
a public Grievance should not be redressed. This is usually pleaded in
Defence of all those Hardships which fall on particular Persons in
particular Occasions, which could not be foreseen when a Law was made.
To remedy this however as much as possible, the Court of Chancery was
erected, which frequently mitigates and breaks the Teeth of the Common
Law, in Cases of Men's Properties, while in Criminal Cases there is a
Power of pardoning still lodged in the Crown.<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding this, it is perhaps impossible in a large Government to
distribute Rewards and Punishments strictly proportioned to the Merits
of every Action. The <i>Spartan</i> Commonwealth was indeed wonderfully exact
in this Particular; and I do not remember in all my Reading to have met
with so nice an Example of Justice as that recorded by <i>Plutarch</i>, with
which I shall close my Paper for this Day.<br>
<br>
The City of <i>Sparta</i> being unexpectedly attacked by a powerful Army of
<i>Thebans</i>, was in very great Danger of falling into the Hands of their
Enemies. The Citizens suddenly gathering themselves into a Body, fought
with a Resolution equal to the Necessity of their Affairs, yet no one so
remarkably distinguished himself on this Occasion, to the Amazement of
both Armies, as <i>Isadas</i> the Son of <i>Ph&oelig;bidas</i>, who was at that time in
the Bloom of his Youth, and very remarkable for the Comeliness of his
Person. He was coming out of the Bath when the Alarm was given, so that
he had not time to put on his Cloaths, much less his Armour; however
transported with a De<b>Sir</b> e to serve his Country in so great an Exigency,
snatching up a Spear in one Hand, and a Sword in the other, he flung
himself into the thickest Ranks of his Enemies. Nothing could withstand
his Fury: in what Part soever he fought he put the Enemies to Flight
without receiving a single Wound. Whether, says <i>Plutarch</i>, he was the
particular Care of some God, who rewarded his Valour that Day with an
extraordinary Protection, or, that his Enemies, struck with the
Unusualness of his Dress, and Beauty of his Shape, supposed him
something more than Man, I shall not determine.<br>
<br>
The Gallantry of this Action was judged so great by the <i>Spartans</i>, that
the <i>Ephori</i>, or chief Magistrates, decreed he should be presented with
a Garland; but as soon as they had done so, fined him a thousand
Drachmas for going out to the Battle unarmed.<br>

<blockquote><i>&mdash;Deum namque ire per omnes<br>
  Terrasque, tractusque maris, c&oelig;lumque profundum.</i><br>
<br>
Virg.<a href="transindex.html#565t"><img src="images/qmark.png" width="15" height="15" align="right" alt="translation"></a></blockquote><br>
<br>

I was Yesterday about Sun-set walking in the open Fields, 'till the
Night insensibly fell upon me. I at first amused my self with all the
Richness and Variety of Colours, which appeared in the Western Parts of
Heaven: In Proportion as they faded away and went out, several Stars and
Planets appeared one after another 'till the whole Firmament was in a
Glow. The Blewness of the <i>&AElig;ther</i> was exceedingly heightened and
enlivened by the Season of the Year, and by the Rays of all those
Luminaries that passed through it. The <i>Galaxy</i> appeared in its most
beautiful White. To compleat the Scene, the full Moon rose at length in
that clouded Majesty, which <i>Milton</i> takes Notice of, and opened to the
Eye a new Picture of Nature, which was more finely shaded, and disposed
among softer Lights than that which the Sun had before discovered to us.<br>
<br>
As I was surveying the Moon walking in her Brightness and taking her
Progress among the Constellations, a Thought rose in me which I believe
very often perplexes and disturbs Men of serious and contemplative
Natures. <i>David</i> himself fell into it in that Reflection,

<blockquote><i>When I consider the Heavens the Work of thy Fingers, the Moon and the
  Stars which thou hast ordained; what is man that thou art mindful of
  him, and the son of man that thou regardest him!</i></blockquote>

In the same manner when I considered that infinite Host of Stars, or, to
speak more Philosophically, of Suns, which were then shining upon me,
with those innumerable Sets of Planets or Worlds, which were moving
round their respective Suns; When I still enlarged the Idea, and
supposed another Heaven of Suns and Worlds rising still above this which
we discovered, and these still enlightened by a superior Firmament of
Luminaries, which are planted at so great a Distance, that they may
appear to the Inhabitants of the former as the Stars do to us; In short,
whilst I pursued this Thought, I could not but reflect on that little
insignificant Figure which I my self bore amidst the Immensity of God's
Works.<br>
<br>
Were the Sun, which enlightens this Part of the Creation, with all the
Host of Planetary Worlds, that move about him, utterly extinguished and
annihilated, they would not be missed more than a grain of Sand upon the
Sea-shore. The Space they possess is so exceedingly little, in
Comparison of the whole, that it would scarce make a <i>Blank</i> in the
Creation. The Chasm would be imperceptible to an Eye, that could take in
the whole Compass of Nature, and pass from one end of the Creation to
the other, as it is possible there may be such a Sense in our selves
hereafter, or in Creatures which are at present more exalted than our
selves. We see many Stars by the help of Glasses, which we do not
discover with our naked Eyes; and the finer our Telescopes are, the more
still are our Discoveries. <i>Huygenius</i> carries this Thought so far, that
he does not think it impossible there may be Stars whose Light is not
yet travelled down to us, since their first Creation. There is no
Question but the Universe has certain Bounds set to it; but when we
consider that it is the Work of infinite Power, prompted by infinite
Goodness, with an infinite Space to exert it self in, how can our
Imagination set any Bounds to it?<br>
<br>
To return therefore to my first Thought, I could not but look upon
myself with secret Horrour, as a Being that was not worth the smallest
Regard of one who had so great a Work under his Care and
Superintendency. I was afraid of being overlooked amidst the Immensity
of Nature, and lost among that infinite Variety of Creatures, which in
all Probability swarm through all these immeasurable Regions of Matter.<br>
<br>
In order to recover my self from this mortifying Thought, I considered
that it took its Rise from those narrow Conceptions, which we are apt to
entertain of the Divine Nature. We our selves cannot attend to many
different Objects at the same Time. If we are careful to inspect some
Things, we must of Course neglect others. This Imperfection which we
observe in our selves, is an Imperfection that cleaves in some Degree to
Creatures of the highest Capacities, as they are Creatures, that is,
Beings of finite and limited Natures. The Presence of every created
Being is confined to a certain Measure of Space, and consequently his
Observation is stinted to a certain number of Objects. The Sphere in
which we move, and act, and understand, is of a wider Circumference to
one Creature than another, according as we rise one above another in the
Scale of Existence. But the widest of these our Spheres has its
Circumference. When therefore we reflect on the Divine Nature, we are so
used and accustomed to this Imperfection in our selves, that we cannot
forbear in some measure ascribing it to him in whom there is no shadow
of Imperfection. Our Reason indeed assures us that his Attributes are
Infinite, but the Poorness of our Conceptions is such, that it cannot
forbear setting Bounds to every Thing it contemplates, till our Reason
comes again to our Succour, and throws down all those little Prejudices
which rise in us unawares, and are natural to the Mind of Man.<br>
<br>
We shall therefore utterly extinguish this melancholy Thought, of our
being overlooked by our Maker in the Multiplicity of his Works, and the
Infinity of those Objects among which he seems to be incessantly
employed, if we consider, in the first Place, that he is Omnipresent;
and, in the second, that he is Omniscient.<br>
<br>
If we consider him in his Omnipresence: His Being passes through,
actuates, and supports the whole Frame of Nature. His Creation, and
every Part of it, is full of him. There is nothing he has made, that is
either so distant, so little, or so inconsiderable, which he does not
essentially inhabit. His Substance is within the Substance of every
Being, whether material, or immaterial, and as intimately present to it
as that Being is to it self. It would be an Imperfection in him, were he
able to remove out of one Place into another, or to withdraw himself
from any Thing he has created, or from any Part of that Space which is
diffused and spread abroad to Infinity. In short, to speak of him in the
Language of the old Philosopher, he is a Being whose Centre is every
where, and his Circumference no where.<br>
<br>
In the second Place, he is Omniscient as well as Omnipresent. His
Omniscience indeed necessarily and naturally flows from his
Omnipresence; he cannot but be conscious of every Motion that arises in
the whole material World, which he thus essentially pervades, and of
every Thought that is stirring in the intellectual World, to every Part
of which he is thus intimately united. Several Moralists have considered
the Creation as the Temple of God, which he has built with his own
Hands, and which is filled with his Presence. Others have considered
infinite Space as the Receptacle, or rather the Habitation of the
Almighty: But the noblest and most exalted Way of considering this
infinite Space is that of <b>Sir</b>  <i>Isaac Newton</i>, who calls it the
<i>Sensorium</i> of the Godhead. Brutes and Men have their <i>Sensoriola</i>, or
little <i>Sensoriums</i>, by which they apprehend the Presence and perceive
the Actions of a few Objects, that lie contiguous to them. Their
Knowledge and Observation turns within a very narrow Circle. But as God
Almighty cannot but perceive and know every Thing in which he resides,
Infinite Space gives Room to Infinite Knowledge, and is, as it were, an
Organ to Omniscience.<br>
<br>
Were the Soul separate from the Body, and with one Glance of Thought
should start beyond the Bounds of the Creation, should it for Millions
of Years continue its Progress through Infinite Space with the same
Activity, it would still find it self within the Embrace of its Creator,
and encompassed round with the Immensity of the Godhead. Whilst we are
in the Body he is not less present with us, because he is concealed from
us.

<blockquote><i>O that I knew where I might find him!</i> says Job. <i>Behold I go
  forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him.
  On the left hand, where he does work, but I cannot behold him: he
  hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him.</i></blockquote>

In short, Reason as well as Revelation assures us, that he cannot be
absent from us, notwithstanding he is undiscovered by us.<br>
<br>
In this Consideration of God Almighty's Omnipresence and Omniscience
every uncomfortable Thought vanishes. He cannot but regard every Thing
that has Being, especially such of his Creatures who fear they are not
regarded by him. He is privy to all their Thoughts, and to that Anxiety
of Heart in particular, which is apt to trouble them on this Occasion:
For, as it is impossible he should overlook any of his Creatures, so we
may be confident that he regards, with an Eye of Mercy, those who
endeavour to recommend themselves to his Notice, and in an unfeigned
Humility of Heart think themselves unworthy that he should be mindful of
them.<br>

<br>

As my Correspondents begin to grow pretty numerous, I think my self
obliged to take some Notice of them, and shall therefore make this Paper
a Miscellany of Letters. I have, since my reassuming the Office of
SPECTATOR, received abundance of Epistles from Gentlemen of the Blade,
who, I find, have been so used to Action that they know not how to lie
still: They seem generally to be of Opinion, that the Fair at home ought
to reward them for their Services abroad, and that, till the Cause of
their Country calls them again into the Field, they have a sort of Right
to Quarter themselves upon the Ladies. In Order to favour their
Approaches, I am de<b>Sir</b> ed by some to enlarge upon the Accomplishments of
their Profession, and by others to give them my Advice in the carrying
on of their Attacks. But let us hear what the Gentlemen say for
themselves.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  Mr. SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'Tho' it may look somewhat perverse amidst the Arts of Peace, to talk
  too much of War, it is but Gratitude to pay the last Office to its
  <i>Manes</i>, since even Peace it self is, in some Measure, obliged to it
  for its Being.<br>
<br>
  'You have, in your former Papers, always recommended the Accomplished
  to the Favour of the Fair; and, I hope, you will allow me to represent
  some Part of a Military Life not altogether unnecessary to the forming
  a Gentleman. I need not tell you that in <i>France</i>, whose Fashions we
  have been formerly so fond of, almost every one derives his Pretences
  to Merit from the Sword; and that a Man has scarce the Face to make
  his Court to a Lady, without some Credentials from the Service to
  recommend him. As the Profession is very ancient, we have Reason to
  think some of the greatest Men, among the old <i>Romans</i>, derived many
  of their Virtues from it, their Commanders being frequently, in other
  Respects, some of the most shining Characters of the Age.<br>
<br>
  'The Army not only gives a Man Opportunities of exercising those two
  great Virtues <i>Patience</i> and <i>Courage</i>, but often produces them in
  Minds where they had scarce any Footing before. I must add, that it is
  one of the best Schools in the World to receive a general Notion of
  Mankind in, and a certain Freedom of Behaviour, which is not so easily
  acquired in any other Place. At the same Time I must own, that some
  Military Airs are pretty extraordinary, and that a Man who goes into
  the Army a Coxcomb will come out of it a Sort of Publick Nuisance: But
  a Man of Sense, or one who before had not been sufficiently used to a
  mixed Conversation, generally takes the true Turn. The Court has in
  all Ages been allowed to be the Standard of Good-breeding; and I
  believe there is not a juster Observation in Monsieur <i>Rochefoucault</i>,
  than that

<blockquote><i>A Man who has been bred up wholly to
Business, can never get the Air of a Courtier at Court, but
will immediately catch it in the Camp.</i></blockquote>

  The Reason of this most certainly is, that the very Essence of
  Good-Breeding and Politeness consists in several Niceties, which are
  so minute that they escape his Observation, and he falls short of the
  Original he would copy after; but when he sees the same Things charged
  and aggravated to a Fault, he no sooner endeavours to come up to the
  Pattern which is set before him, than, though he stops somewhat short
  of that, he naturally rests where in reality he ought. I was two or
  three Days ago, mightily pleased with the Observation of an humourous
  Gentleman upon one of his Friends, who was in other Respects every way
  an accomplished Person, That <i>he wanted nothing but a Dash of the
  Coxcomb in him</i>; by which he understood a little of that Alertness and
  Unconcern in the common Actions of Life, which is usually so visible
  among Gentlemen of the Army, and which a Campaign or two would
  infallibly have given him.<br>
<br>
  'You will easily guess, <b>Sir</b> , by this my Panegyrick upon a Military
  Education, that I am my self a Soldier, and indeed I am so; I
  remember, within three Years after I had been in the Army, I was
  ordered into the Country a Recruiting. I had very particular Success
  in this Part of the Service, and was over and above assured, at my
  going away, that I might have taken a young Lady, who was the most
  considerable Fortune in the County, along with me. I preferred the
  Pursuit of Fame at that time to all other Considerations, and tho' I
  was not absolutely bent on a Wooden Leg, resolved at least to get a
  Scar or two for the good of <i>Europe.</i> I have at present as much as I
  de<b>Sir</b> e of this Sort of Honour, and if you could recommend me
  effectually, should be well enough contented to pass the Remainder of
  my Days in the Arms of some dear kind Creature, and upon a pretty
  Estate in the Country: This, as I take it, would be following the
  Example of <i>Lucius Cincinnatus</i>, the old <i>Roman</i> Dictator, who at the
  End of a War left the Camp to follow the Plow. I am, <b>Sir</b> , with all
  imaginable Respect,<br>
<br>
<i>Your most Obedient,<br>
Humble Servant</i>,<br>
<br>
Will. Warly.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
  <i>Mr.</i> SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'I am an Half-pay Officer, and am at present with a Friend in the
  Country. Here is a rich Widow in the Neighbourhood, who has made Fools
  of all the Fox-hunters within fifty Miles of her. She declares she
  intends to marry, but has not yet been asked by the Man she could
  like. She usually admits her humble Admirers to an Audience or two,
  but, after she has once given them Denial will never see them more. I
  am assured by a Female Relation, that I shall have fair Play at her;
  but as my whole Success Depends on my first Approaches, I de<b>Sir</b> e your
  Advice, whether I had best <i>Storm</i> or proceed by way of <i>Sap.</i><br>
<br>
<i>  I am, <b>Sir</b> , Yours, &amp;c.</i><br>
<br>
  '<i>P. S.</i> I had forgot to tell you, that I have already carried one of
  her Outworks, that is, secured her Maid.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
  <i>Mr.</i> SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'I have assisted in several Sieges in the <i>Low-Countries</i>, and being
  still willing to employ my Talents, as a Soldier and Engineer, lay
  down this Morning at Seven a Clock before the Door of an obstinate
  Female, who had for some time refused me Admittance. I made a Lodgment
  in an outer Parlour about Twelve: The Enemy retired to her
  Bed-Chamber, yet I still pursued, and about two a-Clock this Afternoon
  she thought fit to Capitulate. Her Demands are indeed somewhat high,
  in Relation to the Settlement of her Fortune. But being in Possession
  of the House, I intend to insist upon <i>Carte-Blanche</i>, and am in
  hopes, by keeping off all other Pretenders for the Space of twenty
  four Hours, to starve her into a Compliance. I beg your speedy Advice,
  and am,<br>
<br>
  <i><b>Sir</b> , Yours</i>, Peter Push.<br>
<br>
  From my Camp in <i>Red-Lion</i> Square, <i>Saturday</i> 4, in the Afternoon.</blockquote><br>

<br>

I have received private Advice from some of my Correspondents, that if I
would give my Paper a general Run, I should take care to season it with
Scandal. I have indeed observed of late, that few Writings sell which
are not filled with great Names and illustrious Titles. The Reader
generally casts his Eye upon a new Book, and if he finds several Letters
separated from one another by a Dash, <a name="fr5671">he</a> buys it up, and peruses it with
great Satisfaction. An <i>M</i> and an <i>h</i>, a <i>T</i> and an <i>r</i><a href="#f5671"><sup>1</sup></a>, with a
short Line between them, has sold many an Insipid Pamphlet. Nay I have
known a whole Edition go off by vertue of two or three well written
&amp;c&mdash;'s.<br>
<br>
A sprinkling of <a name="fr5672">the</a> Words <i>Faction, Frenchman, Papist, Plunderer,</i> and
the like significant Terms, in an Italick Character, have also a very
good Effect upon the Eye of the <span style="color: #996633;">Purchaser</span><a href="#f5672"><sup>2</sup></a>; not to mention
<i>Scribler, Lier, Rogue, Rascal, Knave,</i> and <i>Villain</i>, without which it
is impossible to carry on a Modern Controversie.<br>
<br>
Our Party-writers are so sensible of the secret Vertue of an Innuendo to
recommend their Productions, that of late they never mention the Q&mdash;n or
P&mdash;l at length, though they speak of them with Honour, and with that
Deference which is due to them from every private Person. It gives a
secret Satisfaction to a Peruser of these mysterious Works, that he is
able to decipher them without help, and, by the Strength of his own
natural Parts, to fill up a Blank-Space, or make out a Word that has
only the first or last Letter to it.<br>
<br>
Some of our Authors indeed, when they would be more Satyrical than
ordinary, omit only the Vowels of a great Man's Name, and fall most
unmercifully upon all the Consonants. This way of Writing was first of
all introduced by <i>T&mdash;m Br&mdash;wn</i>, of facetious Memory, who, after having
gutted a proper Name of all its intermediate Vowels, used to plant it in
his Works, and make as free with it as he pleased, without any Danger of
the Statute.<br>
<br>
That I may imitate these celebrated Authors, and publish a Paper which
shall be more taking than ordinary, I have here drawn up a very curious
Libel, in which a Reader of Penetration will find a great deal of
concealed Satyr, and if he be acquainted with the present Posture of
Affairs, will easily discover the Meaning of it.<br>
<br>
'If there are <i>four</i> Persons in the Nation who endeavour to bring all
things into Confusion, and ruin their native Country, I think every
honest <i>Engl&mdash;shm&mdash;n</i> ought to be upon his Guard. That there are such,
every one will agree with me, who hears me name *** with his first
Friend and Favourite ***, not to mention *** nor ***. These People may
cry Ch&mdash;rch, Ch&mdash;rch, as long as they please, but, to make use of a homely
Proverb, The Proof of the P&mdash;dd-ng is in the eating. This I am sure of,
that if a <i>certain Prince</i> should concur with a <i>certain Prelate</i>, (and
we have Monsieur Z&mdash;n's Word for it) our Posterity would be in a sweet
P&mdash;ckle. Must the <i>British</i> Nation suffer forsooth, because my Lady
<i>Q&mdash;p&mdash;t&mdash;s</i> has been disobliged? Or is it reasonable that our <i>English</i>
Fleet, which used to be the Terror of the Ocean, should lie Windbound
for the sake of a &mdash;&mdash;. I love to speak out and declare my Mind clearly,
when I am talking for the Good of my Country. I will not make my Court
to an ill Man, tho' he were a B&mdash;y or a T&mdash;t. Nay, I would not stick to
call so wretched a Politician, a Traitor, an Enemy to his Country, and a
Bl&mdash;nd&mdash;rb&mdash;ss, &amp;c., &amp;c.<br>
<br>
The remaining Part of this Political Treatise, which is written after
the manner of the most celebrated Authors in <i>Great Britain</i>, I may
communicate to the Publick at a more convenient Season. In the mean
while I shall leave this with my curious Reader, as some ingenious
Writers do their Enigmas, and if any sagacious Person can fairly
unriddle it, I will print his Explanation, and, if he pleases, acquaint
the World with his Name.<br>
<br>
I hope this short Essay will convince my Readers, it is not for want of
Abilities that I avoid State-tracts, and that if I would apply my Mind
to it, I might in a little time be as great a Master of the Political
Scratch as any the most eminent Writer of the Age. I shall only add,
that in order to outshine all this Modern Race of <i>Syncopists</i>, and
thoroughly content my <i>English</i> Readers, I intend shortly to publish a
SPECTATOR, that shall not have a single Vowel in it.<br>

I was Yesterday in a Coffee-House not far from the <i>Royal Exchange</i>,
where I observed three Persons in close Conference over a Pipe of
Tobacco; upon which, having filled one for my own use, I lighted it at
the little Wax Candle that stood before them; and after having thrown in
two or three Whiffs amongst them, sat down and made one of the Company.
I need not tell my Reader, that lighting a Man's Pipe at the same
Candle, is looked upon among Brother-smokers as an Overture to
Conversation and Friendship. As we here lay our Heads together in a very
amicable Manner, being intrenched under a Cloud of our own raising, I
took up the last SPECTATOR, and casting my Eye over it, <br>
<br>
<i>The</i> SPECTATOR,
says I, <i>is very witty to-Day;</i> <br>
<br>
upon which a lusty lethargick old
Gentleman, who sat at the Upper-end of the Table, having gradually blown
out of his Mouth a great deal of Smoke, which he had been collecting for
some Time before, <br>
<br>
<i>Ay,</i> says he, <i>more witty than wise I am afraid.</i> <br>
<br>
His
Neighbour who sat at his right Hand immediately coloured, and being an
angry Politician, laid down his Pipe with so much Wrath that he broke it
in the Middle, and by that Means furnished me with a Tobacco-stopper. I
took it up very sedately, and looking him full in the Face, made use of
it from Time to Time all the while he was speaking: <br>
<br>
<i>This fellow,</i> says
he, <i>can't for his Life keep out of Politicks. Do you see how he abuses four great Men here?</i> <br>
<br>
I fix'd my Eye very attentively on the Paper, and
asked him if he meant those who were represented by Asterisks.<br>

<br>
<i>Asterisks,</i> says he, <i>do you call them? they are all of them Stars. He
might as well have put Garters to 'em. Then pray do but mind the two or
three next Lines? Ch&mdash;rch and P&mdash;dd-ing in the same Sentence! Our Clergy
are very much beholden to him.</i> <br>
<br>
Upon this the third Gentleman, who was
of a mild Disposition, and, as I found, a Whig in his Heart, de<b>Sir</b> ed him
not to be too severe upon the <b>Spectator</b> neither; For, says he, <br>
<br>
<i>you find
he is very cautious of giving Offence, and has therefore put two Dashes
into his Pudding. <br>
<br>
A Fig for his Dash,</i> says the angry Politician. <i>In
his next Sentence he gives a plain Innuendo, that our Posterity will be
in a sweet P&mdash;ckle. What does the Fool mean by his Pickle? Why does not
he write it at length, if he means honestly? <br>
<br>
I have read over the whole
Sentence,</i> says I; <i>but I look upon the Parenthesis in the Belly of it
to be the most dangerous Part, and as full of Insinuations as it can
hold. <br>
<br>
But who,</i> says I, <i>is my Lady Q&mdash;p&mdash;t&mdash;s? <br>
<br>
Ay, Answer that if you can,
<b>Sir</b> ,</i> says the furious Statesman to the poor Whig that sate over-against
him. But without giving him Time to reply, <i>I do assure you,</i> says he,
<i>were I my Lady</i> Q&mdash;p&mdash;t&mdash;s, <i>I would sue him for</i> Scandalum Magnatum.
<i>What is the World come to? Must every Body be allowed to&mdash;?</i> <br>
<br>
He had by
this time filled a new Pipe and applying it to his Lips, when we
expected the last Word of his Sentence, put us off with a Whiff of
Tobacco; which he redoubled with so much Rage and Trepidation, that he
almost stifled the whole Company. After a short Pause, I owned that I
thought the <b>Spectator</b> had gone too far in writing so many Letters of my
Lady <i>Q&mdash;p&mdash;t&mdash;s'</i>s Name; <i>but however</i>, says I, <i>he has made a little
Amends for it in his next Sentence, where he leaves a blank Space
without so much as a Consonant to direct us? I mean</i>, says I, <i>after
those Words</i>, The Fleet, that used to be the Terrour of the Ocean,
should be Wind-bound for the sake of a &mdash;&mdash;; <i>after which ensues a Chasm,
that in my Opinion looks modest enough. <br>
<br>
<b>Sir</b> </i>, says my Antagonist, <i>you
may easily know his Meaning by his Gaping; I suppose he designs his
Chasm, as you call it, for an Hole to creep out at, but I believe it
will hardly serve his Turn. Who can endure to see the great Officers of
State, the</i> B&mdash;y's <i>and</i> T&mdash;t's <i>treated after so scurrilous a Manner? <br>
<br>
I
can't for my Life</i>, says I, <i>imagine who they are the</i> <b>Spectator</b> <i>means?
<br>
<br>
No!</i> says he,&mdash; <i>Your humble Servant, <b>Sir</b> !</i> Upon which he flung himself
back in his Chair after a contemptuous Manner, and smiled upon the old
lethargick Gentleman on his left Hand, who I found was his great
Admirer. The Whig however had begun to conceive a Good-will towards me,
and seeing my Pipe out, very generously offered me the Use of his Box;
but I declined it with great Civility, being obliged to meet a Friend
about that Time in another Quarter of the City.<br>
<br>
At my leaving the Coffee-house, I could not forbear reflecting with my
self upon that gross Tribe of Fools who may be termed the <i>Overwise</i>,
and upon the Difficulty of writing any thing in this censorious Age,
which a weak Head may not construe into private Satyr and personal
Reflection.<br>
<br>
A Man who has a good Nose at an Innuendo, smells Treason and Sedition in
the most innocent Words that can be put together, and never sees a Vice
or Folly stigmatized, but finds out one or other of his Acquaintance
pointed at by the Writer. I remember an empty pragmatical Fellow in the
Country, who upon reading over <i>the whole Duty of Man</i>, had written the
Names of several Persons in the Village at the Side of every Sin which
is mentioned by that excellent Author; so that he had converted one of
the best Books in the World into a Libel against the 'Squire,
Church-wardens, Overseers of the Poor, and all other the most
considerable Persons in the Parish. This Book with these extraordinary
marginal Notes fell accidentally into the Hands of one who had never
seen it before; upon which there arose a current Report that Somebody
had written a Book against the 'Squire and the whole Parish. The
Minister of the Place having at that Time a Controversy with some of his
Congregation upon the Account of his Tythes, was under some Suspicion of
being the Author, 'till the good Man set his People right by shewing
them that the satyrical Passages might be applied to several others of
two or three neighbouring Villages, and that the Book was writ against
all the Sinners in England.<br>

No Vices are so incurable as those which Men are apt to glory in. One
would wonder how Drunkenness should have the good Luck to be of this
Number. <i>Anacharsis</i>, being invited to a Match of Drinking at <i>Corinth</i>,
demanded the Prize very humorously, because he was drunk before any of
the rest of the Company: for, says he, when we run a Race, he who
arrives at the Goal first is entitled to the Reward. On the contrary, in
this thirsty Generation, the Honour falls upon him who carries off the
greatest Quantity of Liquor, and knocks down the rest of the Company. I
was the other Day with honest <i>Will. Funnell</i> the <i>West Saxon</i>, who was
reckoning up how much Liquor had past through him in the last twenty
Years of his Life, which, according to his Computation, amounted to
twenty three Hogsheads of October, four Ton of Port, half a Kilderkin of
small Beer, nineteen Barrels of Cider, and three Glasses of Champaign;
besides which, he had assisted at four hundred Bowls of Punch, not to
mention Sips, Drams, and Whets without Number. I question not but every
Reader's Memory will suggest to him several ambitious young Men, who are
as vain in this Particular as <i>Will. Funnell</i>, and can boast of as
glorious Exploits.<br>
<br>
Our modern Philosophers observe, that there is a general Decay of
Moisture in the Globe of the Earth. This they chiefly ascribe to the
Growth of Vegetables, which incorporate into their own Substance many
fluid Bodies that never return again to their former Nature: But, with
Submission, they ought to throw into their Account those innumerable
rational Beings which fetch their Nourishment chiefly out of Liquids;
especially when we consider that Men, compared with their
Fellow-Creatures, drink much more than comes to their Share.<br>
<br>
But however highly this Tribe of People may think of themselves, a
drunken Man is a greater Monster than any that is to be found among all
the Creatures which God has made; as indeed there is no Character which
appears more despicable and deformed, in the Eyes of all reasonable
Persons, than that of a Drunkard. <i>Bonosus</i>, one of our own Countrymen,
who was addicted to this Vice, having set up for a Share in the Roman
Empire, and being defeated in a great Battle, hang'd himself. When he
was seen by the Army in this melancholy Situation, notwithstanding he
had behaved himself very bravely, the common Jest was, That the Thing
they saw hanging upon the Tree before them, was not a Man but a Bottle.
This Vice has very fatal Efects on the Mind, the Body, and Fortune of
the Person who is devoted to it.<br>
<br>
In regard to the Mind, it first of all discovers every Flaw in it. The
sober Man, by the Strength of Reason, may keep under and subdue every
Vice or Folly to which he is most inclined; but Wine makes every latent
Seed sprout up in the Soul, and shew it self. It gives Fury to the
Passions, and Force to those Objects which are apt to produce them.
When a young Fellow complained to an old Philosopher that his Wife was
not handsome, <i>Put less Water in your Wine, says the Philosopher, and
you'll quickly make her so</i>. Wine heightens Indifference into Love, Love
into Jealousy, and Jealousy into Madness. It often turns the
Good-natured Man into an Ideot, and the Cholerick into an Assassin. It
gives Bitterness to Resentment, it makes Vanity insupportable, and
displays every little Spot of the Soul in its utmost Deformity. Nor does
this Vice only betray the hidden Faults of a Man, and shew them in the
most odious Colours, but often occasions Faults to which he is not
naturally subject. There is more of Turn than of Truth in a Saying of
Seneca, That Drunkenness does not produce but discover Faults. Common
Experience teaches us the contrary. Wine throws a Man out of himself,
and infuses Qualities into the Mind, which she is a Stranger to in her
sober Moments. The Person you converse with, after the third Bottle, is
not the same Man who at first sat down at Table with you. Upon this
Maxim is founded one of the prettiest Sayings I ever met with, which is
ascribed to Publius Syrus, <i>Qui ebrium ludificat ladit absentem; He who
jests upon a Man that is Drunk, injures the Absent.</i><br>
<br>
Thus does Drunkenness act in direct Contradiction to Reason, whose
Business it is to clear the Mind of every Vice which is crept into it,
and to guard it against all the Approaches of any that endeavours to
make its Entrance. But besides these ill Effects which this Vice
produces in the Person who is actually under its Dominion, it has also a
bad Influence on the Mind even in its sober Moments, as it insensibly
weakens the Understanding, impairs the Memory, and makes those Faults
habitual which are produced by frequent Excesses.<br>
<br>
I should now proceed to shew the ill Effects which this Vice has on the
Bodies and Fortunes of Men; but these I shall reserve for the Subject of
some future Paper.<br>

There is scarce a Man living who is not actuated by Ambition. When this
Principle meets with an honest Mind and great Abilities, it does
infinite Service to the World; on the contrary, when a Man only thinks
of distinguishing himself, without being thus qualified for it, he
becomes a very pernicious or a very ridiculous Creature. I shall here
confine my self to that petty kind of Ambition, by which some Men grow
eminent for odd Accomplishments and trivial Performances. How many are
there whose whole Reputation depends upon a Punn or a Quibble? You may
often see an Artist in the Streets gain a Circle of Admirers, by
carrying a long Pole upon his Chin or Forehead in a perpendicular
Posture. Ambition has taught some to write with their Feet, and others
to walk upon their Hands. Some tumble into Fame, others grow immortal by
throwing themselves through a Hoop.

<blockquote><i>C&aelig;tera de genere hoc adeo sunt multa, loquacem<br>
  Delassare valent Fabium&mdash;</i></blockquote>

I am led into this Train of Thought by an Adventure I lately met with.<br>
<br>
I <a name="fr5701">was</a> the other Day at a Tavern, where the Master of the House<a href="#f5701"><sup>1</sup></a>
accommodating us himself with every thing we wanted, I accidentally fell
into a Discourse with him; and talking of a certain great Man, who shall
be nameless, he told me, That he had sometimes the Honour<i> to treat him
with a Whistle;</i> (adding by the way of Parenthesis) <i>For you must know,
Gentlemen, that I whistle the best of any Man in </i>Europe. This naturally
put me upon de<b>Sir</b> ing him to give us a Sample of his Art; upon which he
called for a Case-Knife, and applying the Edge of it to his Mouth,
converted it into a musical Instrument, and entertained me with an
<i>Italian</i> Solo. Upon laying down the Knife, he took up a Pair of clean
Tobacco Pipes; and after having slid the small End of them over the
Table in a most melodious Trill, he fetched a Tune out of them,
whistling to them at the same time in Consort. In short, the
Tobacco-Pipes became <i>Musical Pipes</i> in the Hands of our Virtuoso; who
confessed to me ingenuously, he had broke such Quantities of them, that
he had almost broke himself, before he had brought this Piece of Musick
to any tolerable Perfection. I then told him I would bring a Company of
Friends to dine with him the next Week, as an Encouragement to his
Ingenuity; upon which he thanked me, saying, That he would provide
himself with a new Frying-Pan against that Day. I replied, That it was
no matter; Roast and Boiled would serve our Turn. He smiled at my
Simplicity, and told me, That it was his Design to give us a Tune upon
it. As I was surprised at such a Promise, he sent for an old Frying-Pan,
and grating it upon the Board, whistled to it in such a melodious
Manner, that you could scarce distinguish it from a Base-Viol. He then
took his Seat with us at the Table, and hearing my Friend that was with
me humm over a Tune to himself, he told him if he would sing out he
would accompany his Voice with a Tobacco-Pipe. As my Friend has an
agreeable Base, he chose rather to sing to the Frying-Pan; and indeed
between them they made up a most extraordinary Consort. Finding our
Landlord so great a Proficient in Kitchen-Musick, I asked him if he was
Master of the Tongs and Key. He told Me that he had laid it down some
Years since, as a little unfashionable: but that if I pleased he would
give me a Lesson upon the Gridiron. He then informed me that he had
added two Bars to the Gridiron, in order to give it a greater Compass of
Sound; and I perceived was as well pleased with the Invention, as
<i>Sappho</i> could have been upon adding two Strings to the Lute. To be
short, I found that his whole Kitchen was furnished with musical
Instruments; and could not but look upon this Artist as a kind of
Burlesque Musician.<br>
<br>
He afterwards of his own Accord fell into the Imitation of several
Singing-Birds. My Friend and I toasted our Mistresses to the
Nightingale, when all of a sudden we were surpriz'd with the musick of
the Thrush. He next proceeded to the Sky-Lark, mounting up by a proper
Scale of Notes, and afterwards falling to the Ground with a very easy
and regular Descent. He then contracted his Whistle to the Voice of
several Birds of the smallest Size. As he is a Man of a larger Bulk and
higher Stature than ordinary, you would fancy him a Giant when you
look'd upon him, and a Tom Tit when you shut your Eyes. I must not omit
acquainting my Reader, that this accomplished Person was formerly the
Master of a Toy-shop near <i>Temple-Bar</i>; and that the famous <i>Charles
Mathers</i> was bred up under him. I am told that the Misfortunes which he
has met with in the World, are chiefly owing to his great Application to
his Musick; and therefore cannot but recommend him to my Readers as one
who deserves their Favour, and may afford them great Diversion over a
Bottle of Wine, which he sells at the Queen's Arms, near the End of the
little Piazza in <i>Covent-Garden.</i><br>

As the Work I have engaged in, will not only consist of Papers of Humour
and Learning, but <a name="fr5711">of</a> several Essays Moral and Divine, I shall publish
the following one, which is founded on a former SPECTATOR<a href="#f5711"><sup>1</sup></a>, and sent

Readers, as think it no Disparagement to their Understandings to give
way sometimes to a serious Thought.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <b>Sir</b> ,<br>
<br>
  In your Paper of <i>Friday</i> the 9th Instant, you had Occasion to
  consider the Ubiquity of the Godhead, and at the same time, to shew,
  that as he is present to every thing, he cannot but be attentive to
  every thing, and privy to all the Modes and Parts of its Existence;
  or, in other Words, that his Omniscience and Omnipresence are
  coexistent, and run together through the whole Infinitude of Space.
  This Consideration might furnish us with many Incentives to Devotion
  and Motives to Morality, but as this Subject has been handled by
  several excellent Writers, I shall consider it in a Light wherein I
  have not seen it placed by others.
<ul>

  <li><i>First</i>, How disconsolate is the Condition of an intellectual Being
  who is thus present with his Maker, but at the same time receives no
  extraordinary Benefit or Advantage from this his Presence!</li></ul><ul><li>

  <i>Secondly</i>, How deplorable is the Condition of an intellectual Being,
  who feels no other Effects from this his Presence but such as proceed
  from Divine Wrath and Indignation!</li></ul><ul><li>

  <i>Thirdly</i>, How happy is the Condition of that intellectual Being, who
  is sensible of his Maker's Presence from the secret Effects of his
  Mercy and Loving-kindness!</li></ul>

  <i><b>First</b>, How disconsolate is the Condition of an intellectual Being,
  who is thus present with his Maker, but at the same time receives no
  extraordinary Benefit or Advantage from this his Presence! </i><br>
<br>
Every
  Particle of Matter is actuated by this Almighty Being which passes
  through it. The Heavens and the Earth, the Stars and Planets, move and
  gravitate by Vertue of this great Principle within them. All the dead
  Parts of Nature are invigorated by the Presence of their Creator, and
  made capable of exerting their respective Qualities. The several
  Instincts, in the brute Creation, do likewise operate and work towards
  the several Ends which are agreeable to them, by this Divine Energy.
  Man only, who does not co-operate with this holy Spirit, and is
  unattentive to his Presence, receives none of those Advantages from
  it, which are perfective of his Nature, and necessary to his
  Well-being. The Divinity is with him, and in him, and everywhere about
  him, but of no Advantage to him. It is the same thing to a Man without
  Religion, as if there were no God in the World. It is indeed
  impossible for an infinite Being to remove himself from any of his
  Creatures, but tho' he cannot withdraw his Essence from us, which
  would argue an Imperfection in him, he can withdraw from us all the
  Joys and Consolations of it. His Presence may perhaps be necessary to
  support us in our Existence; but he may leave this our Existence to it
  self, with regard to its Happiness or Misery. For, in this Sense, he
  may cast us away from his Presence, and take his holy Spirit from us.
  This single Consideration one would think sufficient to make us open
  our Hearts to all those Infusions of Joy and Gladness which are so
  near at Hand, and ready to be poured in upon us; especially when we
  consider,<br>
<br>
  <i><b>Secondly</b>, The deplorable Condition of an intellectual Being who
  feels no other Effects from his Maker's Presence, but such as proceed
  from Divine Wrath and Indignation!</i><br>
<br>
  We may assure our selves, that the great Author of Nature will not
  always be as one who is indifferent to any of his Creatures. Those who
  will not feel him in his Love, will be sure at length to feel him in
  his Displeasure. And how dreadful is the Condition of that Creature,
  who is only sensible of the Being of his Creator by what he suffers
  from him! He is as essentially present in Hell as in Heaven, but the
  Inhabitants of those accursed Places behold him only in his Wrath, and
  shrink within the Flames to conceal themselves from him. It is not in
  the Power of Imagination to conceive the fearful Effects of
  Omnipotence incensed.<br>
<br>
But I shall only consider the Wretchedness of an intellectual Being,
who, in this Life, lies under the Displeasure of him, that at all Times
and in all Places is intimately united with him. He is able to disquiet
the Soul, and vex it in all its Faculties. He can hinder any of the
greatest Comforts of Life from refreshing us, and give an Edge to every
one of its slightest Calamities. Who then can bear the Thought of being
an Out-cast from his Presence, that is, from the Comforts of it, or of
feeling it only in its Terrors? How pathetick is that Expostulation of
<i>Job</i>, when, for the Tryal of his Patience, he was made to look upon
himself in this deplorable Condition!

<blockquote><i>Why hast thou set me as a Mark against thee, so that I am
become a Burthen to my self?</i></blockquote>

  But, <i><b>Thirdly</b>, how happy is the Condition of that intellectual Being,
  who is sensible of his Maker's Presence from the secret Effects of his
  Mercy and Loving-kindness.</i><br>
<br>
  The Blessed in Heaven behold him Face to Face; that is, are as
  sensible of his Presence as we are of the Presence of any Person whom
  we look upon with our Eyes. There is doubtless a Faculty in Spirits,
  by which they apprehend one another, as our Senses do material
  Objects; and there is no Question but our Souls, when they are
  disembodied, or placed in glorified Bodies, will by this Faculty, in
  whatever Part of Space they reside, be always sensible of the Divine
  Presence. We, who have this Veil of Flesh standing between us and the
  World of Spirits, must be Content to know that the Spirit of God is
  present with us, by the Effects which he produces in us. Our outward
  Senses are too gross to apprehend him; we may however taste and see
  how gracious he is, by his Influence upon our Minds, by those Virtuous
  Thoughts which he awakens in us, by those secret Comforts and
  Refreshments which he conveys into our Souls, and by those ravishing
  Joys and inward Satisfactions, which are perpetually springing up, and
  diffusing themselves among all the Thoughts of good Men. He is lodged
  in our very Essence, and is as a Soul within the Soul, to irradiate
  its Understanding, rectifie its Will, purifie its Passions, and
  enliven all the Powers of Man. How happy therefore is an intellectual
  Being, who, by Prayer and Meditation, by Virtue and good Works, opens
  this Communication between God and his own Soul! Tho' the whole
  Creation frowns upon him, and all Nature looks black about him, he has
  his Light and Support within him, that are able to cheer his Mind, and
  bear him up in the Midst of all those Horrors which encompass him. He
  knows that his Helper is at Hand, and is always nearer to him than any
  thing else can be, which is capable of annoying or terrifying him. In
  the Midst of Calumny or Contempt, he attends to that Being who
  whispers better things within his Soul, and whom he looks upon as his
  Defender, his Glory, and the Lifter up of his Head. In his deepest
  Solitude and Retirement, he knows that he is in Company with the
  greatest of Beings; and perceives within himself such real Sensations
  of his Presence, as are more delightful than any thing that can be met
  with in the Conversation of his Creatures. Even in the Hour of Death,
  he considers the Pains of his Dissolution to be nothing else but the
  breaking down of that Partition, which stands betwixt his Soul, and
  the Sight of that Being, who is always present with him, and is about
  to manifest it self to him in Fullness of Joy.<br>
<br>
If we would be thus Happy, and thus Sensible of our Maker's Presence,
from the secret Effects of his Mercy and Goodness, we must keep such a
Watch over all our Thoughts, that, in the Language of the Scripture, his
Soul may have Pleasure in us. We must take care not to grieve his Holy
Spirit, and endeavour to make the Meditations of our Hearts always
acceptable in his Sight, that he may delight thus to reside and dwell in
us. The Light <a name="fr5712">of</a> Nature could direct <i>Seneca</i> to this Doctrine, in a
very remarkable Passage among his Epistles:

<blockquote><i>Sacer inest in
nobis spiritus bonorum malorumque custos, et Observator, et
quemadmodum nos illum tractamus, ita et ille nos.</i><a href="#f5712"><sup>2</sup></a></blockquote>

  There is a Holy Spirit residing in us, who watches and observes both
  Good and Evil Men, and will treat us after the same Manner that we
  treat him. But I <a name="fr5713">shall</a> conclude this Discourse with those more
  emphatical Words in Divine Revelation,

<blockquote><i>If a Man
love me, he will keep my Word, and my Father will love him,
and we will come unto him, and make our Abode with him.</i><a href="#f5713"><sup>3</sup></a></blockquote>

I am the more pleased with these my Papers, since I find they have
encouraged several Men of Learning and Wit to become my Correspondents:
I Yesterday received the following Essay against Quacks, which I shall
here communicate to my Readers for the Good of the Publick, begging the
Writer's Pardon for those Additions and Retrenchments which I have made
in it.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
The De<b>Sir</b> e of Life is so natural and strong a Passion, that I have long
since ceased to wonder at the great Encouragement which the Practice of
Physick finds among us. Well-constituted Governments have always made
the Profession of a Physician both honourable and advantageous. <i>Homer's
Machaon</i> and <i>Virgil's Japis</i> were Men of Renown, Heroes in War, and
made at least as much Havock among their Enemies as among their Friends.
Those who have little or no Faith in the Abilities of a Quack will apply
themselves to him, either because he is willing to sell Health at a
reasonable Profit, or because the Patient, like a drowning Man, catches
at every Twig, and hopes for Relief from the most Ignorant, when the
most able Physicians give him none. Though Impudence and many Words are
as necessary to these Itinerary <i>Galens</i> as a laced Hat or a Merry
<i>Andrew</i>, yet they would turn very littl to the Advantage of the Owner,
if there were not some inward Disposition in the sick Man to favour the
Pretensions of the Mountebank. Love of Life in the one, and of Mony in
the other, creates a good Correspondence between them.<br>
<br>
There is scarce a City in <i>Great-Britain</i> but has one of this Tribe, who
takes it into his Protection, and on the Market-Day harangues the good
People of the Place with Aphorisms and Receipts. You may depend upon it,
he comes not there for his own private Interest, but out of a particular
Affection to the Town. I remember one of those Public-spirited Artists
at <i>Hammersmith</i>, who told his Audience 'that he had been born and bred
there, and that having a special Regard for the Place of his Nativity,
he was determined to make a Present of five Shillings to as many as
would accept of it.' The whole Crowd stood agape, and ready to take the
Doctor at his Word; when putting his Hand into a long Bag, as every one
was expecting his Crown-Piece, he drew out an handful of little Packets,
each of which he informed the <b>Spectators</b> was constantly sold at five
Shillings and six pence, but that he would bate the odd five Shillings
to every Inhabitant of that Place: The whole Assembly immediately closed
with this generous Offer, and took off all his Physick, after the Doctor
had made them vouch for one another, that there were no Foreigners among
them, but that they were all <i>Hammersmith</i>-Men.<br>
<br>
There is another Branch of Pretenders to this Art, who, without either
Horse or Pickle-Herring, lie snug in a Garret, and send down Notice to
the World of their extraordinary Parts and Abilities by printed Bills
and Advertisements. These seem to have derived their Custom from an
<i>Eastern</i> Nation which <i>Herodotus</i> speaks of, among whom it was a Law,
that whenever any Cure was performed, both the Method of the Cure, and
an Account of the Distemper, should be fixed in some Publick Place; but
as Customs will corrupt, these our Moderns provide themselves of Persons
to attest the Cure, before they publish or make an Experiment of the
Prescription. I have heard of a Porter, who serves as a Knight of the
Post under one of these Operators, and tho' he was never sick in his
Life, has been cured of all the Diseases in the Dispensary. These are
the Men whose Sagacity has invented Elixirs of all sorts, Pills and
Lozenges, and take it as an Affront if you come to them before you are
given over by every Body else. Their Medicines <i>are infallible, and
never fail of Success</i>, that is of enriching the Doctor, and setting the
Patient effectually at Rest.<br>
<br>
I lately dropt into a Coffee-house at <i>Westminster</i>, where I found the
Room hung round with Ornaments of this Nature. There were Elixirs,
Tinctures, the <i>Anodine Fotus, English</i> Pills, Electuaries, and, in
short, more Remedies than I believe there are Diseases. At the Sight of
so many Inventions, I could not but imagine my self in a kind of Arsenal
or Magazine, where store of Arms were reposited against any sudden
Invasion. Should you be attack'd by the Enemy Side-ways, here was an
infallible Piece of defensive Armour to cure the Pleurisie: Should a
Distemper beat up your Head Quarters, here you might purchase an
impenetrable Helmet, or, in the Language of the Artist, a Cephalic
Tincture: If your main Body be assaulted, here are various Kinds of
Armour in Case of various Onsets. I began to congratulate the present
Age upon the Happiness Men might reasonably hope for in Life, when Death
was thus in a manner Defeated; and when Pain it self would be of so
short a Duration, that it would but just serve to enhance the Value of
Pleasure: While I was in these Thoughts, I unluckily called to mind a
Story of an Ingenious Gentleman of the last Age, who lying violently
afflicted with the Gout, a Person came and offered his Service to Cure
him by a Method, which he assured him was Infallible; the Servant who
received the Message carried it up to his Master, who enquiring whether
the Person came on Foot or in a Chariot; and being informed that he was
on Foot: 

<blockquote><i>Go, says he, send the Knave about his Business: Was his Method
as infallible as he pretends, he would long before now have been in his
Coach and Six.</i> </blockquote>

In like manner I concluded, that had all these
Advertisers arrived to that Skill they pretend to, they would have had
no Need for so many Years successively to publish to the World the Place
of their Abode, and the Virtues of their Medicines. One of these
Gentlemen indeed pretends to an effectual Cure for Leanness: What
Effects it may have had upon those who have try'd it I cannot tell; but
I am credibly informed, that the Call for it has been so great, that it
has effectually cured the Doctor himself of that Distemper. Could each
of them produce so good an Instance of the Success of his Medicines,
they might soon persuade the World into an Opinion of them.<br>
<br>
I observe that most of the Bills agree in one Expression, <i>viz.</i> that
(<i>with God's Blessing</i>) they perform such and such Cures: This
Expression is certainly very proper and emphatical, for that is all they
have for it. And if ever a Cure is performed on a Patient where they are
concerned, they can claim no greater Share in it than <i>Virgil's Japis</i>
in the curing of <i>&AElig;neas</i>; he tried his Skill, was very assiduous about
the Wound, and indeed was the only visible Means that relieved the Hero;
but the Poet assures us it was the particular Assistance of a Deity that
speeded the Operation. An <i>English</i> Reader may see the whole Story in
Mr. <i>Dryden's</i> Translation.

My Paper on the Club of Widows has brought me in several Letters; and,
among the rest, a long one from Mrs. President, as follows.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <i>Smart <b>Sir</b> ,</i><br>
<br>
  'You are pleased to be very merry, as you imagine, with us Widows: And
  you seem to ground your Satyr on our receiving Consolation so soon
  after the Death of our Dears, and the Number we are pleased to admit
  for our Companions; but you never reflect what Husbands we have
  buried, and how short a Sorrow the Loss of them was capable of
  occasioning. For my own Part, Mrs. President as you call me, my First
  Husband I was marry'd to at Fourteen, by my Uncle and Guardian (as I
  afterwards discovered) by way of Sale, for the Third part of my
  Fortune. This Fellow looked upon me as a meer Child, he might breed up
  after his own Fancy; if he kissed my Chamber-Maid before my Face, I
  was supposed so ignorant, how could I think there was any Hurt in it?
  When he came home Roaring Drunk at five in the Morning, 'twas the
  Custom of all Men that live in the World. I was not to see a Penny of
  Money, for, poor Thing, how could I manage it? He took a handsome
  Cousin of his into the House, (as he said) to be my Housekeeper, and
  to govern my Servants; for how should I know how to rule a Family? and
  while she had what Money she pleased, which was but reasonable for the
  Trouble she was at for my Good, I was not to be so censorious as to
  dislike Familiarity and Kindness between near Relations. I was too
  great a Coward to contend, but not so ignorant a Child to be thus
  imposed upon. I resented his Contempt as I ought to do, and as most
  poor passive blinded Wives do, 'till it pleased Heaven to take away my
  Tyrant, who left me free Possession of my own Land, and a large
  Jointure. My Youth and Money brought me many Lovers, and several
  endeavoured to establish an Interest in my Heart while my Husband was
  in his last Sickness; the Honourable <i>Edward Waitfort</i> was one of the
  first who addressed to me, advised to it by a Cousin of his that was
  my intimate Friend, and knew to a Penny what I was worth. Mr.
  <i>Waitfort</i> is a very agreeable Man, and every Body would like him as
  well as he does himself, if they did not plainly see that his Esteem
  and Love is all taken up, and by such an Object, as 'tis impossible to
  get the better of. I mean himself. He made no doubt of marrying me
  within Four or Five Months, and begun to proceed with such an assured
  easie Air, that piqued my Pride not to banish him; quite contrary, out
  of pure Malice, I heard his first Declaration with so much innocent
  Surprize, and blushed so prettily, I perceived it touched his very
  Heart, and he thought me the best-natured Silly poor thing on Earth.
  When a Man has such a Notion of a Woman, he loves her better than he
  thinks he does. I was overjoy'd to be thus revenged on him, for
  designing on my Fortune; and finding it was in my Power to make his
  Heart ake, I resolved to compleat my Conquest, and entertain'd several
  other Pretenders. The first Impression of my undesigning Innocence was
  so strong in his Head, he attributed all my Followers to the
  inevitable Force of my Charms, and from several Blushes and side
  Glances, concluded himself the Favourite; and when I used him like a
  Dog for my Diversion, he thought it was all Prudence and Fear, and
  pitied the Violence I did my own Inclinations to comply with my
  Friends, when I marry'd <b>Sir</b>  <i>Nicholas Fribble</i> of Sixty Years of Age.
  You know, <b>Sir</b> , the Case of Mrs. <i>Medlar</i>, I hope you would not have
  had me cry out my Eyes for such a Husband. I shed Tears enough for my
  Widowhood a Week after my Marriage, and when he was put in his Grave,
  reckoning he had been two Years dead, and my self a Widow of that
  Standing, I married three Weeks afterwards <i>John Sturdy</i>, Esq., his
  next Heir. I had indeed some Thoughts of taking Mr. <i>Waitfort</i>, but I
  found he could stay, and besides he thought it indecent to ask me to
  marry again 'till my Year was out, so privately resolving him for my
  Fourth, I took Mr. <i>Sturdy</i> for the present. Would you believe it,
  <b>Sir</b> , Mr. <i>Sturdy</i> was just Five and Twenty, about Six Foot high, and
  the stoutest Fox-hunter in the Country, and I believe I wished ten
  thousand times for my old <i>Fribble</i> again; he was following his Dogs
  all the Day, and all the Night keeping them up at Table with him and
  his Companions: however I think my self obliged to them for leading
  him a Chase in which he broke his Neck. Mr. <i>Waitfort</i> began his
  Addresses anew, and I verily believe I had married him now, but there
  was a young Officer in the Guards, that had debauched two or three of
  my Acquaintance, and I could not forbear being a little vain of his
  Courtship. Mr. <i>Waitfort</i> heard of it, and read me such an insolent
  Lecture upon the Conduct of Women, I married the Officer that very
  Day, out of pure Spight to him. Half an Hour after I was married I
  received a Penitential Letter from the Honourable Mr. <i>Edward
  Waitfort,</i> in which he begged Pardon for his Passion, as proceeding
  from the Violence of his Love: I triumphed when I read it, and could
  not help, out of the Pride of my Heart, shewing it to my new Spouse:
  and we were very merry together upon it. Alas! my Mirth lasted a short
  time; my young Husband was very much in Debt when I marry'd him, and
  his first Action afterwards was to set up a gilt Chariot and Six, in
  fine Trappings before and behind. I had married so hastily, I had not
  the Prudence to reserve my Estate in my own Hands; my ready Money was
  lost in two Nights at the Groom Porter's; and my Diamond Necklace,
  which was stole I did not know how, I met in the Street upon <i>Jenny
  Wheadle's</i> Neck. My Plate vanished Piece by Piece, and I had been
  reduced to downright Pewter, if my Officer had not been deliciously
  killed in a Duel, by a Fellow that had cheated him of Five Hundred
  Pounds, and afterwards, at his own Request, satisfy'd him and me too,
  by running him through the Body. Mr. <i>Waitfort</i> was still in Love, and
  told me so again; and to prevent all Fears of ill Usage, he de<b>Sir</b> 'd me
  to reserve every thing in my own Hands: But now my Acquaintance begun
  to wish me Joy of his Constancy, my Charms were declining, and I could
  not resist the Delight I took in shewing the young Flirts about Town,
  it was yet in my Power to give Pain to a Man of Sense: This, and some
  private Hopes he would hang himself, and what a Glory would it be for
  me, and how I should be envy'd, made me accept of being third Wife to
  my Lord <i>Friday.</i> I proposed from my Rank and his Estate, to live in
  all the Joys of Pride, but how was I mistaken? he was neither
  extravagant, nor ill-natured, nor debauched? I suffered however more
  with him than with all my others. He was splenatick. I was forced to
  sit whole Days hearkening to his imaginary Ails; it was impossible to
  tell what would please him; what he liked when the Sun shined, made
  him sick when it rained; he had no Distemper, but lived in constant
  Fear of them all: my good Genius dictated to me to bring him
  acquainted with Doctor <i>Gruel</i>; from that Day he was always contented,
  because he had Names for all his Complaints; the good Doctor furnished
  him with Reasons for all his Pains, and Prescriptions for every Fancy
  that troubled him; in hot Weather he lived upon Juleps, and let Blood
  to prevent Fevers; when it grew cloudy he generally apprehended a
  Consumption; to shorten the History of this wretched Part of my Life,
  he ruined a good Constitution by endeavouring to mend it, and took
  several Medicines, which ended in taking the grand Remedy, which cured
  both him and me of all our Uneasinesses. After his Death, I did not
  expect to hear any more of Mr. <i>Waitfort</i>, I knew he had renounced me
  to all his Friends, and been very witty upon my Choice, which he
  affected to talk of with great Indifferency; I gave over thinking of
  him, being told that he was engaged with a pretty Woman and a great
  Fortune; it vexed me a little, but not enough to make me neglect the
  Advice of my Cousin <i>Wishwell</i>, that came to see me the Day my Lord
  went into the Country with <i>Russel</i>; she told me experimentally,
  nothing put an unfaithful Lover and a dear Husband so soon out of ones
  Head, as a new one; and, at the same time, propos'd to me a Kinsman of
  hers; You understand enough of the World (said she) to know Money is
  the most valuable Consideration; he is very rich, and I am sure cannot
  live long; he has a Cough that must carry him off soon. I knew
  afterwards she had given the self-same Character of me to him; but
  however I was so much persuaded by her, I hastned on the Match, for
  fear he should die before the time came; he had the same Fears, and
  was so pressing, I married him in a Fortnight, resolving to keep it
  private a Fortnight longer. During this Fortnight Mr. <i>Waitfort</i> came
  to make me a Visit; he told me he had waited on me sooner, but had
  that Respect for me, he would not interrupt me in the first Day of my
  Affliction for my dead Lord; that as soon as he heard I was at Liberty
  to make another Choice, he had broke off a Match very advantageous for
  his Fortune, just upon the Point of Conclusion, and was forty times
  more in Love with me than ever. I never received more Pleasure in my
  Life than from this Declaration, but I composed my Face to a grave
  Air, and said the News of his Engagement had touched me to the Heart,
  that in a rash jealous Fit, I had married a Man I could never have
  thought on if I had not lost all hopes of him. Good-natured Mr.
  <i>Waitfort</i> had like to have dropped down dead at hearing this, but
  went from me with such an Air as plainly shewed me he laid all the
  Blame upon himself, and hated those Friends that had advised him to
  the Fatal Application; he seemed as much touched by my Misfortune as
  his own, for he had not the least Doubt I was still passionately in
  Love with him. The Truth of the Story is, my new Husband gave me
  Reason to repent I had not staid for him; he had married me for my
  Money, and I soon found he loved Money to Distraction; there was
  nothing he would not do to get it, nothing he would not suffer to
  preserve it; the smallest Expence keep him awake whole Nights, and
  when he paid a Bill, 'twas with as many Sighs, and after as many
  Delays, as a Man that endures the Loss of a Limb. I heard nothing but
  Reproofs for Extravagancy whatever I did. I saw very well that he
  would have starved me, but for losing my Jointures; and he suffered
  Agonies between the Grief of seeing me have so good a Stomach, and the
  Fear that if he made me fast, it might prejudice my Health. I did not
  doubt he would have broke my Heart, if I did not break his, which was
  allowed by the Law of Self-defence. The Way was very easy. I resolved
  to spend as much Money as I could, and before he was aware of the
  Stroke, appeared before him in a two thousand Pound Diamond Necklace;
  he said nothing, but went quietly to his Chamber, and, as it is
  thought, composed himself with a Dose of Opium. I behaved my self so
  well upon the Occasion, that to this Day I believe he died of an
  Apoplexy. Mr. <i>Waitfort</i> was resolved not to be too late this time,
  and I heard from him in two Days. I am almost out of my Weed at this
  present Writing, and am very doubtful whether I'll marry him or no. I
  do not think of a Seventh, for the ridiculous Reason you mention, but
  out of pure Morality that I think so much Constancy should be
  rewarded, tho' I may not do it after all perhaps. I do not believe all
  the unreasonable Malice of Mankind can give a Pretence why I should
  have been constant to the Memory of any of the Deceased, or have spent
  much time in grieving for so insolent, insignificant, negligent,
  extravagant, splenatick, or covetous Husband; my first insulted me, my
  second was nothing to me, my third disgusted me, the fourth would have
  ruined me, the fifth tormented me, and the sixth would have starved
  me. If the other Ladies you name would thus give in their Husbands
  Pictures at length, you would see they have had as little Reason as my
  self to lose their Hours in weeping and wailing.</blockquote><br>

I was once engaged in Discourse with a <i>Rosicrusian</i> about <i>the great
Secret</i>. As this kind of Men (I mean those of them who are not professed
Cheats) are over-run with Enthusiasm and Philosophy, it was very amusing
to hear this religious Adept descanting on his pretended Discovery. He
talked of the Secret as of a Spirit which lived within an Emerald, and
converted every thing that was near it to the highest Perfection it is
capable of. It gives a Lustre, says he, to the Sun, and Water to the
Diamond. It irradiates every Metal, and enriches Lead with all the
Properties of Gold. It heightens Smoak into Flame, Flame into Light, and
Light into Glory. He further added, that a single Ray of it dissipates
Pain, and Care, and Melancholy from the Person on whom it falls. In
short, says he, its Presence naturally changes every Place into a kind
of Heaven. After he had gone on for some Time in this unintelligible
Cant, I found that he jumbled natural and moral Ideas together into the
same Discourse, and that his great Secret was nothing else but
<i>Content.</i><br>
<br>
This Virtue does indeed produce, in some measure, all those Effects
which the Alchymist usually ascribes to what he calls the Philosopher's
Stone; and if it does not bring Riches, it does the same thing, by
banishing the De<b>Sir</b> e of them. If it cannot remove the Disquietudes
arising out of a Man's Mind, Body, or Fortune, it makes him easie under
them. It has indeed a kindly Influence on the Soul of Man, in respect of
every Being to whom he stands related. It extinguishes all Murmur,
Repining, and Ingratitude towards that Being who has allotted him his
Part to act in this World. It destroys all inordinate Ambition, and
every Tendency to Corruption, with regard to the Community wherein he is
placed. It gives Sweetness to his Conversation, and a perpetual Serenity
to all his Thoughts.<br>
<br>
Among the many Methods which might be made use of for the acquiring of
this Virtue, I shall only mention the two following. First of all, A Man
should always consider how much he has more than he wants; and Secondly,
How much more unhappy he might be than he really is.<br>
<br>
First of all, A Man should always consider how much he has more than he
wants. I am wonderfully pleased with the Reply which <i>Aristippus</i> made
to one who condoled him upon the Loss of a Farm, <i>Why</i>, said he, <i>I have
three Farms still, and you have but one; so that I ought rather to be
afflicted for you, than you for me.</i> On the contrary, foolish Men are
more apt to consider what they have lost than what they possess; and to
fix their Eyes upon those who are richer than themselves, rather than on
those who are under greater Difficulties. All the real Pleasures and
Conveniences of Life lie in a narrow Compass; but it is the Humour of
Mankind to be always looking forward, and straining after one who has
got the Start of them in Wealth and Honour. For this Reason, as there
are none can be properly called rich, who have not more than they want;
there are few rich Men in any of the politer Nations but among the
middle Sort of People, who keep their Wishes within their Fortunes, and
have more Wealth than they know how to enjoy. Persons of a higher Rank
live in a kind of splendid Poverty, and are perpetually wanting, because
instead of acquiescing in the solid Pleasures of Life, they endeavour to
outvy one another in Shadows and Appearances. Men of Sense have at all
times beheld with a great deal of Mirth this silly Game that is playing
over their Heads, and by contracting their De<b>Sir</b> es, enjoy all that
secret Satisfaction which others are always in quest of. The Truth is,
this ridiculous Chace after imaginary Pleasures cannot be sufficiently
exposed, as it is the great Source of those Evils which generally undo a
Nation. Let a Man's Estate be what it will, he is a poor Man if he does
not live within it, and naturally sets himself to Sale to any one that
can give him his Price. When <i>Pittacus</i>, after the Death of his Brother,
who had left him a good Estate, was offered a great Sum of Money by the
King of <i>Lydia</i>, he thanked him for his Kindness, but told him he had
already more by Half than he knew what to do with. In short, Content is
equivalent to Wealth, and Luxury to Poverty; or, to give the Thought a
more agreeable Turn, <i>Content is natural Wealth</i>, says <i>Socrates</i>; to
which I shall add, <i>Luxury is artificial Poverty.</i> I shall therefore
recommend to the Consideration of those who are always aiming after
superfluous and imaginary Enjoyments, and will not be at the Trouble of
contracting their De<b>Sir</b> es, an excellent Saying of <i>Bion</i> the
Philosopher; namely, <i>That no Man has so much Care, as he who endeavours
after the most Happiness.</i><br>
<br>
In the second Place, every one ought to reflect how much more unhappy he
might be than he really is. The former Consideration took in all those
who are sufficiently provided with the Means to make themselves easie;
this regards such as actually lie under some Pressure or Misfortune.
These may receive great Alleviation from such a Comparison as the
unhappy Person may make between himself and others, or between the
Misfortune which he suffers, and greater Misfortunes which might have
befallen him.<br>
<br>
I like the Story of the honest <i>Dutchman</i>, who, upon breaking his <i>Leg</i>
by a Fall from the Mainmast, told the Standers-by, It was a great Mercy
that 'twas not his <i>Neck.</i> To which, since I am got into Quotations,
give me leave to add the Saying of an old Philosopher, who, after having
invited some of his Friends to dine with him, was ruffled by his Wife
that came into the Room in a Passion, and threw down the Table that
stood before them; <i>Every one,</i> says he, <i>has his Calamity, and he is a
happy Man that has no greater than this</i>. We find an Instance to the
same Purpose in the Life of Doctor <i>Hammond</i>, written by Bishop <i>Fell.</i>
As this good Man was troubled with a Complication of Distempers, when he
had the Gout upon him, he used to thank God that it was not the Stone;
and when he had the Stone, that he had not both these Distempers on him
at the same time.<br>
<br>
I cannot conclude this Essay without observing that there was never any
System besides that of Christianity, which could effectually produce in
the Mind of Man the Virtue I have been hitherto speaking of. In order to
make us content with our present Condition, many of the ancient
Philosophers tell us that our Discontent only hurts our selves, without
being able to make any Alteration in our Circumstances; others, that
whatever Evil befalls us is derived to us by a fatal Necessity, to which
the Gods themselves are subject; whilst others very gravely tell the Man
who is miserable, that it is necessary he should be so to keep up the
Harmony of the Universe, and that the <i>Scheme</i> of Providence would be
troubled and perverted were he otherwise. These, and the like
Considerations, rather silence than satisfy a Man. They may shew him
that his Discontent is unreasonable, but are by no means sufficient to
relieve it. They rather give Despair than Consolation. In a Word, a Man
might reply to one of these Comforters, as <i>Augustus</i> did to his Friend
who advised him not to grieve for the Death of a Person whom he loved,
because his Grief could not fetch him again:<i> It is for that very
Reason,</i> said the Emperor, <i>that I grieve.</i><br>
<br>
On the contrary, Religion bears a more tender Regard to humane Nature.
It prescribes to every miserable Man the Means of bettering his
Condition; nay, it shews him, that the bearing of his Afflictions as he
ought to do will naturally end in the Removal of them: It makes him
easie here, because it can make him happy hereafter.<br>
<br>
Upon the whole, a contented Mind is the greatest Blessing a Man can
enjoy in this World; and if in the present Life his Happiness arises
from the subduing of his De<b>Sir</b> es, it will arise in the next from the
Gratification of them.<br>

Virg.<a href="transindex.html#575t"><img src="images/qmark.png" width="15" height="15" align="right" alt="translation"></a></blockquote><br>
<br>

A lewd young Fellow seeing an aged Hermit go by him barefoot, <i>Father</i>,
says he, <i>you are in a very miserable Condition if there is not another
World. True, Son,</i> said the Hermit; <i>but what is thy Condition if there
is? </i>Man is a Creature designed for two different States of Being, or
rather, for two different Lives. His first Life is short and transient;
his second permanent and lasting. The Question we are all concerned in
is this, In which of these two Lives it is our chief Interest to make
our selves happy? Or, in other Words, Whether we should endeavour to
secure to our selves the Pleasures and Gratifications of a Life which is
uncertain and precarious, and at its utmost Length of a very
inconsiderable Duration; or to secure to our selves the Pleasures of a
Life which is fixed and settled, and will never end? Every Man, upon the
first hearing of this Question, knows very well which Side of it he
ought to close with. But however right we are in Theory, it is plain
that in Practice we adhere to the wrong Side of the Question. We make
Provisions for this Life as tho' it were never to have an End, and for
the other Life as tho' it were never to have a Beginning.<br>
<br>
Should a Spirit of superior Rank who is a Stranger to human Nature,
accidentally alight upon the Earth, and take a Survey of its
Inhabitants; what would his Notions of us be? Would not he think that we
are a Species of Beings made for quite different Ends and Purposes than
what we really are? Must not he imagine that we were placed in this
World to get Riches and Honours? Would not he think that it was our Duty
to toil after Wealth, and Station, and Title? Nay, would not he believe
we were forbidden Poverty by Threats of eternal Punishment, and enjoined
to pursue our Pleasures under Pain of Damnation? He would certainly
imagine that we were influenced by a Scheme of Duties quite opposite to
those which are indeed prescribed to us. And truly, according to such an
Imagination, he must conclude that we are a Species of the most obedient
Creatures in the Universe; that we are constant to our Duty; and that we
keep a steddy Eye on the End for which we were sent hither.<br>
<br>
But how great would be his Astonishment, when he learnt that we were
Beings not designed to exist in this World above threescore and ten
Years? and that the greatest Part of this busy Species fall short even
of that Age? How would he be lost in Horrour and Admiration, when he
should know that this Sett of Creatures, who lay out all their
Endeavours for this Life, which scarce deserves the Name of Existence,
when, I say, he should know that this Sett of Creatures are to exist to
all Eternity in another Life, for which they make no Preparations?
Nothing can be a greater Disgrace to Reason, than that Men, who are
perswaded of these two different States of Being, should be perpetually
employed in providing for a Life of three-score and ten Years, and
neglecting to make Provision for that, which after many Myriads of Years
will be still new, and still beginning; especially when we consider that
our endeavours for making ourselves great, or rich, or honourable, or
whatever else we place our Happiness in, may after all prove
unsuccessful; whereas if we constantly and sincerely endeavour to make
our selves happy in the other Life, we are sure that our Endeavours will
succeed, and that we shall not be disappointed of our Hope.<br>
<br>
The following Question is started by one of the Schoolmen. Supposing the
whole Body of the Earth were a great Ball or Mass of the finest Sand,
and that a single Grain or Particle of this Sand should be annihilated
every thousand Years. Supposing then that you had it in your Choice to
be happy all the while this prodigious Mass of Sand was consuming by
this slow Method till there was not a Grain of it left, on Condition you
were to be miserable for ever after; or, supposing that you might be
happy for ever after, on Condition you would be miserable till the whole
Mass of Sand were thus annihilated at the Rate of one Sand in a thousand
Years: Which of these two Cases would you make your Choice?<br>
<br>
It must be confessed in this Case, so many Thousands of Years are to the
Imagination as a kind of eternity, tho' in reality they do not bear so
great a Proportion to that Duration which is to follow them, as a Unite
does to the greatest Number which you can put together in Figures, or as
one of those Sands to the supposed Heap. Reason therefore tells us,
without any Manner of Hesitation, which would be the better Part in this
Choice. However, as I have before intimated, our Reason might in such a
Case be so overset by the Imagination, as to dispose some Persons to
sink under the Consideration of the great Length of the first Part of
this Duration, and of the great Distance of that second Duration which
is to succeed it. The Mind, I say, might give it self up to that
Happiness which is at Hand, considering that it is so very near, and
that it would last so very long. But when the Choice we actually have
before us is this, Whether we will chuse to be happy for the space of
only three-score and ten, nay perhaps of only twenty or ten Years, I
might say of only a Day or an Hour, and miserable to all Eternity; or,
on the contrary, miserable for this short Term of Years, and happy for a
whole Eternity: What Words are sufficient to express that Folly and want
of Consideration which in such a Case makes a wrong Choice?<br>
<br>
I here put the Case even at the worst, by supposing (what seldom
happens) that a Course of Virtue makes us miserable in this Life: But if
we suppose (as it generally happens) that Virtue would make us more
happy even in this Life than a contrary Course of Vice; how can we
sufficiently admire the Stupidity or Madness of those Persons who are
capable of making so absurd a Choice?<br>
<br>
Every wise Man therefore will consider this Life only as it may conduce
to the Happiness of the other, and chearfully sacrifice the Pleasures of
a few Years to those of an Eternity.<br>

<blockquote><i>Nitor in adversum; nec me, qui coetera, vincit<br>
Impetus; et rapido contrarius euchor Orbi.</i><br>
<br>
Ovid.<a href="transindex.html#576t"><img src="images/qmark.png" width="15" height="15" align="right" alt="translation"></a></blockquote><br>
<br>

I remember a young Man of very lively Parts, and of a sprightly Turn in
Conversation, who had only one Fault, which was an inordinate De<b>Sir</b> e of
appearing fashionable. This ran him into many Amours, and consequently
into many Distempers. He never went to Bed till two a-Clock in the
Morning, because he would not be a queer Fellow; and was every now and
then knocked down by a Constable, to signalize his Vivacity. He was
initiated into Half a Dozen Clubs before he was One and twenty, and so
improved in them his natural Gayety of Temper, that you might frequently
trace him to his Lodgings by a range of broken Windows, and other the
like Monuments of Wit and Gallantry. To be short, after having fully
established his Reputation of being a very agreeable Rake, he died of
old Age at Five and twenty.<br>
<br>
There is indeed nothing which betrays a Man into so many Errors and
Inconveniences, as the De<b>Sir</b> e of not appearing singular; for which
Reason it is very necessary to form a right Idea of Singularity, that we
may know when it is laudable, and when it is vicious. In the first
Place, every Man of Sense will agree with me, that Singularity is
laudable, when, in Contradiction to a Multitude, it adheres to the
Dictates of Conscience, Morality, and Honour. In these Cases we ought to
consider, that it is not Custom, but Duty, which is the Rule of Action;
and that we should be only so far <i>sociable</i>, as we are reasonable
Creatures. Truth is never the less so, for not being attended to; and it
is the Nature of Actions, not the Number of Actors, by which we ought to
regulate our Behaviour. Singularity in Concerns of this Kind is to be
looked upon as heroick Bravery, in which a Man leaves the Species only
as he soars above it. What greater Instance can there be of a weak and
pusillanimous Temper, than for a Man to pass his whole Life in
Opposition to his own Sentiments? or not to dare to be what he thinks he
ought to be?<br>
<br>

Singularity therefore is only vicious when it makes Men act contrary to
Reason, or when it puts them upon distinguishing themselves by Trifles.
As for the first of these, who are singular in any thing that is
irreligious, immoral, or dishonourable, I believe every one will easily
give them up. I shall therefore speak of those only who are remarkable
for their Singularity in things of no Importance, as in Dress,
Behaviour, Conversation, and all the little Intercourses of Life. In
these Cases there is a certain Deference due to Custom; and
notwithstanding there may be a Colour of Reason to deviate from the
Multitude in some Particulars, a Man ought to sacrifice his private
Inclinations and Opinions to the Practice of the Publick. It must be
confessed that good Sense often makes a Humourist; but then it
unqualifies him for being of any Moment in the World, and renders him
ridiculous to Persons of a much inferiour Understanding.<br>
<br>
I have heard of a Gentleman in the North of <i>England</i>, who was a
remarkable Instance of this foolish Singularity. He had laid it down as
a Rule within himself, to act in the most indifferent Parts of Life
according to the most abstracted Notions of Reason and Good Sense,
without any Regard to Fashion or Example. This Humour broke out at first
in many little Oddnesses: He had never any stated Hours for his Dinner,
Supper or Sleep; because, said he, we ought to attend the Calls of
Nature, and not set our Appetites to our Meals, but bring our Meals to
our Appetites. In his Conversation with Country Gentlemen, he would not
make use of a Phrase that was not strictly true: He never told any of
them, that he was his humble Servant, but that he was his Well-wisher;
and would rather be thought a Malecontent, than drink the King's Health
when he was not a-dry. He would thrust his Head out of his
Chamber-Window every Morning, and after having gaped for fresh Air about
half an Hour, repeat fifty Verses as loud as he could bawl them for the
Benefit of his Lungs; to which End he generally took them out of
<i>Homer</i>; the <i>Greek</i> Tongue, especially in that Author, being more deep
and sonorous, and more conducive to Expectoration, than any other. He
had many other Particularities, for which he gave sound and
philosophical Reasons. As this Humour still grew upon him, he chose to
wear a Turban instead of a Perriwig; concluding very justly, that a
Bandage of clean Linnen about his Head was much more wholsome, as well
as cleanly, than the Caul of a Wig, which is soiled with frequent
Perspirations. He afterwards judiciously observed, that the many
Ligatures in our <i>English</i> Dress must naturally check the Circulation of
the Blood; for which Reason, he made his Breeches and his Doublet of one
continued Piece of Cloth, after the Manner of the <i>Hussars.</i> In short,
by following the pure Dictates of Reason, he at length departed so much
from the rest of his Countrymen, and indeed from his whole Species, that
his Friends would have clapped him into <i>Bedlam</i>, and have begged his
Estate; but the Judge being informed that he did no Harm, contented
himself with issuing out a Commission of Lunacy against him, and putting
his Estate into the Hands of proper Guardians.<br>
<br>
The Fate of this Philosopher puts me in Mind of a Remark in Monsieur
<i>Fontinell's</i> Dialogues of the Dead. <i>The Ambitious and the Covetous</i>
(says he) <i>are Madmen to all Intents and Purposes, as much as those who
are shut up in dark Rooms; but they have the good Luck to have Numbers
on their Side; whereas the Frenzy of one who is given up for a Lunatick,
is a Frenzy</i> hors d'oeuvre; that is, in other Words, something which is
singular in its Kind, and does not fall in with the Madness of a
Multitude.<br>
<br>
The Subject of this Essay was occasioned by a Letter which I received
not long since, and which, for want of Room at present, I shall insert
in my next Paper.<br>

The Letter mentioned in my last Paper is as follows.
<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <i><b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  'You have so lately decryed that Custom, too much in use among most
  People, of making themselves the Subjects of their Writings and
  Conversation, that I had some difficulty to perswade my self to give
  you this Trouble, till I had considered that tho' I should speak in
  the First Person, yet I could not be justly charged with Vanity, since
  I shall not add my Name; as also, because what I shall write will not,
  to say the best, redound to my Praise; but is only designed to remove
  a Prejudice conceived against me, as I hope, with very little
  Foundation. My short History is this.<br>
<br>
  I have lived for some Years last past altogether in <i>London</i>, till
  about a Month ago an Acquaintance of mine, for whom I have done some
  small Services in Town, invited me to pass part of the Summer with him
  at his House in the Country. I accepted his Invitation, and found a
  very hearty Welcome. My Friend, an honest plain Man, not being
  qualified to pass away his Time without the Reliefs of Business, has
  grafted the Farmer upon the Gentleman, and brought himself to submit
  even to the servile Parts of that Employment, such as inspecting his
  Plough, and the like. This necessarily takes up some of his Hours
  every Day; and as I have no Relish for such Diversions, I used at
  these Times to retire either to my Chamber, or a shady Walk near the
  House, and entertain my self with some agreeable Author. Now you must
  know, Mr. SPECTATOR, that when I read, especially if it be Poetry, it
  is very usual with me, when I meet with any Passage or Expression
  which strikes me much, to pronounce it aloud, with that Tone of the
  Voice which I think agreeable to the Sentiments there expressed; and
  to this I generally add some Motion or Action of the Body. It was not
  long before I was observed by some of the Family in one of these
  heroick Fits, who thereupon received Impressions very much to my
  Disadvantage. This however I did not soon discover, nor should have
  done probably, had it not been for the following Accident. I had one
  Day shut my self up in my Chamber, and was very deeply engaged in the
  Second Book of <i>Milton's Paradise Lost.</i> I walked to and fro with the
  Book in my Hand, and, to speak the Truth, I fear I made no little
  Noise; when presently coming to the following Lines,

<blockquote><i>&mdash;On a sudden open fly,<br>
With impetuous Recoil and jarring Sound,<br>
Th' infernal Doors, and on their Hinges grate<br>
Harsh Thunder, &amp;c.</i></blockquote>

  'I in great Transport threw open the Door of my Chamber, and found the
  greatest Part of the Family standing on the Out-side in a very great
  Consternation. I was in no less Confusion, and begged Pardon for
  having disturbed them; addressing my self particularly to comfort one
  of the Children, who received an unlucky fall in this Action, whilst
  he was too intently surveying my Meditations through the Key-hole. To
  be short, after this Adventure I easily observed that great Part of
  the Family, especially the Women and Children, looked upon me with
  some Apprehensions of Fear; and my Friend himself, tho' he still
  continued his Civilities to me, did not seem altogether easie: I took
  Notice, that the Butler was never after this Accident ordered to leave
  the Bottle upon the Table after Dinner. Add to this, that I frequently
  overheard the Servants mention me by the Name of the crazed Gentleman,
  the Gentleman a little touched, the mad <i>Londoner</i>, and the like. This
  made me think it high Time for me to shift my Quarters, which I
  resolved to do the first handsome Opportunity; and was confirmed in
  this Resolution by a young Lady in the Neighbourhood who frequently
  visited us, and who one Day, after having heard all the fine Things I
  was able to say, was pleased with a scornful Smile to bid me go to
  sleep.<br>
<br>
  'The first Minute I got to my Lodgings in Town I set Pen to Paper to
  de<b>Sir</b> e your Opinion, whether, upon the Evidence before you, I am mad
  or not. I can bring Certificates that I behave my self soberly before
  Company, and I hope there is at least some Merit in withdrawing to be
  mad. Look you, <b>Sir</b> , I am contented to be esteemed a little touched, as
  they phrase it, but should be sorry to be madder than my Neighbours;
  therefore, pray let me be as much in my Senses as you can afford. I
  know I could bring your self as an Instance of a Man who has confessed
  talking to himself; but yours is a particular Case, and cannot justify
  me, who have not kept Silence any Part of my Life. What if I should
  own my self in Love? You know Lovers are always allowed the Comfort of
  Soliloquy.&mdash;But I will say no more upon this Subject, because I have
  long since observed, the ready Way to be thought Mad is to contend
  that you are not so; as we generally conclude that Man drunk, who
  takes Pains to be thought sober. I will therefore leave my self to
  your Determination; but am the more de<b>Sir</b> ous to be thought in my
  Senses, that it may be no Discredit to you when I assure you that I
  have always been very much<br>
<br>
  <i>Your Admirer.<br>
<br>
  P.S. If I must be mad, I de<b>Sir</b> e the young Lady may believe it is for
  her.</i><br>
<br>

<br>
 <i> The humble Petition of</i> John a Nokes <i>and</i> John a Stiles, <i>Sheweth.</i><br>
<br>
  'That your Petitioners have had Causes depending in <i>Westminster-Hall</i>
  above five hundred Years, and that we despair of ever seeing them
  brought to an Issue: That your Petitioners have not been involved in
  these Law Suits, out of any litigious Temper of their own, but by the
  Instigation of contentious Persons; that the young Lawyers in our Inns
  of Court are continually setting us together by the Ears, and think
  they do us no Hurt, because they plead for us without a Fee; That many
  of the Gentlemen of the Robe have no other Clients in the World
  besides us two; That when they have nothing else to do, they make us
  Plaintiffs and Defendants, tho' they were never retained by either of
  us; That they traduce, condemn, or acquit us, without any manner of
  Regard to our Reputations and good Names in the World. Your
  Petitioners therefore (being thereunto encouraged by the favourable
  Reception which you lately gave to our Kinsman <i>Blank</i>) do humbly
  pray, that you will put an End to the Controversies which have been so
  long depending between us your said Petitioners, and that our Enmity
  may not endure from Generation to Generation; it being our Resolution
  to live hereafter as it becometh Men of peaceable Dispositions.<br>
<br>
  <i>And your Petitioners (as in Duty bound) shall ever Pray, &amp;c.</i></blockquote><br>

There has been very great Reason, on several Accounts, for the learned
World to endeavour at settling what it was that might be said to compose
<i>personal Identity.</i><br>
<br>
Mr. <i>Lock</i>, after having premised that the Word <i>Person</i> properly
signifies a thinking intelligent Being that has Reason and Reflection,
and can consider it self as it self; concludes That it is Consciousness
alone, and not an Identity of Substance, which makes this personal
Identity of Sameness. Had I the same Consciousness (says that Author)
that I saw the Ark and <i>Noah's</i> Flood, as that I saw an Overflowing of
the <i>Thames</i> last Winter; or as that I now write; I could no more doubt
that I who write this now, that saw the <i>Thames</i> overflow last Winter,
and that viewed the Flood at the general Deluge, was the same <i>Self</i>,
place that <i>Self</i> in what Substance you please, than that I who write
this am the same <i>My self</i> now whilst I write, (whether I consist of all
the same Substance material or immaterial or no) that I was Yesterday;
For as to this Point of being the same <i>Self</i>, it matters not whether
this present <i>Self</i> be made up of the same or other Substances.<br>
<br>
I was mightily pleased with a Story in some Measure applicable to this
Piece of Philosophy, which I read the other Day in the <i>Persian Tales</i>,
as they are lately very well translated by Mr. <i>Philips</i>; and with an
Abridgement whereof I shall here present my Readers.<br>
<br>
I shall only premise that these Stories are writ after the Eastern
Manner, but somewhat more correct.<br>
<br>

<br>
'<i>Fadlallah</i>, a Prince of great Virtues, succeeded his Father
<i>Bin-Ortoc</i>, in the Kingdom of <i>Mousel</i>. He reigned over his faithful
Subjects for some time, and lived in great Happiness with his beauteous
Consort Queen <i>Zemroude</i>; when there appeared at his Court a young
<i>Dervis</i> of so lively and entertaining a Turn of Wit, as won upon the
Affections of every one he conversed with. His Reputation grew so fast
every Day, that it at last raised a Curiosity in the Prince himself to
see and talk with him. He did so, and far from finding that common Fame
had flatter'd him, he was soon convinced that every thing he had heard
of him fell short of the Truth.<br>
<br>
'<i>Fadlallah</i> immediately lost all Manner of Relish for the Conversation
of other Men; and as he was every Day more and more satisfied of the
Abilities of this Stranger, offered him the first Posts in his Kingdom.
The young <i>Dervis</i>, after having thanked him with a very singular
Modesty, de<b>Sir</b> ed to be excused, as having made a Vow never to accept of
any Employment, and preferring a free and independent State of Life to
all other Conditions.<br>
<br>
'The King was infinitely charmed with so great an Example of Moderation;
and tho' he could not get him to engage in a Life of Business, made him
however his chief Companion and first Favourite.<br>
<br>
'As they were one Day hunting together, and happened to be separated
from the rest of the Company, the <i>Dervis</i> entertained <i>Fadlallah</i> with
an Account of his Travels and Adventures. After having related to him
several Curiosities which he had seen in the <i>Indies</i>, <i>It was in this
Place</i>, says he, <i>that I contracted an Acquaintance with an old</i>
Brachman, <i>who was skilled in the most hidden Powers of Nature: He died
within my Arms, and with his parting Breath communicated to me one of
the most valuable of his Secrets, on Condition I should never reveal it
to any Man</i>. The King immediately reflecting on his young Favourite's
having refused the late Offers of Greatness he had made him, told him he
presumed it was the Power of making Gold. <i>No <b>Sir</b> </i>, says the <i>Dervis</i>,
<i>it is somewhat more wonderful than that; it is the Power of
re-animating a dead Body, by flinging my own Soul into it</i>.<br>
<br>
'While he was yet speaking a Doe came bounding by them; and the King,
who had his Bow ready, shot her through the Heart; telling the <i>Dervis</i>,
that a fair Opportunity now offered for him to show his Art. The young
Man immediately left his own Body breathless on the Ground, while at the
same Instant that of the Doe was re-animated, she came to the King,
fawned upon him, and after having play'd several wanton Tricks, fell
again upon the Grass; at the same Instant the Body of the <i>Dervis</i>
recovered its Life. The King was infinitely pleased at so uncommon an
Operation, and conjured his Friend by every thing that was sacred to
communicate it to him. The <i>Dervis</i> at first made some Scruple of
violating his Promise to the dying <i>Brachman</i>; but told him at last that
he found he could conceal nothing from so excellent a Prince; after
having obliged him therefore by an Oath to Secrecy, he taught him to
repeat two Cabalistick Words, in pronouncing of which the whole Secret
consisted. The King, impatient to try the Experiment, immediately
repeated them as he had been taught, and in an Instant found himself in
the Body of the Doe. He had but little Time to contemplate himself in
this new Being; for the treacherous <i>Dervis</i> shooting his own Soul into
the Royal Corps, and bending the Prince's own Bow against him, had laid
him dead on the Spot, had not the King, who perceiv'd his Intent, fled
swiftly to the Woods.<br>
<br>
'The <i>Dervis</i>, now triumphant in his Villany, returned to <i>Mousel</i>, and
filled the Throne and Bed of the unhappy <i>Fadlallah</i>.<br>
<br>
'The first thing he took Care of, in order to secure himself in the
Possession of his new-acquired Kingdom, was to issue out a Proclamation,
ordering his Subjects to destroy all the Deer in the Realm. The King had
perished among the rest, had he not avoided his Pursuers by re-animating
the Body of a Nightingale which he saw lie dead at the Foot of a Tree.
In this new Shape he winged his Way in Safety to the Palace, where
perching on a Tree which stood near his Queen's Apartment, he filled the
whole Place with so many melodious and Melancholy Notes as drew her to
the Window. He had the Mortification to see that instead of being
pitied, he only moved the Mirth of his Princess, and of a young Female
Slave who was with her. He continued however to serenade her every
Morning, 'till at last the Queen, charmed with his Harmony, sent for the
Bird-catchers, and ordered them to employ their utmost Skill to put that
little Creature into her Possession. The King, pleased with an
Opportunity of being once more near his beloved Consort, easily suffered
himself to be taken; and when he was presented to her, tho' he shewed a
Fearfulness to be touched by any of the other Ladies, flew of his own
Accord, and hid himself in the Queen's Bosom. <i>Zemroude</i> was highly
pleased at the unexpected Fondness of her new Favourite, and ordered him
to be kept in an open Cage in her own Apartment. He had there an
Opportunity of making his Court to her every Morning, by a thousand
little Actions which his Shape allowed him. The Queen passed away whole
Hours every Day in hearing and playing with him. <i>Fadlallah</i> could even
have thought himself happy in this State of Life, had he not frequently
endured the inexpressible Torment of seeing the <i>Dervis</i> enter the
Apartment and caress his Queen even in his Presence.<br>
<br>
The Usurper, amidst his toying with the Princess, would often endeavour
to ingratiate himself with her Nightingale; and while the enraged
<i>Fadlallah</i> peck'd at him with his Bill, beat his Wings, and shewed all
the Marks of an impotent Rage, it only afforded his Rival and the Queen
new Matter for their Diversion.<br>
<br>
<i>Zemroude</i> was likewise fond of a little Lap-Dog which she kept in her
Apartment, and which one Night happened to die.<br>
<br>
The King immediately found himself inclined to quit the shape of the
Nightingale, and enliven this new Body. He did so, and the next Morning
<i>Zemroude</i> saw her favourite Bird lie dead in the Cage. It is impossible
to express her Grief on this Occasion, and when she called to mind all
its little Actions, which even appeared to have somewhat in them like
Reason, she was inconsolable for her Loss.<br>
<br>
Her Women immediately sent for the <i>Dervis</i>, to come and comfort her,
who after having in vain represented to her the Weakness of being
grieved at such an Accident, touched at last by her repeated Complaints;
<i>Well Madam</i>, says he, <i>I will exert the utmost of my Art to please you.
Your Nightingale shall again revive every Morning and serenade you as
before</i>. The Queen beheld him with a Look which easily shewed she did
not believe him; when laying himself down on a Sofa, he shot his Soul
into the Nightingale, and <i>Zemroude</i> was amazed to see her Bird revive.<br>
<br>
'The King, who was a <b>Spectator</b> of all that passed, lying under the Shape
of a Lap-Dog, in one Corner of the Room, immediately recovered his own
Body, and running to the Cage with the utmost Indignation, twisted off
the Neck of the false Nightingale.<br>
<br>
'<i>Zemroude</i> was more than ever amazed and concerned at this second
Accident, 'till the King entreating her to hear him, related to her his
whole Adventure.<br>
<br>
'The Body of the <i>Dervis</i>, which was found dead in the Wood, and his
Edict for killing all the Deer, left her no Room to doubt of the Truth
of it: But the Story adds, That out of an extream Delicacy (peculiar to
the Oriental Ladies) she was so highly afflicted at the innocent
Adultery in which she had for some time lived with the <i>Dervis</i>, that no
Arguments even from <i>Fadlallah</i> himself could compose her Mind. She
shortly after died with Grief, begging his Pardon with her last Breath
for what the most rigid Justice could not have interpreted as a Crime.<br>
<br>
'The King was so afflicted with her Death, that he left his Kingdom to
one of his nearest Relations, and passed the rest of his Days in
Solitude and Retirement.<br>

<br>

In the Reign of King <i>Charles</i> I., the Company of Stationers, into whose
Hands the Printing of the Bible is committed by Patent, made a very
remarkable <i>Erratum</i> or Blunder in one of their Editions: For instead of
<i>Thou shalt not commit Adultery</i>, they printed off several thousands of
Copies with <i>Thou shalt commit Adultery</i>. Archbishop <i>Laud</i>, to punish
this their Negligence, laid a considerable Fine upon that Company in the
<i>Star-Chamber.</i><br>
<br>
By the Practice of the World, which prevails in this degenerate Age, I
am afraid that very many young Profligates, of both Sexes, are possessed
of this spurious Edition of the Bible, and observe the Commandment
according to that faulty Reading.<br>
<br>
Adulterers, in the first Ages of the Church, were excommunicated for
ever, and unqualified all their Lives from bearing a Part in Christian
Assemblies, notwithstanding they might seek it with Tears, and all the
Appearances of the most unfeigned Repentance.<br>
<br>
I might here mention some ancient Laws among the Heathens which punished
this Crime with Death: and others of the same Kind, which are now in
Force among several Governments that have embraced the Reformed
Religion. But because a Subject of this Nature may be too serious for my
ordinary Readers, who are very apt to throw by my Papers, when they are
not enlivened with something that is diverting or uncommon; I shall here
publish the Contents of a little Manuscript lately fallen into my Hands,
and which pretends to great Antiquity, tho' by Reason of some modern
Phrases and other Particulars in it, I can by no means allow it to be
genuine, but rather the Production of a Modern Sophist.<br>
<br>
It is well known by the Learned, that there was a Temple upon Mount
<i>&AElig;tna</i> dedicated to <i>Vulcan</i>, which was guarded by Dogs of so exquisite
a Smell, (say the Historians) that they could discern whether the
Persons who came thither were chast or otherwise. They used to meet and
faun upon such as were chast, caressing them as the Friends of their
Master <i>Vulcan</i>; but flew at those who were polluted, and never ceased
barking at them till they had driven them from the Temple.<br>
<br>
My Manuscript gives the following Account of these Dogs, and was
probably designed as a Comment upon this Story.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
'These Dogs were given to <i>Vulcan</i> by his Sister <i>Diana</i>, the Goddess of
Hunting and of Chastity, having bred them out of some of her Hounds, in
which she had observed this natural Instinct and Sagacity. It was
thought she did it in Spight to <i>Venus</i>, who, upon her Return home,
always found her Husband in a good or bad Humour, according to the
Reception which she met with from his Dogs. They lived in the Temple
several Years, but were such snappish Curs that they frighted away most
of the Votaries. The Women of <i>Sicily</i> made a solemn Deputation to the
Priest, by which they acquainted him, that they would not come up to the
Temple with their annual Offerings unless he muzzled his Mastiffs; and
at last comprimised the Matter with him, that the Offering should always
be brought by a Chorus of young Girls, who were none of them above seven
Years old. It was wonderful (says the Author) to see how different the
Treatment was which the Dogs gave to these little Misses, from that
which they had shown to their Mothers. It is said that the Prince of
<i>Syracuse</i>, having married a young Lady, and being naturally of a
jealous Temper, made such an Interest with the Priests of this Temple,
that he procured a Whelp from them of this famous Breed. The young Puppy
was very troublesome to the fair Lady at first, insomuch that she
sollicited her Husband to send him away, but the good Man cut her short
with the old <i>Sicilian</i> Proverb, <i>Love me love my Dog</i>. From which Time
she lived very peaceably with both of them. The Ladies of <i>Syracuse</i>
were very much annoyed with him, and several of very good Reputation
refused to come to Court till he was discarded. There were indeed some
of them that defied his Sagacity, but it was observed, though he did not
actually bite them, he would growle at them most confoundedly. To return
to the Dogs of the Temple: After they had lived here in great Repute for
several Years, it so happened, that as one of the Priests, who had been
making a charitable Visit to a Widow who lived on the Promontory of
<i>Lilybeum</i>, return'd home pretty late in the Evening, the Dogs flew at
him with so much Fury, that they would have worried him if his Brethren
had not come in to his Assistance: Upon which, says my Author, the Dogs
were all of them hanged, as having lost their original Instinct.<br>
<br>
I cannot conclude this Paper without wishing, that we had some of this
Breed of Dogs in <i>Great Britain</i>, which would certainly do <i>Justice</i>, I
should say <i>Honour</i>, to the Ladies of our Country, and shew the World
the difference between Pagan Women and those who are instructed in
sounder Principles of Virtue and Religion.<br>

<blockquote><i>&mdash;Si verbo audacia detur,<br>
  Non metuam magni dixisse palatia Coeli.</i><br>
<br>
Ovid. <i>Met.</i><a href="transindex.html#580t"><img src="images/qmark.png" width="15" height="15" align="right" alt="translation"></a><br>
<br>

<br>
  <i><b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  '<a name="fr5801">I</a> considered in my two last Letters<a href="#f5801"><sup>1</sup></a> that awful and tremendous
  Subject, the Ubiquity or Omnipresence of the Divine Being. I have
  shewn that he is equally present in all Places throughout the whole
  Extent of infinite Space.<br>
<br>
  'This Doctrine is so agreeable to Reason, that we meet with it in the
  Writings of the enlightened Heathens, as I might show at large, were
  it not already done by other Hands. But tho' the Deity be thus
  essentially present through all the Immensity of Space, there is one
  Part of it in which he discovers himself in a most transcendent and
  visible Glory. This is that Place which is marked out in Scripture
  under the different Appellations of <i>Paradise, the third Heaven, the
  Throne of God</i>, and <i>the Habitation of his Glory</i>. It is here where
  the glorified Body of our Saviour resides, and where all the celestial
  Hierarchies, and the innumerable Hosts of Angels, are represented as
  perpetually surrounding the Seat of God with <i>Hallelujahs</i> and Hymns
  of Praise. This is that Presence of God which some of the Divines call
  his Glorious, and others his Majestatick Presence. He is indeed as
  essentially present in all other Places as in this, but it is here
  where he resides in a sensible Magnificence, and in the midst of those
  Splendors which can affect the Imagination of created Beings.<br>
<br>
  'It is very remarkable that this Opinion of God Almighty's Presence in
  Heaven, whether discovered by the Light of Nature, or by a general
  Tradition from our first Parents, prevails among all the Nations of
  the World, whatsoever different Notions they entertain of the Godhead.
  If you look into <i>Homer</i>, that is, the most ancient of the <i>Greek</i>
  Writers, you see the supreme Powers seated in the Heavens, and
  encompassed with inferior Deities, among whom the Muses are
  represented as singing incessantly about his Throne. Who does not here
  see the main Strokes and Outlines of this great Truth we are speaking
  of? The same Doctrine is shadowed out in many other Heathen Authors,
  tho' at the same time, like several other revealed Truths, dashed and
  adulterated with a mixture of Fables and human Inventions. But to pass
  over the Notions of the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i>, those more enlightened
  Parts of the Pagan World, we find there is scarce a People among the
  late discovered Nations who are not trained up in an Opinion, that
  Heaven is the Habitation of the Divinity whom they worship.<br>
<br>
As in <i>Solomon's</i> Temple there was the <i>Sanctum Sanctorum</i>, in which a
visible Glory appeared among the Figures of the Cherubims, and into
which none but the High Priest himself was permitted to enter, after
having made an Atonement for the Sins of the People; so if we consider
the whole Creation as one great Temple, there is in it this Holy of
Holies, into which the High-Priest of our Salvation entered, and took
his Place among Angels and Archangels, after having made a Propitiation
for the Sins of Mankind.<br>
<br>
'With how much Skill must the Throne of God be erected? With what
glorious Designs is that Habitation beautified, which is contrived and
built by him who inspired <i>Hyram</i> with Wisdom? How great must be the
Majesty of that Place, where the whole Art of Creation has been
employed, and where God has chosen to show himself in the most
magnificent manner? What must be the Architecture of Infinite Power
under the Direction of Infinite Wisdom? A Spirit cannot but be
transported, after an ineffable manner, with the sight of those Objects,
which were made to affect him by that Being who knows the inward Frame
of a Soul, and how to please and ravish it in all its most secret Powers
and Faculties. It is to this Majestic Presence of God, we may apply
those beautiful Expressions in holy Writ: <i>Behold even to the Moon, and
it shineth not; yea the Stars are not pure in his sight.</i> The Light of
the Sun, and all the Glories of the World in which we live, are but as
weak and sickly Glimmerings, or rather Darkness itself, in Comparison of
those Splendors which encompass the Throne of God.<br>
<br>
'As the <i>Glory</i> of this Place is transcendent beyond Imagination, so
probably is the <i>Extent</i> of it. There is Light behind Light, and Glory
within Glory. How far that Space may reach, in which God thus appears in
perfect Majesty, we cannot possibly conceive. Tho' it is not infinite,
it may be indefinite; and though not immeasurable in its self, it may be
so with regard to any created Eye or Imagination. If he has made these
lower Regions of Matter so inconceivably wide and magnificent for the
Habitation of mortal and perishable Beings, how great may we suppose the
Courts of his House to be, where he makes his Residence in a more
especial manner, and displays himself in the Fulness of his Glory, among
an innumerable Company of Angels, and Spirits of just Men made perfect?<br>
<br>
'This is certain, that our Imaginations cannot be raised too high, when
we think on a Place where Omnipotence and Omniscience have so signally
exerted themselves, because that they are able to produce a Scene
infinitely more great and glorious than what we are able to imagine. It
is not impossible but at the Consummation of all Things, these outward
Apartments of Nature, which are now suited to those Beings who inhabit
them, may be taken in and added to that glorious Place of which I am
here speaking; and by that means made a proper Habitation for Beings who
are exempt from Mortality, and cleared of their Imperfections: For so
the Scripture seems to intimate when it speaks of new Heavens and of a
new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteousness.<br>
<br>
'I have only considered this Glorious Place, with Regard to the Sight
and Imagination, though it is highly probable that our other Senses may
here likewise enjoy their highest Gratifications. There is nothing which
more ravishes and transports the Soul, than Harmony; and we have great
Reason to believe, from the Descriptions of this Place in Holy
Scripture, that this is one of the Entertainments of it. And if the Soul
of Man can be so wonderfully affected with those Strains of Musick,
which Human Art is capable of producing, how much more will it be raised
and elevated by those, in which is exerted the whole Power of Harmony!
The Senses are Faculties of the Human Soul, though they cannot be
employed, during this our vital Union, without proper Instruments in the
Body. Why therefore should we exclude the Satisfaction of these
Faculties, which we find by Experience are Inlets of great Pleasure to
the Soul, from among those Entertainments which are to make up our
Happiness hereafter? Why should we suppose that our Hearing and Seeing
will not be gratify'd with those Objects which are most agreeable to
them, and which they cannot meet with in these lower Regions of Nature;
Objects, <i>which neither Eye hath seen, nor Ear heard, nor can it enter
into the Heart of Man to conceive? I knew a Man in Christ</i> (says St
Paul, speaking of himself) <i>above fourteen Years ago (whether in the
Body, I cannot tell, or whether out of the Body, I cannot tell: God
knoweth) such a one caught up to the third Heaven. And I knew such a
Man, (whether in the Body, or out of the Body, I cannot tell: God
knoweth,) how that he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable
Words, which it is not possible for a Man to utter.</i> By this is meant,
that what he heard was so infinitely different from any thing which he
had heard in this World, that it was impossible to express it in such
Words as might convey a Notion of it to his Hearers.<br>
<br>
'It is very natural for us to take Delight in Enquiries concerning any
Foreign Country, where we are some Time or other to make our Abode; and
as we all hope to be admitted into this Glorious Place, it is both a
laudable and useful Curiosity, to get what Informations we can of it,
whilst we make Use of Revelation for our Guide. When these everlasting
Doors shall be open to us, we may be sure that the Pleasures and
Beauties of this Place will infinitely transcend our present Hopes and
Expectations, and that the glorious Appearance of the Throne of God,
will rise infinitely beyond whatever we are able to conceive of it. We
might here entertain our selves with many other Speculations on this
Subject, from those several Hints which we find of it in the Holy
Scriptures; as whether there may not be different Mansions and
Apartments of Glory, to Beings of different Natures; whether as they
excel one another in Perfection, they are not admitted nearer to the
Throne of the Almighty, and enjoy greater Manifestations of his
Presence; whether there are not solemn Times and Occasions, when all the
Multitude of Heaven celebrate the Presence of their Maker in more
extraordinary Forms of Praise and Adoration; as <i>Adam</i>, though he had
continued in a State of Innocence, would, in the Opinion of our Divines,
have kept Holy the Sabbath-Day, in a more particular Manner than any
other of the Seven. These, and the like Speculations, we may very
innocently indulge, so long as we make use of them to inspire us with a
De<b>Sir</b> e of becoming Inhabitants of this delightful Place.<br>
<br>
'I have in this, and in two foregoing Letters, treated on the most
serious Subject that can employ the Mind of Man, the Omnipresence of the
Deity; a Subject which, if possible, should never depart from our
Meditations. We have considered the Divine Being, as he inhabits
Infinitude, as he dwells among his Work, as he is present to the Mind of
Man, and as he discovers himself in a more glorious Manner among the
Regions of the Blest. Such a Consideration should be kept awake in us at
all Times, and in all Places, and possess our Minds with a perpetual Awe
and Reverence. It should be interwoven with all our Thoughts and
Perceptions, and become one with the Consciousness of our own Being. It
is not to be reflected on in the Coldness of Philosophy, but ought to
sink us into the lowest Prostration before him, who is so astonishingly
Great, Wonderful, and Holy.'</blockquote>

I am at present sitting with a Heap of Letters before me, which I have
received under the Character of SPECTATOR; I have Complaints from
Lovers, Schemes from Projectors, Scandal from Ladies, Congratulations,
Compliments, and Advice in abundance.<br>
<br>
I have not been thus long an Author, to be insensible of the natural
Fondness every Person must have for their own Productions; and I begin
to think I have treated my Correspondents a little too uncivilly in
Stringing them all together on a File, and letting them lye so long
unregarded. I shall therefore, for the future, think my self at least
obliged to take some Notice of such Letters as I receive, and may
possibly do it at the end of every Month.<br>
<br>
In the mean time, I intend my present Paper as a short Answer to most of
those which have been already sent me.<br>
<br>
The Publick however is not to expect I should let them into all my
Secrets; and though I appear abstruse to most People, it is sufficient
if I am understood by my particular Correspondents.<br>
<br>
My Well-wisher <i>Van Nath</i> is very arch, but not quite enough so to
appear in Print.<br>
<br>
<i>Philadelphus</i> will, in a little time, see his Query fully answered by a
Treatise which is now in the Press.<br>
<br>
It was very improper at that time to comply with Mr. <i>G.</i><br>
<br>
Miss <i>Kitty</i> must excuse me.<br>
<br>
The Gentleman who sent me a Copy of Verses on his Mistress's Dancing, is
I believe too thoroughly in Love to compose correctly.<br>
<br>
I have too great a Respect for both the Universities to praise one at
the Expence of the other.<br>
<br>
<i>Tom Nimble</i> is a very honest Fellow, and I de<b>Sir</b> e him to present my
humble Service to his Cousin <i>Fill Bumper</i>.<br>
<br>
I am obliged for the Letter upon Prejudice.<br>
<br>
I may in due time animadvert on the Case of <i>Grace Grumble</i>.<br>
<br>
The Petition of <i>P. S. granted.</i><br>
<br>
That of <i>Sarah Loveit, refused.</i><br>
<br>
The Papers of<i> A. S.</i> are returned.<br>
<br>
I thank <i>Aristippus</i> for his kind Invitation.<br>
<br>
My Friend at <i>Woodstock</i> is a bold Man, to undertake for all within Ten
Miles of him.<br>
<br>
I am afraid the Entertainment of <i>Tom Turnover</i> will hardly be relished
by the good Cities of <i>London</i> and <i>Westminster.</i><br>
<br>
I must consider further of it, before I indulge <i>W. F</i>. in those
Freedoms he takes with the Ladies Stockings.<br>
<br>
I am obliged to the ingenious Gentleman, who sent me an Ode on the
Subject of a late SPECTATOR, and shall take particular Notice of his
last Letter.<br>
<br>
When the Lady who wrote me a Letter, dated <i>July</i> the 20th, in relation
to some Passages in a <i>Lover</i>, will be more particular in her
Directions, I shall be so in my Answer.<br>
<br>
The poor Gentleman, who fancies my Writings could reclaim an Husband who
can abuse such a Wife as he describes, has I am afraid too great an
Opinion of my Skill.<br>
<br>
<i>Philanthropos</i> is, I dare say, a very well-meaning Man, but a little
too prolix in his Compositions.<br>
<br>
<i>Constantius</i> himself must be the best Judge in the Affair he mentions.<br>
<br>
The Letter dated from <i>Lincoln</i> is received.<br>
<br>
<i>Arethusa</i> and her Friend may hear further from me.<br>
<br>
<i>Celia</i> is a little too hasty.<br>

<br>
<i>Harriot</i> is a good Girl, but must not Curtsie to Folks she does not
know.<br>
<br>
I must ingeniously confess my Friend <i>Sampson Bentstaff </i>has quite
puzzled me, and writ me a long Letter which I cannot comprehend one Word
of.<br>
<br>
<i>Collidan</i> must also explain what he means by his <i>Drigelling.</i><br>
<br>
I think it beneath my <i>Spectatorial</i> Dignity, to concern my self in the
Affair of the boiled Dumpling.<br>
<br>
I shall consult some <i>Litterati</i> on the Project sent me for the
Discovery of the Longitude.<br>
<br>
I know not how to conclude this Paper better, than by inserting a Couple
of Letters which are really genuine, and which I look upon to be two of
the smartest Pieces I have received from my Correspondents of either Sex.<br>

There is a certain Distemper, which is mentioned neither by <i>Galen</i> nor
<i>Hippocrates</i>, nor to be met with in the <i>London Dispensary</i>. <i>Juvenal</i>,
in the Motto of my Paper, terms it a <i>Cac&oelig;thes</i>; which is a hard Word
for a Disease called in plain <i>English</i>, the <i>Itch of Writing.</i> This
<i>Cac&oelig;thes</i> is as Epidemical as the Small-Pox, there being very few who
are not seized with it some time or other in their Lives. There is,
however, this Difference in these two Distempers, that the first, after
having indisposed you for a time, never returns again; whereas this I am
speaking of, when it is once got into the Blood, seldom comes out of it.
The <i>British</i> Nation is very much afflicted with this Malady, and tho'
very many Remedies have been applied to Persons infected with it, few of
them have ever proved successful. Some have been cauterized with Satyrs
and Lampoons, but have received little or no Benefit from them; others
have had their Heads fastned for an Hour together between a Cleft Board,
which is made use <a name="fr5821">of</a> as a Cure for the Disease when it appears in its
greatest Malignity<a href="#f5821"><sup>1</sup></a>. There is indeed one kind of this Malady which
has been sometimes removed, like the Biting of a <i>Tarantula</i>, with the
sound of a musical Instrument, which is commonly known by the Name of a
Cat-Call. But if you have a Patient of this kind under your Care, you
may assure your self there is no other way of recovering him
effectually, but by forbidding him the use of Pen, Ink and Paper.<br>
<br>
But to drop the Allegory before I have tired it out, there is no Species
of Scriblers more offensive, and more incurable, than your Periodical
Writers, whose Works return upon the Publick on certain Days and at
stated Times. We have not the Consolation in the Perusal of these
Authors, which we find at the reading of all others, (namely) that we
are sure if we have but Patience, we may come to the End of their
Labours. I have often admired a humorous Saying of <i>Diogenes</i>, who
reading a dull Author to several of his Friends, when every one began to
be tired, finding he was almost come to a blank leaf at the End of it,
cried, <i>Courage, Lads, I see Land</i>. On the contrary, our Progress
through that kind of Writers I am now speaking of is never at an End.
One Day makes Work for another, we do not know when to promise our
selves Rest.<br>
<br>
It is a melancholy thing to consider, that the Art of Printing, which
might be the greatest Blessing to Mankind, should prove detrimental to
us, and that it should be made use of to scatter Prejudice and Ignorance
through a People, instead of conveying to them Truth and Knowledge.<br>
<br>
I was lately reading a very whimsical Treatise, entitled, <i>William
Ramsey's</i> Vindication of Astrology. This profound Author, among many
mystical Passages, has the following one:

<blockquote><i>The Absence of the Sun is not the Cause of Night, forasmuch
as his Light is so great that it may illuminate the Earth all
over at once as clear as broad Day, but there are tenebrificous
and dark Stars, by whose Influence Night is brought on, and
which do ray out Darkness and Obscurity upon the Earth, as
the Sun does Light.</i></blockquote>

I consider Writers in the same View this sage Astrologer does the
Heavenly Bodies. Some of them are Stars that scatter Light as others do
Darkness. I could mention several Authors who are tenebrificous Stars of
the first Magnitude, and point out a Knot of Gentlemen, who have been
dull in Consort, and may be looked upon as a dark Constellation. The
Nation has been a great while benighted with several of these
Antiluminaries. I suffered them to ray out their Darkness as long as I
was able to endure it, till at length I came to a Resolution of rising
upon them, and hope in a little time to drive them quite out of the
<i>British</i> Hemisphere.<br>

<br>

Every Station of Life has Duties which are proper to it. Those who are
determined by Choice to any particular kind of Business, are indeed more
happy than those who are determined by Necessity, but both are under an
equal Obligation of fixing on Employments, which may be either useful to
themselves or beneficial to others. No one of the Sons of <i>Adam</i> ought
to think himself exempt from that Labour and Industry which were
denounced to our first Parent, and in him to all his Posterity. Those to
whom Birth or Fortune may seem to make such an Application unnecessary,
ought to find out some Calling or Profession for themselves, that they
may not lie as a Burden on the Species, and be the only useless Parts of
the Creation.<br>
<br>
Many of our Country Gentlemen in their busie Hours apply themselves
wholly to the Chase, or to some other Diversion which they find in the
Fields and Woods. This gave occasion to one of our most eminent
<i>English</i> Writers to represent every one of them as lying under a kind
of Curse pronounced to them in the Words of <i>Goliah, I will give thee to
the Fowls of the Air, and to the Beasts of the Field.</i><br>
<br>
Tho' Exercises of this kind, when indulged with Moderation, may have a
good Influence both on the Mind and Body, the Country affords many other
Amusements of a more noble kind.<br>
<br>
Among these I know none more delightful in itself, and beneficial to the
Publick, than that of <b><i>Planting.</i></b> I could mention a Nobleman whose
Fortune has placed him in several Parts of <i>England</i>, and who has always
left these visible Marks behind him, which show he has been there: He
never hired a House in his Life, without leaving all about it the Seeds
of Wealth, and bestowing Legacies on the Posterity of the Owner. Had all
the Gentlemen of <i>England</i> made the same Improvements upon their
Estates, our whole Country would have been at this time as one great
Garden. Nor ought such an Employment to be looked upon as too inglorious
for Men of the highest Rank. There have been Heroes in this Art, as well
as in others. We are told in particular of <i>Cyrus</i> the Great, that he
planted all the Lesser <i>Asia.</i> There is indeed something truly
magnificent in this kind of Amusement: It gives a nobler Air to several
Parts of Nature; it fills the Earth with a Variety of beautiful Scenes,
and has something in it like Creation. For this Reason the Pleasure of
one who Plants is something like that of a Poet, who, as <i>Aristotle</i>
observes, is more delighted with his Productions than any other Writer
or Artist whatsoever.<br>
<br>
Plantations have one Advantage in them which is not to be found in most
other Works, as they give a Pleasure of a more lasting Date, and
continually improve in the Eye of the Planter, When you have finished a
Building or any other Undertaking of the like Nature, it immediately
decays upon your Hands; you see it brought to its utmost Point of
Perfection, and from that time hastening to its Ruin. On the contrary,
when you have finished your Plantations, they are still arriving at
greater Degrees of Perfection as long as you live, and appear more
delightful in every succeeding Year than they did in the foregoing.<br>
<br>
But I do not only recommend this Art to Men of Estates as a pleasing
Amusement, but as it is a kind of Virtuous Employment, and may therefore
be inculcated by moral Motives; particularly from the Love which we
ought to have for our Country, and the Regard which we ought to bear to
our Posterity. As for the first, I need only mention what is frequently
observed by others, that the Increase of Forest-Trees does by no Means
bear a Proportion to the Destruction of them, insomuch that in a few
Ages the Nation may be at a Loss to supply it self with Timber
sufficient for the Fleets of <i>England.</i> I know when a Man talks of
Posterity in Matters of this Nature, he is looked upon with an Eye of
Ridicule by the cunning and selfish part of Mankind. Most People are of
the Humour of an old Fellow of a College, who, when he was pressed by
the Society to come into something that might redound to the good of
their Successors, grew very peevish, <i>We are always doing</i>, says he,
<i>something for Posterity, but I would fain see Posterity do something
for us.</i><br>
<br>
But I think Men are inexcusable, who fail in a Duty of this Nature,
since it is so easily discharged. When a Man considers that the putting
a few Twigs into the Ground, is doing good to one who will make his
appearance in the World about Fifty Years hence, or that he is perhaps
making one of his own Descendants easy or rich, by so inconsiderable an
Expence, if he finds himself averse to it, he must conclude that he has
a poor and base Heart, void of all generous Principles and Love to
Mankind.<br>
<br>
There is one Consideration, which may very much enforce what I have here
said. Many honest Minds that are naturally disposed to do good in the
World, and become Beneficial to Mankind, complain within themselves that
they have not Talents for it. This therefore is a good Office, which is
suited to the meanest Capacities, and which may be performed by
Multitudes, who have not Abilities sufficient to deserve well of their
Country and to recommend themselves to their Posterity, by any other
Method. It is the Phrase of a Friend of mine, when any useful Country
Neighbour dies, that <i>you may trace him:</i> which I look upon as a good
Funeral Oration, at the Death of an honest Husbandman, who hath left the
Impressions of his Industry behind him, in the Place where he has lived.<br>
<br>
Upon the foregoing Considerations, I can scarce forbear representing the
Subject of this Paper as a kind of Moral Virtue: Which, as I have
already shown, recommends it self likewise by the Pleasure that attends
it. It must be confessed, that this is none of those turbulent Pleasures
which is apt to gratifie a Man in the Heats of Youth; but if it be not
so Tumultuous, it is more lasting. Nothing can be more delightful than
to entertain ourselves with Prospects of our own making, and to walk
under those Shades which our own Industry has raised. Amusements of this
Nature compose the Mind, and lay at Rest all those Passions which are
uneasie to the Soul of Man, besides that they naturally engender good
Thoughts, and dispose us to laudable Contemplations. Many of the old
Philosophers passed away the greatest Parts of their Lives among their
Gardens. <i>Epicurus</i> himself could not think sensual Pleasure attainable
in any other Scene. Every Reader who is acquainted with <i>Homer,
Virgil</i> and <i>Horace</i>, the greatest Genius's of all Antiquity, knows
very well with how much Rapture they have spoken on this Subject; and
that <i>Virgil</i> in particular has written a whole Book on the Art of
Planting.<br>
<br>
This Art seems to have been more especially adapted to the Nature of Man
in his Primaeval State, when he had Life enough to see his Productions
flourish in their utmost Beauty, and gradually decay with him. One who
lived before the Flood might have seen a Wood of the tallest Oakes in
the Accorn. But I only mention this Particular, in order to introduce in
my next Paper, a History which I have found among the Accounts of
<i>China</i>, and which may be looked upon as an Antediluvian Novel.<br>

<br>

<i>Hilpa</i> was one of the 150 Daughters of <i>Zilpah</i>, of the Race of <i>Cohu</i>,
by whom some of the Learned think is meant <i>Cain</i>. She was exceedingly
beautiful, and when she was but a Girl of threescore and ten Years of
Age, received the Addresses of several who made Love to her. Among these
were two Brothers, <i>Harpath</i> and <i>Shalum</i>; <i>Harpath</i>, being the
First-born, was Master of that fruitful Region which lies at the Foot of
Mount <i>Tirzah</i>, in the Southern Parts of <i>China</i>. <i>Shalum</i> (which is to
say the Planter in the <i>Chinese</i> Language) possessed all the
neighbouring Hills, and that great Range of Mountains which goes under
the Name of <i>Tirzah</i>. <i>Harpath</i> was of a haughty contemptuous Spirit;
<i>Shalum</i> was of a gentle Disposition, beloved both by God and Man.<br>
<br>
It is said that, among the Antediluvian Women, the Daughters of <i>Cohu</i>
had their Minds wholly set upon Riches; for which Reason the beautiful
<i>Hilpa</i> preferr'd <i>Harpath</i> to <i>Shalum</i>, because of his numerous Flocks
and Herds, that covered all the low Country which runs along the Foot of
Mount <i>Tirzah</i>, and is watered by several Fountains and Streams breaking
out of the Sides of that Mountain.<br>
<br>
<i>Harpath</i> made so quick a Dispatch of his Courtship, that he married
<i>Hilpa</i> in the hundredth Year of her Age; and being of an insolent
Temper, laughed to Scorn his Brother <i>Shalum</i> for having pretended to
the beautiful <i>Hilpa</i>, when he was Master of nothing but a long Chain of
Rocks and Mountains. This so much provoked <i>Shalum</i>, that he is said to
have cursed his Brother in the Bitterness of his Heart, and to have
prayed that one of his Mountains might fall upon his Head if ever he
came within the Shadow of it.<br>
<br>
From this Time forward <i>Harpath</i> would never venture out of the Vallies,
but came to an untimely End in the 250th Year of his Age, being drowned
in a River as he attempted to cross it This River is called to this Day,
from his Name who perished in it, the River <i>Harpath</i>, and, what is very
remarkable, issues out of one of those Mountains which <i>Shalum</i> wished
might fall upon his Brother, when he cursed him in the Bitterness of his
Heart.<br>
<br>
<i>Hilpa</i> was in the 160th Year of her Age at the Death of her Husband,
having brought him but 50 Children, before he was snatched away, as has
been already related. Many of the Antediluvians made Love to the young
Widow, tho' no one was thought so likely to succeed in her Affections as
her first Lover <i>Shalum</i>, who renewed his Court to her about ten Years
after the Death of <i>Harpath</i>; for it was not thought decent in those
Days that a Widow should be seen by a Man within ten Years after the
Decease of her Husband.<br>
<br>
<i>Shalum</i> falling into a deep Melancholy, and resolving to take away that
Objection which had been raised against him when he made his first
Addresses to <i>Hilpa</i>, began immediately, after her Marriage with
<i>Harpath</i>, to plant all that mountainous Region which fell to his Lot in
the Division of this Country. He knew how to adapt every Plant to its
proper Soil, and is thought to have inherited many traditional Secrets
of that Art from the first Man. This Employment turn'd at length to his
Profit as well as to his Amusement: His Mountains were in a few Years
shaded with young Trees, that gradually shot up into Groves, Woods, and
Forests, intermixed with Walks, and Launs, and Gardens; insomuch that
the whole Region, from a naked and desolate Prospect, began now to look
like a second Paradise. The Pleasantness of the Place, and the agreeable
Disposition of <i>Shalum</i>, who was reckoned one of the mildest and wisest
of all who lived before the Flood, drew into it Multitudes of People,
who were perpetually employed in the sinking of Wells, the digging of
Trenches, and the hollowing of Trees, for the better Distribution of
Water through every Part of this spacious Plantation.<br>
<br>
The Habitations of <i>Shalum</i> looked every Year more beautiful in the Eyes
of <i>Hilpa</i>, who, after the Space of 70 Autumns, was wonderfully pleased
with the distant Prospect of <i>Shalum</i>'s Hills, which were then covered
with innumerable Tufts of Trees and gloomy Scenes that gave a
Magnificence to the Place, and converted it into one of the finest
Landskips the Eye of Man could behold.<br>
<br>
The <i>Chinese</i> record a Letter which <i>Shalum</i> is said to have written to
<i>Hilpa</i>, in the Eleventh Year of her Widowhood. I shall here translate
it, without departing from that noble Simplicity of Sentiments, and
Plainness of Manners which appears in the Original.<br>
<br>
<i>Shalum</i> was at this Time 180 Years old, and <i>Hilpa</i> 170.

<blockquote>  Shalum, <i>Master of Mount</i> Tirzah, <i>to</i> Hilpa, <i>Mistress of the
  Vallies</i>.<br>
<br>
  <i>In the 788th Year of the Creation.</i><br>
<br>
  'What have I not suffered, O thou Daughter of <i>Zilpah</i>, since thou
  gavest thy self away in Marriage to my Rival? I grew weary of the
  Light of the Sun, and have been ever since covering my self with Woods
  and Forests. These threescore and ten Years have I bewailed the Loss
  of thee on the Tops of Mount <i>Tirzah</i>, and soothed my Melancholy among
  a thousand gloomy Shades of my own raising. My Dwellings are at
  present as the Garden of God; every Part of them is filled with
  Fruits, and Flowers, and Fountains. The whole Mountain is perfumed for
  thy Reception. Come up into it, O my Beloved, and let us People this
  Spot of the new World with a beautiful Race of Mortals; let us
  multiply exceedingly among these delightful Shades, and fill every
  Quarter of them with Sons and Daughters. Remember, O thou Daughter of
  <i>Zilpah,</i> that the Age of Man is but a thousand Years; that Beauty is
  the Admiration but of a few Centuries. It flourishes as a Mountain
  Oak, or as a Cedar on the Top of <i>Tirzah</i>, which in three or four
  hundred Years will fade away, and never be thought of by Posterity,
  unless a young Wood springs from its Roots. Think well on this, and
  remember thy Neighbour in the Mountains.</blockquote>


Having here inserted this Letter, which I look upon as the only
Antediluvian <i>Billet-doux</i> now extant, I shall in my next Paper give the
Answer to it, and the Sequel of this Story.<br>

<i>The Sequel of the Story of</i> Shalum <i>and</i> Hilpa.<br>
<br>
The Letter inserted in my last had so good an Effect upon <i>Hilpa,</i> that
she answered it in less than a Twelvemonth, after the following Manner.

<blockquote>  Hilpa, <i>Mistress of the Vallies, to</i> Shalum, <i>Master of Mount</i> Tirzah.<br>
<br>
  <i>In the 789th Year of the Creation.</i><br>
<br>
  'What have I to do with thee, O <i>Shalum?</i> Thou praisest <i>Hilpa</i>'s
  Beauty, but art thou not secretly enamoured with the Verdure of her
  Meadows? Art thou not more affected with the Prospect of her green
  Vallies, than thou wouldest be with the Sight of her Person? The
  Lowings of my Herds, and the Bleatings of my Flocks, make a pleasant
  Eccho in thy Mountains, and sound sweetly in thy Ears. What tho' I am
  delighted with the Wavings of thy Forests, and those Breezes of
  Perfumes which flow from the Top of <i>Tirzah:</i> Are these like the
  Riches of the Valley?<br>
<br>
  'I know thee, O <i>Shalum;</i> thou art more wise and happy than any of the
  Sons of Men. Thy Dwellings are among the Cedars; thou searchest out
  the Diversity of Soils, thou understandest the Influences of the
  Stars, and markest the Change of Seasons. Can a Woman appear lovely in
  the Eyes of such a one? Disquiet me not, O <i>Shalum;</i> let me alone,
  that I may enjoy those goodly Possessions which are fallen to my Lot.
  Win me not by thy enticing Words. May thy Trees increase and multiply;
  mayest thou add Wood to Wood, and Shade to Shade; but tempt not
  <i>Hilpa</i> to destroy thy Solitude, and make thy Retirement populous.</blockquote>

The <i>Chinese</i> say, that a little time afterwards she accepted of a Treat
in one of the neighbouring Hills to which <i>Shalum</i> had invited her. This
Treat lasted for two Years, and is said to have cost <i>Shalum</i> five
hundred Antelopes, two thousand Ostriches, and a thousand Tun of Milk;
but what most of all recommended it, was that Variety of delicious
Fruits and Pot-herbs, in which no Person then living could any way equal
<i>Shalum</i>.<br>
<br>
He treated her in the Bower which he had planted amidst the Wood of
Nightingales. This Wood was made up of such Fruit-Trees and Plants as
are most agreeable to the several Kinds of Singing Birds; so that it had
drawn into it all the Musick of the Country, and was filled from one End
of the Year to the other with the most agreeable Consort in Season.<br>
<br>
He shewed her every Day some beautiful and surprising Scene in this new
Region of Woodlands; and as by this Means he had all the Opportunities
he could wish for of opening his Mind to her, he succeeded so well, that
upon her Departure she made him a kind of Promise, and gave him her Word
to return him a positive Answer in less than fifty Years.<br>
<br>
She had not been long among her own People in the Vallies, when she
received new Overtures, and at the same Time a most splendid Visit from
<i>Mishpach</i>, who was a mighty Man of old, and had built a great City,
which he called after his own Name. Every House was made for at least a
thousand Years, nay there were some that were leased out for three
Lives; so that the Quantity of Stone and Timber consumed in this
Building is scarce to be imagined by those who live in the present Age
of the World. This great Man entertained her with the Voice of musical
Instruments which had been lately invented, and danced before her to the
Sound of the Timbrel. He also presented her with several domestick
Utensils wrought in Brass and Iron, which had been newly found out for
the Conveniency of Life. In the mean time <i>Shalum</i> grew very uneasie
with himself, and was sorely displeased at <i>Hilpa</i> for the Reception
which she had given to <i>Mishpach</i>, insomuch that he never wrote to her
or spoke of her during a whole Revolution of <i>Saturn</i>; but finding that
this Intercourse went no further than a Visit, he again renewed his
Addresses to her, who during his long Silence is said very often to have
cast a wishing Eye upon Mount <i>Tirzah</i>.<br>
<br>
Her Mind continued wavering about twenty Years longer between <i>Shalum</i>
and <i>Mishpach</i>; for tho' her Inclinations favoured the former, her
Interest pleaded very powerfully for the other. While her Heart was in
this unsettled Condition, the following Accident happened which
determined her Choice. A high Tower of Wood that stood in the City of
<i>Mishpach</i> having caught Fire by a Flash of Lightning, in a few Days
reduced the whole Town to Ashes. <i>Mishpach</i> resolved to rebuild the
Place whatever it should cost him; and having already destroyed all the
Timber of the Country, he was forced to have Recourse to <i>Shalum</i>, whose
Forests were now two hundred Years old. He purchased these Woods with so
many Herds of Cattle and Flocks of Sheep, and with such a vast Extent of
Fields and Pastures, that <i>Shalum</i> was now grown more wealthy than
<i>Mishpach</i>; and therefore appeared so charming in the Eyes of <i>Zilpah's</i>
Daughter, that she no longer refused him in Marriage. On the Day in
which he brought her up into the Mountains he raised a most prodigious
Pile of Cedar and of every sweet smelling Wood, which reached above 300
Cubits in Height; He also cast into the Pile Bundles of Myrrh and
Sheaves of Spikenard, enriching it with every spicy Shrub, and making it
fat with the Gums of his Plantations. This was the Burnt-Offering which
<i>Shalum</i> offered in the Day of his Espousals: The Smoke of it ascended
up to Heaven, and filled the whole Country with Incense and Perfume.<br>

<br>

By the last Post I received the following Letter, which is built upon a
Thought that is new, and very well carried on; for which Reasons I shall
give it to the Publick without Alteration, Addition, or Amendment.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <i><b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  'It was a good Piece of Advice which <i>Pythagoras</i> gave to his
  Scholars, That every Night before they slept they should examine what
  they had been a doing that Day, and so discover what Actions were
  worthy of Pursuit to-morrow, and what little Vices were to be
  prevented from slipping unawares into a Habit. If I might second the
  Philosopher's Advice, it should be mine, That in a Morning before my
  Scholar rose, he should consider what he had been about that Night,
  and with the same Strictness, as if the Condition he has believed
  himself to be in, was real. Such a Scrutiny into the Actions of his
  Fancy must be of considerable Advantage, for this Reason, because the
  Circumstances which a Man imagines himself in during Sleep, are
  generally such as entirely favour his Inclinations good or bad, and
  give him imaginary Opportunities of pursuing them to the utmost; so
  that his Temper will lye fairly open to his View, while he considers
  how it is moved when free from those Constraints which the Accidents
  of real Life put it under. Dreams are certainly the Result of our
  waking Thoughts, and our daily Hopes and Fears are what give the Mind
  such nimble Relishes of Pleasure, and such severe Touches of Pain, in
  its Midnight Rambles. A Man that murders his Enemy, or deserts his
  Friend in a Dream, had need to guard his Temper against Revenge and
  Ingratitude, and take heed that he be not tempted to do a vile thing
  in the Pursuit of false, or the Neglect of true Honour. For my Part, I
  seldom receive a Benefit, but in a Night or two's Time I make most
  noble Returns for it; which tho' my Benefactor is not a whit the
  better for, yet it pleases me to think that it was from a Principle of
  Gratitude in me, that my Mind was susceptible of such generous
  Transport while I thought my self repaying the Kindness of my Friend:
  And I have often been ready to beg Pardon, instead of returning an
  Injury, after considering, that when the Offender was in my Power I
  had carried my Resentments much too far.<br>
<br>
  'I think it has been observed in the Course of your Papers, how much
  one's Happiness or Misery may depend upon the Imagination: Of which
  Truth those strange Workings of Fancy in Sleep are no inconsiderable
  Instances; so that not only the Advantage a Man has of making
  Discoveries of himself, but a Regard to his own Ease or Disquiet, may
  induce him to accept of my Advice. Such as are willing to comply with
  it, I shall put into a way of doing it with pleasure, by observing
  only one Maxim which I shall give them, <i>viz. To go to Bed with a Mind
  entirely free from Passion, and a Body clear of the least
  Intemperance.</i><br>
<br>
  'They indeed who can sink into Sleep with their Thoughts less calm or
  innocent than they should be, do but plunge themselves into Scenes of
  Guilt and Misery; or they who are willing to purchase any Midnight
  Disquietudes for the Satisfaction of a full Meal, or a Skin full of
  Wine; these I have nothing to say to, as not knowing how to invite
  them to Reflections full of Shame and Horror: But those that will
  observe this Rule, I promise them they shall awake into Health and
  Cheerfulness, and be capable of recounting with Delight those glorious
  Moments wherein the Mind has been indulging it self in such Luxury of
  Thought, such noble Hurry of Imagination. Suppose a Man's going
  supperless to Bed should introduce him to the Table of some great
  Prince or other, where he shall be entertained with the noblest Marks
  of Honour and Plenty, and do so much Business after, that he shall
  rise with as good a Stomach to his Breakfast as if he had fasted all
  Night long; or suppose he should see his dearest Friends remain all
  Night in great Distresses, which he could instantly have disengaged
  them from, could he have been content to have gone to Bed without
  t'other Bottle: Believe me, these Effects of Fancy are no contemptible
  Consequences of commanding or indulging one's Appetite.<br>
<br>
  'I forbear recommending my Advice upon many other Accounts, till I
  hear how you and your Readers relish what I have already said, among
  whom if there be any that may pretend it is useless to them, because
  they never dream at all, there may be others, perhaps, who do little
  else all Day long. Were every one as sensible as I am what happens to
  him in his Sleep, it would be no Dispute whether we past so
  considerable a Portion of our Time in the Condition of Stocks and

Tho' the Author of the following Vision is unknown to me, I am apt to
think it may be the Work of that ingenious Gentleman, who promised me,
in the last Paper, some Extracts out of his Noctuary.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <i><b>Sir</b> </i><br>
<br>
  'I was the other Day reading the Life of <i>Mahomet.</i> Among many other
  Extravagancies, I find it recorded of that Impostor, that in the
  fourth Year of his Age the Angel <i>Gabriel</i> caught him up, while he was
  among his Play-fellows, and, carrying him aside, cut open his Breast,
  plucked out his Heart, and wrung out of it that black Drop of Blood,
  in which, say the <i>Turkish</i> Divines, is contained the <i>Fomes Peccati</i>,
  so that he was free from Sin ever after. I immediately said to my
  self, tho' this Story be a Fiction, a very good Moral may be drawn
  from it, would every Man but apply it to himself, and endeavour to
  squeeze out of his Heart whatever Sins or ill Qualities he finds in
  it.<br>
<br>
  'While my Mind was wholly taken up with this Contemplation, I
  insensibly fell into a most pleasing Slumber, when methought two
  Porters entered my Chamber, carrying a large Chest between them. After
  having set it down in the middle of the Room they departed. I
  immediately endeavour'd to open what was sent me, when a Shape, like
  that in which we paint our Angels, appeared before me, and forbad me.
  Enclosed, said he, are the Hearts of several of your Friends and
  Acquaintance; but before you can be qualified to see and animadvert on
  the Failings of others, you must be pure your self; whereupon he drew
  out his Incision Knife, cut me open, took out my Heart, and began to
  squeeze it. I was in a great Confusion, to see how many things, which
  I had always cherished as Virtues, issued out of my Heart on this
  Occasion. In short, after it had been thoroughly squeezed, it looked
  like an empty Bladder, when the Phantome, breathing a fresh Particle
  of Divine Air into it, restored it safe to its former Repository: and
  having sewed me up, we began to examine the Chest.<br>
<br>
  'The Hearts were all enclosed in transparent Phials, and preserved in
  a Liquor which looked like Spirits of Wine. The first which I cast my
  Eye upon, I was afraid would have broke the Glass which contained it.
  It shot up and down, with incredible Swiftness, thro' the Liquor in
  which it swam, and very frequently bounced against the Side of the
  Phial. The <i>Fomes</i>, or Spot in the Middle of it, was not large, but of
  a red fiery Colour, and seemed to be the Cause of these violent
  Agitations. That, says my Instructor, is the Heart of <i>Tom.
  Dread-Nought,</i> who behaved himself well in the late Wars, but has for
  these Ten Years last past been aiming at some Post of Honour to no
  Purpose. He is lately retired into the Country, where, quite choaked
  up with Spleen and Choler, he rails at better Men than himself, and
  will be for ever uneasie, because it is impossible he should think his
  Merit sufficiently rewarded. The next Heart that I examined was
  remarkable for its Smallness; it lay still at the Bottom of the Phial,
  and I could hardly perceive that it beat at all. The <i>Fomes</i> was quite
  black, and had almost diffused it self over the whole Heart. This,
  says my Interpreter, is the Heart of <i>Dick Gloomy</i>, who never thirsted
  after any thing but Money. Notwithstanding all his Endeavours, he is
  still poor. This has flung him into a most deplorable State of
  Melancholy and Despair. He is a Composition of Envy and Idleness,
  hates Mankind, but gives them their Revenge by being more uneasie to
  himself, than to any one else.<br>
<br>
  'The Phial I looked upon next contained a large fair Heart, which beat
  very strongly. The <i>Fomes</i> or Spot in it was exceeding small; but I
  could not help observing, that which way soever I turned the Phial it
  always appeared uppermost and in the strongest Point of Light. The
  Heart you are examining, says my Companion, belongs to <i>Will. Worthy</i>.
  He has, indeed, a most noble Soul, and is possessed of a thousand good
  Qualities. The Speck which you discover is <i>Vanity.</i><br>
<br>
  'Here, says the Angel, is the Heart of <i>Freelove</i>, your intimate
  Friend. <i>Freelove</i> and I, said I, are at present very cold to one
  another, and I do not care for looking on the Heart of a Man, which I
  fear is overcast with Rancour. My Teacher commanded me to look upon
  it; I did so, and to my unspeakable Surprize, found that a small
  swelling Spot, which I at first took to be <i>Ill-Will</i> towards me, was
  only <i>Passion</i>, and that upon my nearer Inspection it wholly
  disappeared; upon which the Phantome told me <i>Freelove</i> was one of the
  best-natured Men alive.<br>
<br>
  'This, says my Teacher, is a Female Heart of your Acquaintance. I
  found the <i>Fomes</i> in it of the largest Size, and of a hundred
  different Colours, which were still varying every Moment. Upon my
  asking to whom it belonged, I was informed that it was the Heart of
  <i>Coquetilla.</i><br>
<br>
  'I set it down, and drew out another, in which I took the <i>Fomes</i> at
  first Sight to be very small, but was amazed to find, that as I looked
  stedfastly upon it, it grew still larger. It was the Heart of
  <i>Melissa</i>, a noted Prude who lives the next Door to me.<br>
<br>
  'I show you this, says the Phantome, because it is indeed a Rarity,
  and you have the Happiness to know the Person to whom it belongs. He
  then put into my Hands a large Chrystal Glass, that enclosed an Heart,
  in which, though I examined it with the utmost Nicety, I could not
  perceive any Blemish. I made no Scruple to affirm that it must be the
  Heart of <i>Seraphina</i>, and was glad, but not surprized, to find that it
  was so. She is, indeed, continued my Guide, the Ornament, as well as
  the Envy, of her Sex; at these last Words, he pointed to the Hearts of
  several of her Female Acquaintance which lay in different Phials, and
  had very large Spots in them, all of a deep <i>Blue.</i> You are not to
  wonder, says he, that you see no Spot in an Heart, whose Innocence has
  been Proof against all the Corruptions of a depraved Age. If it has
  any Blemish, it is too small to be discovered by Human Eyes.<br>
<br>
  'I laid it down, and took up the Hearts of other Females, in all of
  which the <i>Fomes</i> ran in several Veins, which were twisted together,
  and made a very perplexed Figure. I asked the Meaning of it, and was
  told it represented <i>Deceit.</i><br>
<br>
  'I should have been glad to have examined the Hearts of several of my
  Acquaintance, whom I knew to be particularly addicted to Drinking,
  Gaming, Intreaguing, &amp;c., but my Interpreter told me I must let that
  alone till another Opportunity, and flung down the Cover of the Chest
  with so much violence, as immediately awoke me.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote><i>Dicitis, omnis in Imbecillitate est et Gratia, et Caritas.</i><br>
<br>
Cicero  <i>de Nat. Deor. L.</i><a href="transindex.html#588t"><img src="images/qmark.png" width="15" height="15" align="right" alt="translation"></a></blockquote><br>
<br>

Man may be considered in two Views, as a Reasonable, and as a Sociable
Being; capable of becoming himself either happy or miserable, and of
contributing to the Happiness or Misery of his Fellow Creatures.
Suitably to this double Capacity, the Contriver of Human Nature hath
wisely furnished it with two Principles of Action, Self-love and
Benevolence; designed one of them to render Man wakeful to his own
personal Interest, the other to dispose him for giving his utmost
Assistance to all engaged in the same Pursuit. This is such an Account
of our Frame, so agreeable to Reason, so much for the Honour of our
Maker, and the Credit of our Species, that it may appear somewhat
unaccountable what should induce Men to represent human Nature as they
do under Characters of Disadvantage, or, having drawn it with a little
and sordid Aspect, what Pleasure they can possibly take in such a
Picture. Do they reflect that 'tis their Own, and, if we will believe
themselves, is not more odious than the Original?<br>
<br>
One of the first that talked in this lofty Strain of our Nature was
  <i>Beneficence</i>, would his Followers say, is all founded in
Weakness; and, whatever be pretended, the Kindness that passeth between
Men and Men is by every Man directed to himself. This, it must be
confessed, is of a Piece with the rest of that hopeful Philosophy, which
having patch'd Man up out of the four Elements, attributes his Being to
Chance, and derives all his Actions from an unintelligible Declination
of Atoms. And for these glorious Discoveries the Poet is beyond Measure
transported in the Praises of his Hero, as if he must needs be something
more than Man, only for an Endeavour to prove that Man is in nothing
superior to Beasts.<br>
<br>
In this School was Mr. <i>Hobs</i> instructed to speak after the same Manner,
if he did not rather draw his Knowledge from an Observation of his own
Temper; for he somewhere unluckily lays down this as a Rule,

<blockquote><i>  'That from the Similitudes of Thoughts and Passions of one Man to the
  Thoughts and Passions of another, whosoever looks into himself and
  considers what he doth when he thinks, hopes, fears, &amp;c., and upon
  what Grounds; he shall hereby read and know what are the Thoughts and
  Passions of all other Men upon the like Occasions.'</i></blockquote>

Now we will allow Mr. <i>Hobs</i> to know best how he was inclined; But in
earnest, I should be heartily out of Conceit with my self, if I thought
my self of this unamiable Temper, as he affirms, and should have as
little Kindness for my self as for any Body in the World. Hitherto I
always imagined that kind and benevolent Propensions were the original
Growth of the Heart of Man, and, however checked and over-topped by
counter Inclinations that have since sprung up within us, have still
some Force in the worst of Tempers, and a considerable Influence on the
best. And, methinks, it's a fair Step towards the Proof of this, that
the most beneficent of all Beings is He who hath an absolute Fulness of
Perfection in Himself, who gave Existence to the Universe, and so cannot
be supposed to want that which He communicated, without diminishing from
the Plenitude of his own Power and Happiness. The Philosophers before
mentioned have indeed done all that in them lay to invalidate this
Argument; for, placing the Gods in a State of the most elevated
Blessedness, they describe them as Selfish as we poor miserable Mortals
can be, and shut them out from all Concern for Mankind, upon the Score
of their having no Need of us.<br>
<br>
But if He that sitteth in the Heavens wants not us, we stand in
continual Need of Him; and surely, next to the Survey of the immense
Treasures of his own Mind, the most exalted Pleasure He receives is from
beholding Millions of Creatures, lately drawn out of the Gulph of
Non-existence, rejoycing in the various Degrees of Being and Happiness
imparted to them. And as this is the true, the glorious Character of the
Deity, so in forming a reasonable Creature He would not, if possible,
suffer his Image to pass out of his Hands unadorned with a Resemblance
of Himself in this most lovely Part of his Nature. For what Complacency
could a Mind, whose Love is as unbounded as his Knowledge, have in a
Work so unlike Himself? a Creature that should be capable of knowing and
conversing with a vast Circle of Objects, and love none but Himself?
What Proportion would there be between the Head and the Heart of such a
Creature, its Affections, and its Understandings? Or could a Society of
such Creatures, with no other Bottom but Self-Love on which to maintain
a Commerce, ever flourish? Reason, 'tis certain, would oblige every Man
to pursue the general Happiness, as the Means to procure and establish
his own; and yet if, besides this Consideration, there were not a
natural Instinct, prompting Men to de<b>Sir</b> e the Welfare and Satisfaction
of others, Self-Love, in Defiance of the Admonitions of Reason, would
quickly run all Things into a State of War and Confusion.<br>
<br>
As nearly interested as the Soul is in the Fate of the Body; our
provident Creator saw it necessary, by the constant Returns of Hunger
and Thirst, those importunate Appetites, to put it in Mind of its
Charge; knowing, that if we should eat and drink no oftner than cold
abstracted Speculation should put us upon these Exercises, and then
leave it to Reason to prescribe the Quantity, we should soon refine our
selves out of this bodily Life. And indeed, 'tis obvious to remark, that
we follow nothing heartily, unless carried to it by Inclinations which
anticipate our Reason, and, like a Biass, draw the Mind strongly towards
it. In order, therefore, to establish a perpetual Intercourse of
Benefits amongst Mankind, their Maker would not fail to give them this
generous Prepossession of Benevolence, if, as I have said, it were
possible. And from whence can we go about to argue its Impossibility? Is
it inconsistent with Self-Love? Are their Motions contrary? No more than
the diurnal Rotation of the Earth is opposed to its Annual; or its
Motion round its own Center, which may be improved as an Illustration of
Self-Love, to that which whirls it about the common Center of the World,
answering to universal Benevolence. Is the Force of Self-Love abated, or
its Interest prejudiced by Benevolence? So far from it, that
Benevolence, though a distinct Principle, is extreamly serviceable to
Self-Love, and then doth most Service when 'tis least designed.<br>
<br>
But to descend from Reason to Matter of Fact; the Pity which arises on
Sight of Persons in Distress, and the Satisfaction of Mind which is the
Consequence of having removed them into a happier State, are instead of
a thousand Arguments to prove such a thing as a disinterested
Benevolence. Did Pity proceed from a Reflection we make upon our
Liableness to the same ill Accidents we see befall others, it were
nothing to the present Purpose; but this is assigning an artificial
Cause of a natural Passion, and can by no Means be admitted as a
tolerable Account of it, because Children and Persons most Thoughtless
about their own Condition, and incapable of entering into the Prospects
of Futurity, feel the most violent Touches of Compassion.<br>
<br>
And then as to that charming Delight which immediately follows the
giving Joy to another, or relieving his Sorrow, and is, when the Objects
are numerous, and the kindness of Importance really inexpressible, what
can this be owing to but a Consciousness of a Man's having done some
thing Praise-worthy, and expressive of a great Soul? Whereas, if in all
this he only Sacrificed to Vanity and Self-Love, as there would be
nothing brave in Actions that make the most shining Appearance, so
Nature would not have rewarded them with this divine Pleasure; nor could
the Commendations, which a Person receives for Benefits done upon
selfish Views, be at all more Satisfactory, than when he is applauded
for what he doth without Design; because in both Cases the Ends of
Self-Love are equally answered.<br>
<br>
The Conscience of approving ones self a Benefactor to Mankind is the
noblest Recompence for being so; doubtless it is, and the most
interested cannot propose anything so much to their own Advantage,
notwithstanding which, the Inclination is nevertheless unselfish. The
Pleasure which attends the Gratification of our Hunger and Thirst, is
not the Cause of these Appetites; they are previous to any such
Prospect; and so likewise is the De<b>Sir</b> e of doing Good; with this
Difference, that being seated in the intellectual Part, this last,
though Antecedent to Reason, may yet be improved and regulated by it,
and, I will add, is no otherwise a Virtue than as it is so.<br>
<br>
Thus have I contended for the Dignity of that Nature I have the Honour
to partake of, and, after all the Evidence produced, think I have a
Right to conclude, against the Motto of this Paper, that there is such a
thing as Generosity in the World. Though if I were under a Mistake in
this, I should say as <i>Cicero</i> in Relation to the Immortality of the
Soul, I willingly err, and should believe it very much for the Interest
of Mankind to lye under the same Delusion. For the contrary Notion
naturally tends to dispirit the Mind, and sinks it into a Meanness fatal
to the Godlike Zeal of doing good. As on the other hand, it teaches
People to be Ungrateful, by possessing them with a Perswasion concerning
their Benefactors, that they have no Regard to them in the Benefits they
bestow. Now he that banishes Gratitude from among Men, by so doing stops
up the Stream of Beneficence. For though in conferring Kindnesses, a
truly generous Man doth not aim at a Return, yet he looks to the
Qualities of the Person obliged, and as nothing renders a Person more
unworthy of a Benefit, than his being without all Resentment of it, he
will not be extreamly forward to Oblige such a Man.<br>

<br>
  'I am so great an Admirer of Trees, that the Spot of Ground I have
  chosen to build a small Seat upon, in the Country, is almost in the
  midst of a large Wood. I was obliged, much against my Will, to cut
  down several Trees, that I might have any such thing as a Walk in my
  Gardens; but then I have taken Care to leave the Space, between every
  Walk, as much a Wood as I found it. The Moment you turn either to the
  Right or Left, you are in a Forest, where Nature presents you with a
  much more beautiful Scene than could have been raised by Art.<br>
<br>
  'Instead of <i>Tulips</i> or <i>Carnations</i>, I can shew you <i>Oakes</i> in my
  Gardens of four hundred Years standing, and a Knot of <i>Elms</i> that
  might shelter a Troop of Horse from the Rain.<br>
<br>
  'It is not without the utmost Indignation, that I observe several
  prodigal young Heirs in the Neighbourhood, felling down the most
  glorious Monuments of their Ancestors Industry, and ruining, in a Day,
  the Product of Ages.<br>
<br>
  'I am mightily pleased with your Discourse upon Planting, which put me
  upon looking into my Books to give you some Account of the Veneration
  the Ancients had for Trees. There is an old Tradition, that <i>Abraham</i>
  planted a <i>Cypress</i>, a <i>Pine</i>, and a <i>Cedar</i>, and that these three
  incorporated into one Tree, which was cut down for the building of the
  Temple of <i>Solomon.</i><br>
<br>
  '<i>Isidorus</i>, who lived in the Reign of <i>Constantius</i>, assures us, that
  he saw, even in his Time, that famous <i>Oak</i> in the Plains of <i>Mambr&eacute;</i>,
  under which <i>Abraham</i> is reported to have dwelt, and adds, that the
  People looked upon it with a great Veneration, and preserved it as a
  Sacred Tree.<br>
<br>
  'The Heathens still went farther, and regarded it as the highest Piece
  of Sacrilege to injure certain Trees which they took to be protected
  by some Deity. The Story of <i>Erisicthon</i>, the Grove of <i>Dodona</i>, and
  that at <i>Delphi</i>, are all Instances of this Kind.<br>
<br>
  'If we consider the Machine in <i>Virgil</i>, so much blamed by several
  Criticks, in this Light, we shall hardly think it too violent.<br>
<br>
  '<i>&AElig;neas</i>, when he built his Fleet, in order to sail for <i>Italy</i>, was
  obliged to cut down the Grove on Mount <i>Ida</i>, which however he durst
  not do till he had obtained leave from <i>Cybele</i>, to whom it was
  dedicated. The Goddess could not but think her self obliged to protect
  these Ships, which were made of Consecrated Timber, after a very
  extraordinary Manner, and therefore de<b>Sir</b> ed <i>Jupiter</i>, that they might
  not be obnoxious to the Power of Waves or Winds. <i>Jupiter</i> would not
  grant this, but promised her, that as many as came safe to <i>Italy</i>
  should be transformed into Goddesses of the Sea; which the Poet tells
  us was accordingly executed.

<blockquote><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now at length the number'd Hours were come,<br>
Prefix'd by Fate's irrevocable Doom,<br>
When the great Mother of the Gods was free<br>
To save her Ships, and finish</i> Jove's <i>Decree.<br>
First, from the Quarter of the Morn, there sprung<br>
A Light that sign'd the Heavens, and shot along:<br>
Then from a Cloud, fring'd round with Golden Fires,<br>
Were Timbrels heard, and</i> Berecynthian <i>Quires:<br>
And last a Voice, with more than Mortal Sounds,<br>
Both Hosts in Arms oppos'd, with equal Horror wounds.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O</i> Trojan <i>Race, your needless Aid forbear;<br>
And know my Ships are my peculiar Care.<br>
With greater Ease the bold</i> Rutulian <i>may,<br>
With hissing Brands, attempt to burn the Sea,<br>
Than singe my sacred Pines. But you my Charge,<br>
Loos'd from your crooked Anchors launch at large,<br>
Exalted each a Nymph: Forsake the Sand,<br>
And swim the Seas, at</i> Cybele's <i>Command.<br>
No sooner had the Goddess ceas'd to speak,<br>
When lo, th' obedient Ships their Haulsers break;<br>
And, strange to tell, like Dolphins in the Main,<br>
They plunge their Prows, and dive, and spring again:<br>
As many beauteous Maids the Billows sweep,<br>
As rode before tall Vessels on the Deep.</i><br>
<br>
(Dryden's Virg.)</blockquote>

  'The common Opinion concerning the Nymphs, whom the Ancients called
  <i>Hamadryads</i>, is more to the Honour of Trees than any thing yet
  mentioned. It was thought the Fate of these Nymphs had so near a
  Dependance on some Trees, more especially Oaks, that they lived and
  died together. For this Reason they were extremely grateful to such
  Persons who preserved those Trees with which their Being subsisted.
  <i>Apollonius</i> tells us a very remarkable Story to this Purpose, with
  which I shall conclude my Letter.<br>
<br>
  'A certain Man, called <i>Rh&oelig;cus</i>, observing an old Oak ready to fall,
  and being moved with a sort of Compassion towards the Tree, ordered
  his Servants to pour in fresh Earth at the Roots of it, and set it
  upright. The <i>Hamadryad</i> or Nymph who must necessarily have perished
  with the Tree, appeared to him the next Day, and after having returned
  him her Thanks, told him, she was ready to grant whatever he should
  ask. As she was extreamly Beautiful, <i>Rh&oelig;cus</i> de<b>Sir</b> ed he might be
  entertained as her Lover. The <i>Hamadryad</i>, not much displeased with
  the Request, promis'd to give him a Meeting, but commanded him for
  some Days to abstain from the Embraces of all other Women, adding that
  she would send a Bee to him, to let him know when he was to be Happy.
  <i>Rh&oelig;cus</i> was, it seems, too much addicted to Gaming, and happened to
  be in a Run of ill Luck when the faithful Bee came buzzing about him;
  so that instead of minding his kind Invitation, he had like to have
  killed him for his Pains. The <i>Hamadryad</i> was so provoked at her own
  Disappointment, and the ill Usage of her Messenger, that she deprived
  <i>Rh&oelig;cus</i> of the Use of his Limbs. However, says the Story, he was not
  so much a Criple, but he made a shift to cut down the Tree, and
  consequently to fell his Mistress.</blockquote><br>

<i><a name="fr5901">The</a> following Discourse comes from the same Hand with the Essays upon
Infinitude.</i><a href="#f5901"><sup>1</sup></a><br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
We consider infinite Space as an Expansion without a Circumference: We
consider Eternity, or infinite Duration, as a Line that has neither a
Beginning nor an End. In our Speculations of infinite Space, we consider
that particular Place in which we exist, as a kind of Center to the
whole Expansion. In our Speculations of Eternity, we consider the Time
which is present to us as the Middle, which divides the whole Line into
two equal Parts. For this Reason, many witty Authors compare the present
Time to an Isthmus or narrow Neck of Land, that rises in the midst of an
Ocean, immeasurably diffused on either Side of it.<br>
<br>
Philosophy, and indeed common Sense, naturally throws Eternity under two
Divisions; which we may call in <i>English</i>, that Eternity which is past,
and that Eternity which is to come. The learned Terms of <i>&AElig;ternitas a
Parte ante</i>, and <i>&AElig;ternitas a Parte post</i>, may be more amusing to the
Reader, but can have no other Idea affixed to them than what is conveyed
to us by those Words, an Eternity that is past, and an Eternity that is
to come. Each of these Eternities is bounded at the one Extream; or, in
other Words, the former has an End, and the latter a Beginning.<br>
<br>
Let us first of all consider that Eternity which is past, reserving that
which is to come for the Subject of another Paper. The Nature of this
Eternity is utterly inconceivable by the Mind of Man: Our Reason
demonstrates to us that it <i>has been</i>, but at the same Time can frame no
Idea of it, but what is big with Absurdity and Contradiction. We can
have no other Conception of any Duration which is past, than that all of
it was once present; and whatever was once present, is at some certain
Distance from us, and whatever is at any certain Distance from us, be
the Distance never so remote, cannot be Eternity. The very Notion of any
Duration's being past, implies that it was once present; for the Idea of
being once present, is actually included in the Idea of its being past.
This therefore is a Depth not to be sounded by human Understanding. We
are sure that there has been an Eternity, and yet contradict our selves
when we measure this Eternity by any Notion which we can frame of it.<br>
<br>
If we go to the Bottom of this Matter, we shall find, that the
Difficulties we meet with in our Conceptions of Eternity proceed from
this single Reason, That we can have no other Idea of any kind of
Duration, than that by which we our selves, and all other created
Beings, do exist; which is, a successive Duration made up of past,
present, and to come. There is nothing which exists after this Manner,
all the Parts of whose Existence were not once actually present, and
consequently may be reached by a certain Number of Years applied to it.
We may ascend as high as we please, and employ our Being to that
Eternity which is to come, in adding Millions of Years to Millions of
Years, and we can never come up to any Fountain-Head of Duration, to any
Beginning in Eternity: But at the same time we are sure, that whatever
was once present does lye within the Reach of Numbers, though perhaps we
can never be able to put enough of them together for that Purpose. We
may as well say, that any thing may be actually present in any Part of
infinite Space, which does not lye at a certain Distance from us, as
that any Part of infinite Duration was once actually present, and does
not also lye at some determined Distance from us. The Distance in both
Cases may be immeasurable and indefinite as to our Faculties, but our
Reason tells us that it cannot be so in it self. Here therefore is that
Difficulty which Human Understanding is not capable of surmounting. We
are sure that something must have existed from Eternity, and are at the
same Time unable to conceive, that any thing which exists, according to
our Notion of Existence, can have existed from Eternity.<br>
<br>
It is hard for a Reader, who has not rolled this Thought in his own
Mind, to follow in such an abstracted Speculation; but I have been the
longer on it, because I think it is a demonstrative Argument of the
Being and Eternity of a God: And tho' there are many other
Demonstrations which lead us to this great Truth, I do not think we
ought to lay aside any Proofs in this Matter which the Light of Reason
has suggested to us, especially when it is such a one as has been urged
by Men famous for their Penetration and Force of Understanding, and
which appears altogether conclusive to those who will be at the Pains to
examine it.<br>
<br>
Having thus considered that Eternity which is past, according to the
best Idea we can frame of it, I shall now draw up those several Articles
on this Subject which are dictated to us by the Light of Reason, and
which may be looked upon as the Creed of a Philosopher in this great
Point.<br>
<br>
<i>First</i>, It is certain that no Being could have made it self; for if so,
it must have acted before it was, which is a Contradiction.<br>
<br>
<i>Secondly</i>, That therefore some Being must have existed from all
Eternity.<br>
<br>
<i>Thirdly</i>, That whatever exists after the manner of created Beings, or
according to any Notions which we have of Existence, could not have
existed from Eternity.<br>
<br>
<i>Fourthly</i>, That this eternal Being must therefore be the great Author
of Nature, <i>The Ancient of Days</i>, who, being at an infinite Distance in
his Perfections from all finite and created Beings, exists in a quite
different Manner from them, and in a Manner of which they can have no
Idea.<br>
<br>
I know that several of the School-men, who would not be thought ignorant
of any thing, have pretended to explain the Manner of God's Existence,
by telling us, That he comprehends infinite Duration in every Moment;
That Eternity is with him a <i>Punctum stans</i>, a fixed Point; or, which is
as good Sense, an <i>Infinite Instance;</i> That nothing with Reference to
his Existence is either past or to come: To which the ingenious Mr.
<i>Cowley</i> alludes in his Description of Heaven,

<blockquote><i>Nothing is there to come, and nothing past,<br>
But an Eternal <b>Now</b> does always last.</i></blockquote>

For my own Part, I look upon these Propositions as Words that have no
Ideas annexed to them; and think Men had better own their Ignorance than
advance Doctrines by which they mean nothing, and which indeed are
self-contradictory. We cannot be too modest in our Disquisitions, when
we meditate on Him who is environed with so much Glory and Perfection,
who is the Source of Being, the Fountain of all that Existence which we
and his whole Creation derive from him. Let us therefore with the utmost
Humility acknowledge, that as some Being must necessarily have existed
from Eternity, so this Being does exist after an incomprehensible
manner, since it is impossible for a Being to have existed from Eternity
after our Manner or Notions of Existence. Revelation confirms these
natural Dictates of Reason in the Accounts which it gives us of the
Divine Existence, where it tells us, that he is the same Yesterday,
To-day, and for Ever; that he is the <i>Alpha</i> and <i>Omega</i>, the Beginning
and the Ending; that a thousand Years are with him as one Day, and one
Day as a Thousand Years; by which and the like Expressions, we are
taught, that his Existence, with Relation to Time or Duration, is
infinitely different from the Existence of any of his Creatures, and
consequently that it is impossible for us to frame any adequate
Conceptions of it.<br>
<br>
In the first Revelation which he makes of his own Being, he entitles
himself,<i> I am that I am</i>; and when <i>Moses</i> de<b>Sir</b> es to know what Name he
shall give him in his Embassy to <i>Pharaoh</i>, he bids him say that <i>I am</i>
hath sent you. Our great Creator, by this Revelation of himself, does in
a manner exclude every thing else from a real Existence, and
distinguishes himself from his Creatures, as the only Being which truly
and really exists. The ancient Platonick Notion, which was drawn from
Speculations of Eternity, wonderfully agrees with this Revelation which
God has made of himself. There is nothing, say they, which in Reality
exists, whose Existence, as we call it, is pieced up of past, present,
and to come. Such a flitting and successive Existence is rather a Shadow
of Existence, and something which is like it, than Existence it self. He
only properly exists whose Existence is intirely present; that is, in
other Words, who exists in the most perfect Manner, and in such a Manner
as we have no Idea of.<br>
<br>
I shall conclude this Speculation with one useful Inference. How can we
sufficiently prostrate our selves and fall down before our Maker, when
we consider that ineffable Goodness and Wisdom which contrived this
Existence for finite Natures? What must be the Overflowings of that good
Will, which prompted our Creator to adapt Existence to Beings, in whom
it is not necessary? Especially when we consider that he himself was
before him in the compleat Possession of Existence and of Happiness, and
in the full Enjoyment of Eternity. What Man can think of himself as
called out and separated from nothing, of his being made a conscious, a
reasonable and a happy Creature, in short, of being taken in as a Sharer
of Existence, and a kind of Partner in Eternity, without being swallowed
up in Wonder, in Praise, in Adoration! It is indeed a Thought too big
for the Mind of Man, and rather to be entertained in the Secrecy of
Devotion, and in the Silence of the Soul, than to be expressed by Words.
The Supreme Being has not given us Powers or Faculties sufficient to
extol and magnifie such unutterable Goodness.<br>
<br>
It is however some Comfort to us, that we shall be always doing what we
shall be never able to do, and that a Work which cannot be finished,
will however be the Work of an Eternity.<br>

<br>

I have just receiv'd a Letter from a Gentleman, who tells me he has
observed, with <a name="fr5911">no</a> small Concern, that my Papers have of late been very
barren in relation to Love<a href="#f5911"><sup>1</sup></a>; a Subject which when agreeably handled,
can scarce fail of being well receiv'd by both Sexes.<br>
<br>
If my Invention therefore should be almost exhausted on this Head, he
offers to serve under me in the Quality of a <i>Love Casuist;</i> for which
Place he conceives himself to be throughly qualified, having made this
Passion his Principal Study, and observed it in all its different Shapes
and Appearances, from the Fifteenth to the Forty Fifth Year of his Age.<br>
<br>
He assures me with an Air of Confidence, which I hope proceeds from his
real Abilities, that he does not doubt of giving Judgment to the
Satisfaction of the Parties concerned, on the most nice and intricate
Cases which can happen in an Amour; as,
<ul><li>

How great the Contraction of the Fingers must be before it amounts to a
Squeeze by the Hand.</li></ul><ul><li>

What can be properly termed an absolute Denial from a Maid, and what
from a Widow.</li></ul><ul><li>

What Advances a Lover may presume to make, after having received a Patt
upon his Shoulder from his Mistress's Fan.</li></ul><ul><li>

Whether a Lady, at the first Interview, may allow an Humble Servant to
kiss her Hand.</li></ul><ul><li>

How far it may be permitted to caress the Maid in order to succeed with
the Mistress.</li></ul><ul><li>

What Constructions a Man may put upon a Smile, and in what Cases a Frown
goes for nothing.</li></ul><ul><li>

On what Occasions a sheepish Look may do Service, <i>&amp;c.</i></li></ul>

As a farther Proof of his Skill, he has also sent me several Maxims in
Love, which he assures me are the Result of a long and profound
Reflection, some of which I think my self obliged to communicate to the
Publick, not remembering to have seen them before in any Author.
<ul><li>
  'There are more Calamities in the World arising from Love than from
  Hatred.</li></ul><ul><li>

  Love is the Daughter of <i>Idleness</i>, but the Mother of <i>Disquietude.</i></li></ul><ul><li>

  Men of grave Natures (says <b>Sir</b>  <i>Francis Bacon</i>) are the most
  constant; for the same Reason Men should be more constant than Women.</li></ul><ul><li>

  The Gay Part of Mankind is most amorous, the Serious most loving.</li></ul><ul><li>

  A Coquet often loses her Reputation, whilst she preserves her Virtue.</li></ul><ul><li>

  A Prude often preserves her Reputation when she has lost her Virtue.</li></ul><ul><li>

  Love refines a Man's Behaviour, but makes a Woman's ridiculous.</li></ul><ul><li>

  Love is generally accompanied with Good-will in the Young, Interest
  in the Middle-aged, and a Passion too gross to Name in the Old.</li></ul><ul><li>

  The Endeavours to revive a decaying Passion generally extinguish the
  Remains of it.</li></ul><ul><li>

  A Woman who from being a Slattern becomes over-neat, or from being
  over-neat becomes a Slattern, is most certainly in Love.</li></ul>

I shall make use of this Gentleman's Skill as I see Occasion; and since
I am got upon the Subject of Love, shall conclude this Paper with a Copy
of Verses which were lately sent me by an unknown Hand, as I look upon
them to be above the ordinary Run of Sonneteers.<br>
<br>
<a name="fr5912">The</a> Author tells me they were written in one of his despairing Fits; and
I find entertains some Hope that his Mistress may pity such a Passion as
he has described, before she knows that she is herself <i>Corinna.</i>

<blockquote><i>Conceal, fond Man, conceal the mighty Smart,<br>
Nor tell</i> Corinna <i>she has fir'd thy Heart.<br>
In vain would'st thou complain, in vain pretend<br>
To ask a Pity which she must not lend.<br>
She's too much thy Superior to comply,<br>
And too too fair to let thy Passion dye.<br>
Languish in Secret, and with dumb Surprize<br>
Drink the resistless Glances of her Eyes.<br>
At awful Distance entertain thy Grief,<br>
Be still in Pain, but never ask Relief.<br>
Ne'er tempt her Scorn of thy consuming State;<br>
Be any way undone, but fly her Hate.<br>
Thou must submit to see thy Charmer bless<br>
Some happier Youth that shall admire her less;<br>
Who in that lovely Form, that Heavenly Mind,<br>
Shall miss ten thousand Beauties thou could'st find;<br>
Who with low Fancy shall approach her Charms,<br>
While half enjoy'd she sinks into his Arms.<br>
She knows not, must not know, thy nobler Fire,<br>
Whom she, and whom the Muses do inspire;<br>
Her Image only shall thy Breast employ,<br>
And fill thy captiv'd Soul with Shades of joy;<br>
Direct thy Dreams by Night, thy Thoughts by Day;<br>
And never, never, from thy Bosom stray<a href="#f5912"><sup>2</sup></a>.</i></blockquote><br>

<br>

I look upon the Play-house as a World within it self. They have lately
furnished the Middle Region of it with a new Sett of Meteors, in order
to give the Sublime to many modern Tragedies. I <a name="fr5921">was</a> there last Winter at
the first Rehearsal of the new Thunder<a href="#f5921"><sup>1</sup></a>, which is much more deep and
sonorous than any hitherto made use of. They have a <i>Salmoneus</i> behind
the Scenes, who plays it off with great Success. Their Lightnings are
made to flash more briskly than heretofore; their Clouds are also better
furbelow'd, and more voluminous; not to mention a violent Storm locked
up in a great Chest that is designed for the <i>Tempest.</i> They are also
provided with above a Dozen Showers of Snow, which, as I am informed,
are the Plays of many unsuccessful Poets artificially cut and shreaded
for that Use. Mr. <i>Rimer's Edgar</i> is to fall in Snow at the next acting
of King <i>Lear</i>, in order to heighten, or rather to alleviate, the
Distress of that unfortunate Prince; and to serve by way of Decoration
to a Piece which that great Critick has written against.<br>
<br>
I do not indeed wonder that the Actors should be such professed Enemies
to those among our Nation who are commonly known by the Name of
Criticks, since it is a Rule among these Gentlemen to fall upon a Play,
not because it is ill written, but because it takes. Several of them lay
it down as a Maxim, That whatever Dramatick Performance has a long Run,
must of Necessity be good for nothing; as though the first Precept in
Poetry were <i>not to please</i>. Whether this Rule holds good or not, I
shall leave to the Determination of those who are better Judges than my
self: If it does, I am sure it tends very much to the Honour of those
Gentlemen who have established it; few of their Pieces having been
disgraced by a Run of three Days, and most of them being so exquisitely
written, that the Town would never give them more than one Night's
Hearing.<br>
<br>
I have a great Esteem for a true Critick, such as <i>Aristotle</i> and
<i>Longinus</i> among the <i>Greeks</i>, <i>Horace</i> and <i>Quintilian</i> among the
<i>Romans</i>, <i>Boileau</i> and <i>Dacier</i> among the <i>French</i>. But it is our
Misfortune, that some who set up for professed Criticks among us are so
stupid, that they do not know how to put ten Words together with
Elegance or common Propriety, and withal so illiterate, that they have
no Taste of the learned Languages, and therefore criticise upon old
Authors only at second-hand. They judge of them by what others have
written, and not by any Notions they have of the Authors themselves. The
Words Unity, Action, Sentiment, and Diction, pronounced with an Air of
Authority, give them a Figure among unlearned Readers, who are apt to
believe they are very deep, because they are unintelligible. The Ancient
Criticks are full of the Praises of their Contemporaries; they discover
Beauties which escaped the Observation of the Vulgar, and very often
find out Reasons for palliating and excusing such little Slips and
Oversights as were committed in the Writings of eminent Authors. On the
contrary, most of the Smatterers in Criticism who appear among us, make
it their Business to vilifie and depreciate every new Production that
gains Applause, to descry imaginary Blemishes, and to prove by
far-fetch'd Arguments, that what pass for Beauties in any celebrated
Piece are Faults and Errors. In short, the Writings of these Criticks
compared with those of the Ancients, are like the Works of the Sophists
compared with those of the old Philosophers.<br>
<br>
Envy and Cavil are the natural Fruits of Laziness and Ignorance; which
was probably the Reason, that in the Heathen Mythology <i>Momus</i> is said
to be the Son of <i>Nox</i> and <i>Somnus</i>, of Darkness and Sleep. Idle Men,
who have not been at the Pains to accomplish or distinguish themselves,
are very apt to detract from others; as ignorant Men are very subject to
decry those Beauties in a celebrated Work which they have not Eyes to
discover. Many of our Sons of <i>Momus</i>, who dignify themselves by the
Name of Criticks, are the genuine Descendants of these two illustrious
Ancestors. They are often led into those numerous Absurdities, in which
they daily instruct the People, by not considering that, <i>1st</i>, There is
sometimes a greater Judgment shewn in deviating from the Rules of Art,
than in adhering to them; and, <i>2dly</i>, That there is more Beauty in the
Works of a great Genius who is ignorant of all the Rules of Art, than in
the Works of a little Genius, who not only knows, but scrupulously
observes them.<br>
<br>
First, We may often take Notice of Men who are perfectly acquainted with
all the Rules of good Writing, and notwithstanding chuse to depart from
them on extraordinary Occasions. I could give Instances out of all the
Tragick Writers of Antiquity who have shewn their Judgment in this
Particular; and purposely receded from an established Rule of the Drama,
when it has made way for a much higher Beauty than the Observation of
such a Rule would have been. Those who have surveyed the noblest Pieces
of Architecture and Statuary both ancient and modern, know very well
that there are frequent Deviations from Art in the Works of the greatest
Masters, which have produced a much nobler Effect than a more accurate
and exact way of Proceeding could have done. This often arises from what
the <i>Italians</i> call the <i>Gusto Grande</i> in these Arts, which is what we
call the Sublime in Writing.<br>
<br>
In the next Place, our Criticks do not seem sensible that there is more
Beauty in the Works of a great Genius who is ignorant of the Rules of
Art, than in those of a little Genius who knows and observes them. It is
of these Men of Genius that <i>Terence</i> speaks, in Opposition to the
little artificial Cavillers of his Time;

<blockquote><i>Quorum &aelig;mulari exoptat negligentiam<br>
Poti&ugrave;s, qu&agrave;m istorum obscuram diligentiam.</i></blockquote>

A Critick may have the same Consolation in the ill Success of his Play,
as Dr. <i>South</i> tells us a Physician has at the Death of a Patient, That
he was killed <i>secundum artem</i>. Our inimitable <i>Shakespear</i> is a
Stumbling-Block to the whole Tribe of these rigid Criticks. Who would
not rather read one of his Plays, where there is not a single Rule of
the Stage observed, than any Production of a modern Critick, where there
is not one of them violated? <i>Shakespear</i> was indeed born with all the
Seeds of Poetry, and may be compared to the Stone in <i>Pyrrhus's</i> Ring,
which, as <i>Pliny</i> tells us, had the Figure of <i>Apollo</i> and the Nine
Muses in the Veins of it, produced by the spontaneous Hand of Nature,
without any Help from Art.<br>

<br>

My dreaming Correspondent, Mr. <i>Shadow</i>, has sent me a second Letter,
with several curious Observations on Dreams in general, and the Method
to render Sleep improving: An Extract of his Letter will not, I presume,
be disagreeable to my Readers.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  'Since we have so little Time to spare, that none of it may be lost, I
  see no Reason why we should neglect to examine those imaginary Scenes
  we are presented with in Sleep, only because they have less Reality in
  them than our waking Meditations. A Traveller would bring his Judgment
  in Question who should despise the Directions of his Map for want of
  real Roads in it, because here stands a <i>Dott</i> instead of a Town, or a
  <i>Cypher</i> instead of a City, and it must be a long Day's Journey to
  travel thro' two or three Inches. Fancy in Dreams gives us much such
  another Landskip of Life as that does of Countries, and tho' its
  Appearances may seem strangely jumbled together, we may often observe
  such Traces and Footsteps of noble Thoughts, as, if carefully pursued,
  might lead us into a proper Path of Action. There is so much Rapture
  and Extasie in our fancied Bliss, and something so dismal and shocking
  in our fancied Misery, that tho' the Inactivity of the Body has given
  Occasion for calling Sleep the Image of <i>Death</i>, the Briskness of the
  Fancy affords us a strong Intimation of something within us that can
  never die.<br>
<br>
  'I have wondered, that <i>Alexander</i> the Great, who came into the World
  sufficiently dreamt of by his Parents, and had himself a tolerable
  Knack at dreaming, should often say, that

<blockquote><i>Sleep was one thing which made him sensible he was Mortal.</i></blockquote>

  I who have not such Fields of Action in the Daytime to divert my
  Attention from this Matter, plainly perceive, that in those Operations
  of the Mind, while the Body is at rest, there is a certain Vastness of
  Conception very suitable to the Capacity, and demonstrative of the
  Force of that Divine Part in our Composition which will last for ever.
  Neither do I much doubt but had we a true Account of the Wonders the
  Hero last mentioned performed in his Sleep, his conquering this little
  Globe would hardly be worth mentioning. I may affirm, without Vanity,
  that when I compare several Actions in <i>Quintus Curtius</i> with some
  others in my own Noctuary, I appear the greater Hero of the two.<br>
<br>
  I shall close this Subject with observing, that while we are awake we
  are at Liberty to fix our Thoughts on what we please, but in Sleep we
  have not the Command of them. The Ideas which strike the Fancy, arise
  in us without our Choice, either from the Occurrences of the Day past,
  the Temper we lye down in, or it may be the Direction of some superior
  Being.<br>
<br>
  It is certain the Imagination may be so differently affected in Sleep,
  that our Actions of the Day might be either rewarded or punished with
  a little Age of Happiness or Misery. St. <i>Austin</i> was of Opinion, that
  if in <i>Paradise</i> there was the same Vicissitude of sleeping and waking
  as in the present World, the Dreams of its Inhabitants would be very
  happy.<br>

  And so far at present our Dreams are in our Power, that they are
  generally conformable to our waking Thoughts, so that it is not
  impossible to convey our selves to a Consort of Musick, the
  Conversation of Distant Friends, or any other Entertainment which has
  been before lodged in the Mind.<br>
<br>
  My Readers, by applying these Hints will find the Necessity of making
  a <i>good Day</i> of it, if they heartily wish themselves a good Night.<br>

Mr. <i>Shadow</i> acquaints me in a Postscript, that he has no manner of
Title to the Vision which succeeded his first Letter; but adds, that as
the Gentleman who wrote it Dreams very sensibly, he shall be glad to
meet him some Night or other, under the great Elm Tree, by which
<i>Virgil</i> has given us a fine Metaphorical Image of Sleep, in order to
turn over a few of the Leaves together, and oblige the Publick with an
Account of the Dreams that lie under them.<br>

<br>

Were all the Vexations of Life put together, we should find that a great
Part of them proceed from those Calumnies and Reproaches which we spread
abroad concerning one another.<br>
<br>
There is scarce a Man living who is not, in some Degree, guilty of this
Offence; tho', at the same time, however we treat one another, it must
be confessed, that we all consent in speaking ill of the Persons who are
notorious for this Practice. It generally takes its Rise either from an
Ill-will to Mankind, a private Inclination to make our selves esteemed,
an Ostentation of Wit, a Vanity of being thought in the Secrets of the
World, or from a De<b>Sir</b> e of gratifying any of these Dispositions of Mind
in those Persons with whom we converse.<br>
<br>
The Publisher of Scandal is more or less odious to Mankind, and criminal
in himself, as he is influenced by any one or more of the foregoing
Motives. But whatever may be the Occasion of spreading these false
Reports, he ought to consider, that the Effect of them is equally
prejudicial and pernicious to the Person at whom they are aimed. The
Injury is the same, tho' the Principle from whence it proceeds may be
different.<br>
<br>
As every one looks upon himself with too much Indulgence, when he passes
a Judgment on his own Thoughts or Actions, and as very few would be
thought guilty of this abominable Proceeding, which is so universally
practised, and, at the same time, so universally blamed, I shall lay
down three Rules by which I would have a Man examine and search into his
own Heart, before he stands acquitted to himself of that evil
Disposition of Mind which I am here mentioning.

<ul><li>  <i>First</i> of all, Let him consider whether he does not take Delight in
  hearing the Faults of others.</li></ul><ul><li>

  <i>Secondly</i>, Whether he is not too apt to believe such little blackning
  Accounts, and more inclined to be credulous on the uncharitable than
  on the good-natured Side.</li></ul><ul><li>

  <i>Thirdly</i>, Whether he is not ready to spread and propagate such
  Reports as tend to the Disreputation of another. These are the several
  Steps by which this Vice proceeds, and grows up into Slander and
  Defamation.</li></ul>

In the first Place, A Man who takes delight in hearing the Faults of
others, shows sufficiently that he has a true Relish of Scandal, and
consequently <a name="fr5941">the</a> Seeds of this Vice within him. If his mind is gratified
with hearing the Reproaches <span style="color: #996633;">which</span><a href="#f5941"><sup>1</sup></a> are cast on others, he will find
the same Pleasure in relating them, and be the more apt to do it, as he
will naturally imagine every one he converses with is delighted in the
same manner with himself. A Man should endeavour therefore to wear out
of his Mind this criminal Curiosity, which is perpetually heightened and
inflamed by listening to such Stories as tend to the Disreputation of
others.<br>
<br>
In the second Place, a Man should consult his own Heart, whether he be
not apt to <i>believe</i> such little blackening Accounts, and more enclined
to be credulous on the uncharitable, than on the good-natured Side.<br>
<br>
Such a Credulity is very vicious in it self, and generally arises from a
Man's Consciousness of his own secret Corruptions. <a name="fr5942">It</a> is a pretty Saying
of <i>Thales, Falshood is just as far distant from Truth, as the Ears are
from the Eyes.</i><a href="#f5942"><sup>2</sup></a> By which he would intimate, that a wise Man should
not easily give Credit to the Reports of Actions which he has not seen.
I <a name="fr5943">shall</a>, under this Head, mention two or three remarkable Rules to be
observed by the Members of the celebrated Abbey <i>de la Trape</i>, as they
are Published in a little <i>French</i> Book<a href="#f5943"><sup>3</sup></a>.<br>
<br>
The Fathers are there ordered, never to give an Ear to any Accounts of
Base or Criminal Actions; to turn off all such Discourse if possible;
but in Case they hear any thing of this Nature so well attested that
they cannot disbelieve it, they are then to suppose, that the criminal
Action may have proceeded from a good Intention in him who is guilty of
it. This is perhaps carrying Charity to an Extravagance, but it is
certainly much more Laudable, than to suppose, as the ill-natured part
of the World does, that indifferent, and even Good Actions, proceed from
bad Principles and wrong Intentions.<br>
<br>
In the third Place, a Man should examine his Heart, whether he does not
find in it a secret Inclination to propagate such Reports, as tend to
the Disreputation of another.<br>
<br>
When the Disease of the Mind, which I have hitherto been speaking of,
arises to this Degree of Malignity it discovers its self in its worst
Symptoms, and is in danger of becoming incurable. I need not therefore
insist upon the Guilt in this last Particular, which every one cannot
but disapprove, who is not void of Humanity, or even common Discretion.
I shall only add, that whatever Pleasure any Man may take in spreading
Whispers of this Nature, he will find an infinitely greater Satisfaction
in conquering the Temptation he is under, by letting the Secret die
within his own Breast.<br>

If ordinary Authors would condescend to write as they think, they would
at least be allow'd the Praise of being intelligible. But they really
take Pains to be ridiculous; and, by the studied Ornaments of Style,
perfectly disguise the little Sense they aim at. There is a Grievance of
this Sort in the Common-wealth of Letters, which I have for some time
resolved to redress, and accordingly I have set this Day apart for
Justice. What I mean is, the <i>Mixture of inconsistent Metaphors,</i> which
is a Fault but too often found in learned Writers, but in all the
unlearned without Exception.<br>
<br>
In order to set this Matter in a clear Light to every Reader, I shall in
the first Place observe, that a Metaphor is a Simile in one Word, which
serves to convey the Thoughts of the Mind under Resemblances and Images
which affect the Senses. There is not any thing in the World, which may
not be compared to several Things, if considered in several distinct
Lights; or, in other Words, the same thing may be expressed by different
Metaphors. But the Mischief is, that an unskilful Author shall run these
Metaphors so absurdly into one another, that there shall be no Simile,
no agreeable Picture, no apt Resemblance, but Confusion, Obscurity, and
Noise. Thus I have known a Hero compared to a Thunderbolt, a Lion, and
the Sea; all and each of them proper Metaphors for impetuosity, Courage
or Force. But by bad Management it hath so happened, that the
Thunder-bolt hath overflowed its Banks; the Lion hath been darted
through the Skies, and the Billows have rolled out of the <i>Libyan</i>
Desart.<br>
<br>
The Absurdity in this Instance is obvious. And yet every time that
clashing Metaphors are put together, this Fault is committed more or
less. It hath already been said, that Metaphors are Images of things
which affect the Senses. An Image therefore, taken from what acts upon
the Sight, cannot, without Violence, be applied to the Hearing; and so
of the rest. It is no less an impropriety to make any Being in Nature or
Art to do things in its Metaphorical State, which it could not do in its
Original. I shall illustrate what I have said by an Instance which I
have read more than once in Controversial Writers. <i>The heavy Lashes</i>,
saith a celebrated Author, <i>that have dropped from your Pen</i>, &amp;c. I
suppose this Gentleman having frequently heard of <i>Gall dropping from a
Pen</i>, and <i>being lashed in a Satyr,</i> he was resolved to have them both
at any Rate, and so uttered this compleat Piece of Nonsense. It will
most effectually discover the Absurdity of these monstrous Unions, if we
will suppose these Metaphors or Images actually Painted. Imagine then a
Hand holding a Pen, and several Lashes of Whip-cord falling from it, and
you have the true Representation of this sort of Eloquence. I believe,
by this very Rule, a Reader may be able to judge of the Union of all
Metaphors whatsoever, and determine which are Homogeneous and which
Heterogeneous: or to speak more plainly, which are Consistent, and which
Inconsistent.<br>
<br>
There is yet one Evil more which I must take notice of, and that is the
running of Metaphors into tedious Allegories; which, though an Error on
the better Hand, causes Confusion as much as the other. This becomes
abominable, when the Lustre of one Word leads a Writer out of his Road,
and makes him wander from his Subject for a Page together. I remember a
young Fellow, of this Turn, who having said by Chance that his Mistress
had a <i>World</i> of Charms, thereupon took Occasion to consider her as one
possessed of Frigid and Torrid Zones, and pursued her from the one Pole
to the other. I shall conclude this Paper with a Letter written in that
enormous Style, which I hope my Reader hath by this time set his Heart
against. The Epistle hath heretofore received great Applause; but after
what hath been said, let any Man commend it if he dare.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <i><b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  'After the many heavy <i>Lashes</i> that have fallen from your <i>Pen</i>, you
  may justly expect in return all the <i>Load</i> that my <i>Ink</i> can lay upon
  your Shoulders. You have <i>Quartered</i> all the foul <i>Language</i> upon me,
  that could be <i>raked</i> out of the Air of <i>Billingsgate</i>, without
  knowing who I am, or whether I deserved to be <i>Cupped</i> and <i>Scarified</i>
  at this rate. I tell you once for all, turn your <i>Eyes</i> where you
  please, you shall never <i>Smell</i> me out. Do you think that the

  that you have been <i>Fishing</i> in troubled Waters, and that an <i>Ignis

  sandy Foundation, and brought your <i>Hogs</i> to a fair Market.<br>

The Case of my Correspondent who sends me the following Letter has
somewhat in it so very whimsical, that I know not how to entertain my
Readers better than by laying it before them.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <i><b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  'I am fully convinced that there is not upon Earth a more impertinent
  Creature than an importunate Lover: We are daily complaining of the
  Severity of our Fate, to People who are wholly unconcerned in it; and
  hourly improving a Passion, which we would persuade the World is the
  Torment of our Lives. Notwithstanding this Reflection, <b>Sir</b> , I cannot
  forbear acquainting you with my own Case. You must know then, <b>Sir</b> ,
  that even from my Childhood, the most prevailing Inclination I could
  perceive in my self, was a strong De<b>Sir</b> e to be in Favour with the Fair
  Sex. I am at present in the one and twentieth Year of my Age, and
  should have made Choice of a She Bed-fellow many Years since, had not
  my Father, who has a pretty good Estate of his own getting, and passes
  in the World for a prudent Man, being pleased to lay it down as a
  Maxim, That nothing spoils a young Fellow's Fortune so much as
  marrying early; and that no Man ought to think of Wedlock 'till six
  and twenty. Knowing his Sentiments upon this Head, I thought it in
  vain to apply my self to Women of Condition, who expect Settlements;
  so that all my Amours have hitherto been with Ladies who had no
  Fortunes: But I know not how to give you so good an Idea of me, as by
  laying before you the History of my Life.<br>
<br>
  'I can very well remember, that at my School-mistresses, whenever we
  broke up, I was always for joining my self with the Miss who <i>Lay in</i>,
  and was constantly one of the first to make a Party in the Play of
  <i>Husband and Wife</i>. This Passion for being well with the Females still
  increased as I advanced in Years. At the Dancing-School I contracted
  so many Quarrels by struggling with my Fellow-Scholars for the Partner
  I liked best, that upon a Ball Night, before our Mothers made their
  Appearance, I was usually up to the Nose in Blood. My Father, like a
  discreet Man, soon removed me from this Stage of Softness to a School
  of Discipline, where I learnt <i>Latin and Greek</i>. I underwent several
  Severities in this Place, 'till it was thought convenient to send me
  to the University; though, to confess the Truth, I should not have
  arrived so early at that Seat of Learning, but from the Discovery of
  an Intrigue between me and my Master's House-Keeper; upon whom I had
  employed my Rhetorick so effectually, that, though she was a very
  elderly Lady, I had almost brought her to consent to marry me. Upon my
  Arrival at <i>Oxford</i>, I found Logick so dry, that, instead of giving
  Attention to the Dead, I soon fell to addressing the Living. My first
  Amour was with a pretty Girl whom I shall call <i>Parthenope:</i> Her
  Mother sold Ale by the Town-Wall. Being often caught there by the
  Proctor, I was forced at last, that my Mistress's Reputation might
  receive no Blemish, to confess my Addresses were honourable. Upon this
  I was immediately sent Home; but <i>Parthenope</i> soon after marrying a
  Shoe-maker, I was again suffered to return. My next Affair was with my
  Taylor's Daughter, who deserted me for the sake of a young Barber.
  Upon my complaining to one of my particular Friends of this
  Misfortune, <a name="fr5961">the</a> cruel Wagg made a meer Jest of my Calamity, and asked
  me with a Smile, <i>Where the</i> Needle <i>should turn but to the</i> Pole?<a href="#f5961"><sup>1</sup></a>
  After this I was deeply in Love with a Milliner, and at last with my
  Bed-maker, upon which I was sent away, or in the University Phrase,
  <i>Rusticated</i> for ever.<br>
<br>
  'Upon my coming home, I settled to my Studies so heartily, and
  contracted so great a Reservedness by being kept from the Company I
  most affected, that my Father thought he might venture me at the
  <i>Temple.</i><br>
<br>
  'Within a Week after my Arrival I began to shine again, and became
  enamour'd with a mighty pretty Creature, who had every thing but Mony
  to recommend her. Having frequent Opportunities of uttering all the
  soft things which an Heart formed for Love could inspire me with, I
  soon gained her Consent to treat of Marriage; but unfortunately for us
  all, in the Absence of my Charmer I usually talked the same Language
  to her elder Sister, who is also very pretty. Now I assure you, Mr.
  SPECTATOR, this did not proceed from any real Affection I had
  conceived for her; but being a perfect Stranger to the Conversation of
  Men, and strongly addicted to associate with the Women, I knew no
  other Language but that of Love. I should however be very much obliged
  to you, if you could free me from the Perplexity I am at present in. I
  have sent Word to my old Gentleman in the Country, that I am
  desperately in Love with the younger Sister! and her Father, who knew
  no better, poor Man! acquainted him by the same Post, that I had for
  some time made my Addresses to the Elder. Upon this old Testy sends me
  up Word, that he has heard so much of my Exploits, that he intends
  immediately to order me to the <i>South-Sea.</i> <b>Sir</b> , I have occasionally
  talked so much of dying, that I begin to think there is not much in
  it; and if the old Squire persists in his Design, I do hereby give him
  Notice that I am providing my self with proper Instruments for the
  Destruction of despairing Lovers; let him therefore look to it, and
  consider that by his Obstinacy he may himself lose the Son of his
  Strength, the World an hopeful Lawyer, my Mistress a passionate Lover,
  and you, Mr. SPECTATOR,<br>

Since I received my Friend <i>Shadow's</i> Letter, several of my
Correspondents have been pleased to send me an Account how they have
been employed in Sleep, and what notable Adventures they have been
engaged in during that Moonshine in the Brain. I shall lay before my
Readers an Abridgment of some few of their Extravagancies, in hopes that
they will in Time accustom themselves to dream a little more to the
Purpose.<br>
<br>
One who styles himself <i>Gladio</i>, complains heavily that his Fair One
charges him with Inconstancy, and does not use him with half the
Kindness which the Sincerity of his Passion may demand; the said
<i>Gladio</i> having by Valour and Stratagem put to Death Tyrants,
Inchanters, Monsters, Knights, &amp;c. without Number, and exposed himself
to all manner of Dangers for her Sake and Safety. He de<b>Sir</b> es in his
Postscript to know, whether, from a constant Success in them, he may not
promise himself to succeed in her Esteem at last.<br>
<br>
Another who is very prolix in his Narrative writes me Word, that having
sent a Venture beyond Sea, he took Occasion one Night to fancy himself
gone along with it, and grown on a sudden the richest Man in all the
<i>Indies.</i> Having been there about a Year or two, a Gust of Wind that
forced open his Casement blew him over to his native Country again,
where awaking at Six a Clock, and the Change of the Air not agreeing
with him, he turned to his Left Side in order to a second Voyage: but
e'er he could get on Shipboard, was unfortunately apprehended for
stealing a Horse, try'd and condemn'd for the Fact, and in a fair way of
being executed, if some Body stepping hastily into his Chamber had not
brought him a Reprieve. This Fellow too wants Mr. <i>Shadow's</i> Advice,
who, I dare say, would bid him be content to rise after his first Nap,
and learn to be satisfied as soon as Nature is.<br>
<br>
The next is a publick-spirited Gentleman, who tells me, That on the
Second of September at Night the whole City was on Fire, and would
certainly have been reduced to Ashes again by this Time, if he had not
flown over it with the <i>New River</i> on his Back, and happily extinguished
the Flames before they had prevailed too far. He would be informed
whether he has not a Right to petition the Lord Mayor and Alderman for a
Reward.<br>
<br>
A Letter dated September the Ninth acquaints me, That the Writer being
resolved to try his Fortune, had fasted all that Day; and that he might
be sure of dreaming upon something at Night, procured an handsome Slice
of Bride-Cake, which he placed very conveniently under his Pillow. In
the Morning his Memory happen'd to fail him, and he could recollect
nothing but an odd Fancy that he had eaten his Cake; which being found
upon Search reduced to a few Crums, he is resolved to remember more of
his Dreams another Time, believing from this that there may possibly be
somewhat of Truth in them.<br>
<br>
I have received numerous Complaints from several delicious Dreamers,
de<b>Sir</b> ing me to invent some Method of silencing those noisy Slaves, whose
Occupations lead them to take their early Rounds about the City in a
Morning, doing a deal of Mischief; and working strange Confusion in the
Affairs of its Inhabitants. Several Monarchs have done me the Honour to
acquaint me, how often they have been shook from their respective
Thrones by the rattling of a Coach or the rumbling of a Wheel-barrow.
And many private Gentlemen, I find, have been baulk'd of vast Estates by
Fellows not worth Three-pence. A fair Lady was just upon the Point of
being married to a young, handsome, rich, ingenious Nobleman, when an
impertinent Tinker passing by, forbid the Banns; and an hopeful Youth,
who had been newly advanced to great Honour and Preferment, was forced
by a neighbouring Cobler to resign all for an old Song. It has been
represented to me, that those inconsiderable Rascals do nothing but go
about dissolving of Marriages and spoiling of Fortunes, impoverishing
rich and ruining great People, interrupting Beauties in the midst of
their Conquests, and Generals in the Course of their Victories. A
boisterous Peripatetick hardly goes through a Street without waking half
a Dozen Kings and Princes to open their Shops or clean Shoes, frequently
transforming Sceptres into Paring-Shovels, and Proclamations into Bills.
I have by me a Letter from a young Statesman, who in five or six Hours
came to be Emperor of <i>Europe</i>, after which he made War upon the Great
Turk, routed him Horse and Foot, and was crowned Lord of the Universe in
<i>Constantinople:</i> the Conclusion of all his Successes is, that on the
12th Instant, about Seven in the Morning, his Imperial Majesty was
deposed by a Chimney&mdash; Sweeper.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I have Epistolary Testimonies of Gratitude from many
miserable People, who owe to this clamorous Tribe frequent Deliverances
from great Misfortunes. <a name="fr5971">A</a> Small-coalman<a href="#f5971"><sup>1</sup></a>, by waking of one of these
distressed Gentlemen, saved him from ten Years Imprisonment. An honest
Watchman bidding aloud Good-morrow to another, freed him from the Malice
of many potent Enemies, and brought all their Designs against him to
nothing. A certain Valetudinarian confesses he has often been cured of a
sore Throat by the Hoarseness of a Carman, and relieved from a Fit of
the Gout by the Sound of <i>old Shoes</i>. A noisy Puppy that plagued a sober
Gentleman all Night long with his Impertinence, was silenced by a
Cinder-Wench with a Word speaking.<br>
<br>
Instead therefore of suppressing this Order of Mortals, I would propose
it to my Readers to make the best Advantage of their Morning
Salutations. A famous <i>Macedonian</i> Prince, for fear of forgetting
himself in the midst of his good Fortune, had a Youth to wait on him
every Morning, and bid him remember that he was a Man. A Citizen who is
waked by one of these Criers, may regard him as a kind of Remembrancer,
come to admonish him that it is time to return to the Circumstances he
has overlooked all the Night-time, to leave off fancying himself what he
is not, and prepare to act suitably to the Condition he is really placed
in.<br>
<br>
People may dream on as long as they please, but I shall take no Notice
of any Imaginary Adventures that do not happen while the Sun is on this
Side of the Horizon. For which Reason I stifle <i>Fritilla's</i> Dream at
Church last <i>Sunday</i>, who while the rest of the Audience were enjoying
the Benefit of an excellent Discourse, was losing her Money and Jewels
to a Gentleman at Play, till after a strange Run of ill Luck she was
reduced to pawn three lovely pretty Children for her last Stake. When
she had thrown them away her Companion went off, discovering himself by
his usual Tokens, a cloven Foot and a strong Smell of Brimstone; which
last proved only a Bottle of Spirits, which a good old Lady applied to
her Nose, to put her in a Condition of hearing the Preacher's third Head
concerning Time.<br>
<br>
If a Man has no Mind to pass abruptly from his imagined to his real
Circumstances, he may employ himself a while in that new kind of
Observation which my Onicrocritical Correspondent has directed him to
make of himself. Pursuing the Imagination through all its
Extravagancies, whether in Sleeping or Waking, is no improper Method of
correcting and bringing it to act in Subordinancy to Reason, so as to be
delighted only with such Objects as will affect it with Pleasure, when
it is never so cool and sedate.<br>

Mankind may be divided into the Merry and the Serious, who, both of
them, make a very good Figure in the Species, so long as they keep their
respective Humours from degenerating into the neighbouring Extreme;
there being a natural Tendency in the one to a melancholy Moroseness,
and in the other to a fantastick Levity.<br>
<br>
The merry Part of the World are very amiable, whilst they diffuse a
Chearfulness through Conversation at proper Seasons and on proper
Occasions; but, on the contrary, a great Grievance to Society, when they
infect every Discourse with insipid Mirth, and turn into Ridicule such
Subjects as are not suited to it. For though Laughter is looked upon by
the Philosophers as the Property of Reason, the Excess of it has been
always considered as the Mark of Folly.<br>
<br>
On the other Side, Seriousness has its Beauty whilst it is attended with
Chearfulness and Humanity, and does not come in unseasonably to pall the
good Humour of those with whom we converse.<br>
<br>
These two Sets of Men, notwithstanding they each of them shine in their
respective Characters, are apt to bear a natural Aversion and Antipathy
to one another.<br>
<br>
What is more usual, than to hear Men of serious Tempers and austere
Morals, enlarging upon the Vanities and Follies of the young and gay
Part of the Species; whilst they look with a kind of Horror upon such
Pomps and Diversions as are innocent in themselves, and only culpable
when they draw the Mind too much?<br>
<br>
I could not but smile upon reading a Passage in the Account which Mr.
<i>Baxter</i> gives of his own Life, wherein he represents it as a great
Blessing, that in his Youth he very narrowly escaped getting a Place at
Court.<br>
<br>
It must indeed be confessed that Levity of Tamper takes a Man off his
Guard, and opens a Pass to his Soul for any Temptation that assaults it.
It favours all the Approaches of Vice, and weakens all the Resistance of
Virtue. For which Reason a renowned Statesman in Queen <i>Elizabeth's</i>
Days, after having retir'd from Court and publick Business, in order to
give himself up to the Duties of Religion; when any of his old Friends
used to visit him, had still this Word of Advice in his Mouth, <i>Be
serious.</i><br>
<br>
An eminent <i>Italian</i> Author of this Cast of Mind, speaking of the great
Advantage of a serious and composed Temper, wishes very gravely, that
for the Benefit of Mankind he had <i>Trophonius's</i> Cave in his Possession;
which, says he, would contribute more to the Reformation of Manners than
all the Work-houses and Bridewells in <i>Europe.</i><br>
<br>
We have a very particular Description of this Cave in <i>Pausanias</i>, who
tells us, that it was made in the Form of a huge Oven, and had many
particular Circumstances, which disposed the Person who was in it to be
more pensive and thoughtful than ordinary; insomuch that no Man was ever
observed to laugh all his Life after, who had once made his Entry into
this Cave. It was usual in those Times, when any one carried a more than
ordinary Gloominess in his Features, to tell him that he looked like one
just come out of <i>Trophonius's</i> Cave.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, Writers of a more merry Complexion have been no less
severe on the opposite Party; and have had one Advantage above them,
that they have attacked them with more Turns of Wit and Humour.<br>
<br>
After all, if a Man's Temper were at his own Disposal, I think he would
not chuse to be of either of these Parties; since the most perfect
Character is that which is formed out of both of them. A Man would
neither chuse to be a Hermit nor a Buffoon: Humane Nature is not so
miserable, as that we should be always melancholy; nor so happy, as that
we should be always merry. In a Word, a Man should not live as if there
was no God in the World; nor, at the same Time, as if there were no Men
in it.<br>

<br>

It has been my Custom, as I grow old, to allow my self in some little
Indulgencies which I never took in my Youth. Among others is that of an
Afternoon's Napp, which I fell into in the Fifty fifth Year of my Age,
and have continued for the three Years last past. By this means I enjoy
a double Morning, and rise twice a-day fresh to my Speculations. It
happens very luckily for me, that some of my Dreams have proved
instructive to my Countrymen, so that I may be said to sleep, as well as
to wake, for the Good of the Publick. I was Yesterday meditating on the
Account with which I have already entertained my Readers concerning the
Cave of <i>Trophonius.</i> I was no sooner fallen into my usual Slumber, but
I dreamt that this Cave was put into my Possession, and that I gave
publick Notice of its Virtue, inviting every one to it, who had a mind
to be a serious Man for the remaining Part of his Life. Great Multitudes
immediately resorted to me. The first who made the Experiment was a
<i>Merry-Andrew</i>, who was put into my Hands by a neighbouring Justice of
Peace, in order to reclaim him from that profligate kind of Life. Poor
Pickle-herring had not taken above one Turn in it, when he came out of
the Cave, like a Hermit from his Cell, with a penitential Look, and a
most rueful Countenance. I then put in a young laughing Fop, and,
watching for his Return, asked him, with a Smile, how he liked the
Place? He replied, Pr'ythee Friend be not impertinent; and stalked by me
as grave as a Judge. A Citizen then de<b>Sir</b> ed me to give free Ingress and
Egress to his Wife, who was dressed in the gayest coloured Ribbons I had
ever seen. She went in with a Flirt of her Fan and a smirking
Countenance, but came out with a Severity of a Vestal, and throwing from
her several Female Gugaws, told me with a Sigh, that she resolved to go
into deep Mourning, and to wear Black all the rest of her Life. As I had
many Coquets recommended to me by their Parents, their Husbands, and
their Lovers, I let them in all at once, de<b>Sir</b> ing them to divert
themselves together as well as they could. Upon their emerging again
into Day-light, you would have fancied my Cave to have been a Nunnery,
and that you had seen a solemn Procession of Religious marching out, one
behind another, in the most profound Silence and the most exemplary
Decency. As I was very much delighted with so edifying a Sight, there
came towards me a great Company of Males and Females laughing, singing,
and dancing, in such a manner that I could hear them a great while
before I saw them. Upon my asking their Leader, what brought them
thither? they told me all at once, that they were <i>French</i> Protestants
lately arrived in <i>Great-Britain</i>, and that finding themselves of too
Gay a Humour for my Country, they applyed themselves to me in order to
compose them for <i>British</i> Conversation. I told them, that to oblige
them I would soon spoil their Mirth; upon which I admitted a whole Shole
of them, who, after having taken a Survey of the Place, came out in a
very good Order, and with Looks entirely <i>English.</i> I afterwards put in
a <i>Dutch</i> Man, who had a great Fancy to see the <i>Kelder</i>, as he called
it, but I could not observe that it had made any manner of Alteration in
him.<br>
<br>
A Comedian who had gained great Reputation in Parts of Humour, told me,
that he had a mighty Mind to act <i>Alexander</i> the Great, and fancied that
he should succeed very well in it, if he could strike two or three
laughing Features out of his Face: He tried the Experiment, but
contracted so very solid a Look by it, that I am afraid he will be fit
for no Part hereafter but a <i>Timon</i> of <i>Athens</i>, or a Mute in the
<i>Funeral.</i><br>
<br>
I then clapt up an empty fantastic Citizen, in order to qualifie him for
an Alderman. He was succeeded by a young Rake of the <i>Middle-Temple</i>,
who was brought to me by his Grandmother; but to her great Sorrow and
Surprize, he came out a <i>Quaker.</i> Seeing my self surrounded with a Body
of <i>Free-thinkers</i>, and Scoffers at Religion, who were making themselves
merry at the sober Looks and thoughtful Brows of those who had been in
the Cave; I thrust them all in, one after another, and locked the Door
upon 'em. Upon my opening it, they all looked, as if they had been
frighted out of their Wits, and were marching away with Ropes in their
Hands to a Wood that was within Sight of the Place. I found they were
not able to bear themselves in their first serious Thoughts; but knowing
these would quickly bring them to a better Frame of Mind, I gave them
into the Custody of their Friends 'till that happy Change was wrought in
them.<br>
<br>
The last that was brought to me was a young Woman, who at the first
Sight of my short Face fell into an immoderate fit of Laughter, and was
forced to hold her Sides all the while her Mother was speaking to me.
Upon this I interrupted the old Lady, and taking her Daughter by the
Hand, Madam, said I, be pleased to retire into my Closet, while your
Mother tells me your Case. I then put her into the Mouth of the Cave,
when the Mother, after having begg'd Pardon for the Girl's Rudeness,
told me, that she often treated her Father and the gravest of her
Relations in the same manner; that she would sit giggling and laughing
with her Companions from one End of a Tragedy to the other; nay, that
she would sometimes burst out in the Middle of a Sermon, and set the
whole Congregation a staring at her. The Mother was going on, when the
young Lady came out of the Cave to us with a composed Countenance, and a
low Curtsie. She was a Girl of such exuberant Mirth, that her Visit to
<i>Trophonius</i> only reduced her to a more than ordinary Decency of
Behaviour, and made a very pretty Prude of her. After having performed
innumerable Cures, I looked about me with great Satisfaction, and saw
all my Patients walking by themselves in a very Pensive and musing
Posture, so that the whole Place seem'd covered with Philosophers. I was
at length resolv'd to go into the Cave my self, and see what it was that
had produced such wonderful Effects upon the Company; but as I was
stooping at the Entrance, the Door being something low, I gave such a
Nodd in my Chair, that I awaked. After having recovered my self from my
first Startle, I was very well pleas'd at the Accident which had
befallen me, as not knowing but a little Stay in the Place might have
spoiled my <b>Spectators</b>.<br>

I have always taken a particular Pleasure in examining the Opinions
which Men of different Religions, different Ages, and different
Countries, have entertained concerning the Immortality of the Soul, and
the State of Happiness which they promise themselves in another World.
For whatever Prejudices and Errors human Nature lies under; we find that
either Reason, or Tradition from our first Parents, has discovered to
all People something in these great Points which bears Analogy to Truth,
and to the Doctrines opened to us by Divine Revelation. I <a name="fr6001">was</a> lately
discoursing on this Subject with a learned Person who has been very much
conversant among the Inhabitants of the more Western Parts of <i>Africk.</i><a href="#f6001"><sup>1</sup></a> Upon his conversing with several in that Country, he tells me that
their Notion of Heaven or of a future State of Happiness is this, That
every thing we there wish for will immediately present it self to us. We
find, say they, our Souls are of such Nature that they require Variety,
and are not capable of being always delighted with the same Objects. The
Supreme Being therefore, in Compliance with this Taste of Happiness
which he has planted in the Soul of Man, will raise up from time to
time, say they, every Gratification which it is in the Humour to be
pleased with. If we wish to be in Groves or Bowers, among running
Streams or Falls of Water, we shall immediately find our selves in the
midst of such a Scene as we de<b>Sir</b> e. If we would be entertained with
Musick and the Melody of Sounds, the Consort rises upon our Wish, and
the whole Region about us is filled with Harmony. In short, every De<b>Sir</b> e
will be followed by Fruition, and whatever a Man's Inclination directs
him to will be present with him. Nor is it material whether the Supreme
Power creates in Conformity to our Wishes, or whether he only produces
such a Change in our Imagination, as makes us believe our selves
conversant among those Scenes which delight us. Our Happiness will be
the same, whether it proceed from external Objects, or from the
Impressions of the Deity upon our own private Fancies. This is the
Account which I have received from my learned Friend. Notwithstanding
this System of Belief be in general very chimerical and visionary, there
is something sublime in its manner of considering the Influence of a
Divine Being on a Human Soul. It has also, like most other Opinions of
the Heathen World upon these important Points, it has, I say, its
Foundation in Truth, as it supposes the Souls of good Men after this
Life to be in a State of perfect Happiness, that in this State there
will be no barren Hopes, nor fruitless Wishes, and that we shall enjoy
every thing we can de<b>Sir</b> e. But the particular Circumstance which I am
most pleas'd with in this Scheme, and which arises from a just
Reflection upon Human Nature, is that Variety of Pleasures which it
supposes the Souls of good Men will be possessed of in another World.
This I think highly probable, from the Dictates both of Reason and
Revelation. The Soul consists of many Faculties, as the Understanding,
and the Will, with all the Senses both outward and inward; or to speak
more Philosophically, the Soul can exert herself in many different Ways
of Action. She can understand, will, imagine, see, and hear, love, and
discourse, and apply herself to many other the like Exercises of
different Kinds and Natures; but what is more to be considered, the Soul
is capable of receiving a most exquisite Pleasure and Satisfaction from
the Exercise of any of these its Powers, when they are gratified with
their proper Objects; she can be entirely happy by the Satisfaction of
the Memory, the Sight, the Hearing, or any other Mode of Perception.
Every Faculty is as a distinct Taste in the Mind, and hath Objects
accommodated to its proper Relish. Doctor <i>Tillotson</i> somewhere says
that he will not presume to determine in what consists the Happiness of
the Blest, because God Almighty is capable of making the Soul happy by
Ten thousand different Ways. Besides those several Avenues to Pleasure
which the Soul is endowed with in this Life; it is not impossible,
according to the Opinions of many eminent Divines, but there may be new
Faculties in the Souls of good Men made perfect, as well as new Senses
in their glorified Bodies. This we are sure of, that there will be new
Objects offer'd to all those Faculties which are essential to us.<br>
<br>
We are likewise to take Notice that every particular Faculty is capable
of being employed on a very great Variety of Objects. The Understanding,
for Example, may be happy in the Contemplation of Moral, Natural,
Mathematical, and other Kinds of Truth. The Memory likewise may turn
itself to an infinite Multitude of Objects, especially when the Soul
shall have pass'd through the Space of many Millions of Years, and shall
reflect with Pleasure on the Days of Eternity. Every other Faculty may
be consider'd in the same Extent.<br>
<br>
We cannot question but that the Happiness of a Soul will be adequate to
its Nature, and that it is not endowed with any Faculties which are to
lie useless and unemploy'd. The Happiness is to be the Happiness of the
whole Man, and we may easily conceive to our selves the Happiness of the
Soul, whilst any one of its Faculties is in the Fruition of its chief
Good. The Happiness may be of a more exalted Nature in Proportion as the
Faculty employed is so, but as the whole Soul acts in the Exertion of
any of its particular Powers, the whole Soul is happy in the Pleasure
which arises from any of its particular Acts. For notwithstanding, as
has been before hinted, <a name="fr6002">and</a> as it has been taken Notice of by one of the
greatest modern Philosophers<a href="#f6002"><sup>2</sup></a>, we divide the Soul into several Powers
and Faculties, there is no such Division in the Soul it self, since it
is the whole Soul that remembers, understands, wills, or imagines. Our
manner of considering the Memory, Understanding, Will, Imagination, and
the like Faculties, is for the better enabling us to express our selves
in such abstracted Subjects of Speculation, not that there is any such
Division in the Soul it self.<br>
<br>
Seeing then that the Soul has many different Faculties, or in other
Words, many different Ways of acting; that it can be intensely pleas'd,
or made happy by all these different Faculties, or Ways of acting; that
it may be endow'd with several latent Faculties, which it is not at
present in a Condition to exert; that we cannot believe the Soul is
endow'd with any Faculty which is of no Use to it; that whenever any one
of these Faculties is transcendently pleased, the Soul is in a State of
Happiness; and in the last Place considering that the Happiness of
another World is to be the Happiness of the whole Man; who can question
but that there is an infinite Variety in those Pleasures we are speaking
of; and that this Fulness of Joy will be made up of all those Pleasures
which the Nature of the Soul is capable of receiving.<br>
<br>
We shall be the more confirmed in this Doctrine, if we observe the
Nature of Variety, with regard to the Mind of Man. The Soul does not
care to be always in the same bent. The Faculties relieve one another by
Turns, and receive an additional Pleasure from the Novelty of those
Objects about which they are conversant.<br>
<br>
Revelation likewise very much confirms this Notion, under the different
Views which it gives us of our future Happiness. In the Description of
the Throne of God, it represents to us all those Objects which are able
to gratify the Senses and Imagination: In very many Places it intimates
to us all the Happiness which the Understanding can possibly receive in
that State, where all Things shall be revealed to us, and we shall know,
even as we are known; the Raptures of Devotion, of Divine Love, the
Pleasure of conversing with our Blessed Saviour, with an innumerable
Host of Angels, and with the Spirits of Just Men made Perfect, are
likewise revealed to us in several Parts of the Holy Writings. There are
also mentioned those Hierarchies or Governments, in which the Blest
shall be ranged one above another, and in which we may be sure a great
Part of our Happiness will likewise consist; for it will not be there as
in this World, where every one is aiming at Power and Superiority; but
on the contrary, every one will find that Station the most proper for
him in which he is placed, and will probably think that he could not
have been so happy in any other Station. These and many other
Particulars are marked in Divine Revelation, as the several Ingredients
of our Happiness in Heaven, which all imply such a Variety of Joys and
such a Gratification of the Soul in all its different Faculties, as I
have been here mentioning.<br>
<br>
Some of the Rabbins tell us, that the Cherubims are a Set of Angels who
know most, and the Seraphims a Set of Angels who love most. Whether this
Distinction be not altogether Imaginary, I shall not here examine; but
it is highly probable that among the Spirits of good Men, there may be
some who will be more pleased with the Employment of one Faculty than of
another, and this perhaps according to those innocent and virtuous
Habits or Inclinations which have here taken the deepest Root.<br>
<br>
I might here apply this Consideration to the Spirits of wicked Men, with
relation to the Pain which they shall suffer in every one of their
Faculties, and the respective Miseries which shall be appropriated to
each Faculty in particular. But leaving this to the Reflection of my
Readers, I shall conclude, with observing how we ought to be thankful to
our great Creator, and rejoice in the Being which he has bestowed upon
us, for having made the Soul susceptible of Pleasure by so many
different Ways.<br>
<br>
We see by what a Variety of Passages, Joy and Gladness may enter into
the Thoughts of Man; how wonderfully a human Spirit is framed, to imbibe
its proper Satisfactions, and taste the Goodness of its Creator. We may
therefore look into our selves with Rapture and Amazement, and cannot
sufficiently express our Gratitude to him, who has encompassed us with
such a Profusion of Blessings, and opened in us so many Capacities of
enjoying them.<br>
<br>
There cannot be a stronger Argument that God has designed us for a State
of future Happiness, and for that Heaven which he has revealed to us,
than that he has thus naturally qualified the Soul for it, and made it a
Being capable of receiving so much Bliss. He would never have made such
Faculties in vain, and have endowed us with Powers that were not to be
exerted on such Objects as are suited to them. It is very manifest, by
the inward Frame and Constitution of our Minds, that he has adapted them
to an infinite Variety of Pleasures and Gratifications, which are not to
be met with in this Life. We should therefore at all times take Care
that we do not disappoint this his gracious Purpose and Intention
towards us, and make those Faculties which he formed as so many
Qualifications for Happiness and Rewards, to be the Instruments of Pain
and Punishment.<br>

<a name="fr6011">The</a> following Essay comes from an Hand which has entertained my Readers
once before<a href="#f6011"><sup>1</sup></a>.
<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
Notwithstanding a narrow contracted Temper be that which obtains most in
the World, we must not therefore conclude this to be the genuine
Characteristick of Mankind; because there are some who delight in
nothing so much as in doing Good, and receive more of their Happiness at
second hand, or by rebound from others, than by direct and immediate
Sensation. Now tho' these Heroic Souls are but few, and to Appearance so
far advanced above the groveling Multitude, as if they were of another
Order of Beings, yet in Reality their Nature is the same, moved by the
same Springs, and endowed with all the same essential Qualities, only
cleared, refined, and cultivated.<br>
<br>
Water is the same fluid Body in Winter and in Summer; when it stands
stiffened in Ice as when it flows along in gentle Streams gladdening a
thousand Fields in its Progress. 'Tis a Property of the Heart of Man to
be diffusive: Its kind Wishes spread abroad over the Face of the
Creation; and if there be those, as we may observe too many of them, who
are all wrapt up in their own dear selves, without any visible Concern
for their Species, let us suppose that their Good-nature is frozen, and
by the prevailing Force of some contrary Quality restrained in its
Operations. I shall therefore endeavour to assign some of the principal
Checks upon this generous Propension of the Human Soul, which will
enable us to judge whether, and by what Method, this most useful
Principle may be unfettered, and restored to its native Freedom of
Exercise.<br>
<br>
The first and leading Cause is an unhappy Complexion of Body. The
Heathens, ignorant of the true Source of Moral Evil, generally charged
it on the Obliquity of Matter, which, being eternal and independent, was
incapable of Change in any of its Properties, even by the Almighty Mind,
who, when He came to fashion it into a World of Beings, must take it as
he found it. This Notion, as most others of theirs, is a Composition of
Truth and Error. That Matter is eternal, that from the first Union of a
Soul to it, it perverted its Inclinations, and that the ill Influence it
hath upon the Mind is not to be corrected by God himself, are all very
great Errors, occasioned by a Truth as evident, that the Capacities and
Dispositions of the Soul depend, to a great Degree, on the bodily
Temper. As there are some Fools, others are Knaves, by Constitution; and
particularly, it may be said of many, that they are born with an
illiberal Cast of Mind; the Matter that composes them is tenacious as
Birdlime, and a kind of Cramp draws their Hands and their Hearts
together, that they never care to open them unless to grasp at more.
'Tis a melancholy Lot this; but attended with one Advantage above
theirs, to whom it would be as painful to forbear good Offices, as it is
to these Men to perform them; that whereas Persons naturally Beneficent
often mistake Instinct for Virtue, by reason of the Difficulty of
distinguishing when one rules them and when the other, Men of the
opposite Character may be more certain of the Motive that predominates
in every Action. If they cannot confer a Benefit with that Ease and
Frankness which are necessary to give it a Grace in the Eye of the
World, in requital, the real Merit of what they do is inhanc'd by the
Opposition they surmount in doing it. The Strength of their Virtue is
seen in rising against the Weight of Nature, and every time they have
the Resolution to discharge their Duty, they make a Sacrifice of
Inclination to Conscience, which is always too grateful to let its
Followers go without suitable Marks of its Approbation. Perhaps the
entire Cure of this ill Quality is no more possible, than of some
Distempers that descend by Inheritance. However, a great deal may be
done by a Course of Beneficence obstinately persisted in; this, if any
thing, being a likely way of establishing a moral Habit, which shall be
somewhat of a Counterpoise to the Force of Mechanism. Only it must be
remembred, that we do not intermit, upon any Pretence whatsoever, the
Custom of doing Good, in regard if there be the least Cessation, Nature
will watch the Opportunity to return, and in a short time to recover the
Ground it was so long in quitting: For there is this Difference between
mental Habits, and such as have their Foundation in the Body; that these
last are in their Nature more forcible and violent, and, to gain upon
us, need only not to be opposed; whereas the former must be continually
reinforced with fresh Supplies, or they will languish and die away. And
this suggests the Reason why good Habits, in general, require longer
time for their Settlement than bad, and yet are sooner displaced; the
Reason is, that vicious Habits (as Drunkenness for Instance) produce a
Change in the Body, which the others not doing, must be maintained the
same way they are acquired, by the mere Dint of Industry, Resolution,
and Vigilance.<br>
<br>
Another Thing which suspends the Operations of Benevolence, is the Love
of the World; proceeding from a false Notion Men have taken up, that an
Abundance of the World is an essential Ingredient into the Happiness of
Life. Worldly Things are of such a Quality as to lessen upon dividing,
so that the more Partners there are, the less must fall to every Man's
private Share. The Consequence of this is, that they look upon one
another with an evil Eye, each imagining all the rest to be embarked in
an Interest, that cannot take Place but to his Prejudice. Hence are
those eager Competitions for Wealth or Power; hence one Man's Success
becomes another's Disappointment; and, like Pretenders to the same
Mistress, they can seldom have common Charity for their Rivals. Not that
they are naturally disposed to quarrel and fall out, but 'tis natural
for a Man to prefer himself to all others, and to secure his own
Interest first. If that which Men esteem their Happiness were like the
Light, the same sufficient and unconfined Good, whether Ten Thousand
enjoy the Benefit of it, or but One, we should see Mens Good-will, and
kind Endeavours, would be as universal.

<blockquote><i>Homo qui Erranti comiter monstrat Viam,<br>
Quasi Lumen de suo Lumine accendat, facit,<br>
Nihilominus ipsi luceat, cum illi accenderit.</i></blockquote>

But, unluckily, Mankind agree in making Choice of Objects, which
inevitably engage them in perpetual Differences. Learn therefore, like a
wise Man, the true Estimate of Things. De<b>Sir</b> e not more of the World than
is necessary to accommodate you in passing through it; look upon every
thing beyond, not as useless only, but burthensome. Place not your Quiet
in Things, which you cannot have without putting others beside them, and
thereby making them your Enemies; and which, when attain'd, will give
you more Trouble to keep, than Satisfaction in the Enjoyment. Virtue is
a Good of a nobler kind; it grows by Communication, and so little
resembles earthly Riches, that the more Hands it is lodged in, the
greater is every Man's particular Stock. So, by propagating and mingling
their Fires, not only all the Lights of a Branch together cast a more
extensive Brightness, but each single Light burns with a stronger Flame.
And lastly, take this along with you, that if Wealth be an Instrument of
Pleasure, the greatest Pleasure it can put into your Power, is that of
doing Good. 'Tis worth considering, that the Organs of Sense act within
a narrow Compass, and the Appetites will soon say they have enough:
which of the two therefore is the happier Man? He, Who confining all his
Regard to the Gratification of his own Appetites, is capable but of
short Fits of Pleasure? Or the Man, who, reckoning himself a Sharer in
the Satisfactions of others, especially those which come to them by his
Means, enlarges the Sphere of his Happiness?<br>
<br>
The last Enemy to Benevolence I shall mention is Uneasiness of any Kind.
A guilty, or a discontented Mind, a Mind ruffled by ill Fortune,
disconcerted by its own Passions, sowered by Neglect, or fretting at
Disappointments, hath not Leisure to attend to the Necessity or
Reasonableness of a Kindness de<b>Sir</b> ed, nor a Taste for those Pleasures
which wait on Beneficence, which demand a calm and unpolluted Heart to
relish them. The most miserable of all Beings is the most envious; as,
on the other hand, the most communicative is the happiest. And if you
are in search of the Seat of perfect Love and Friendship, you will not
find it till you come to the Region of the Blessed, where Happiness,
like a refreshing Stream, flows from Heart to Heart in an endless
Circulation, and is preserv'd sweet and untainted by the Motion. 'Tis
old Advice, if you have a Favour to request of any one, to observe the
softest times of Address, when the Soul, in a Flush of good Humour,
takes a Pleasure to shew it self pleased. Persons conscious of their own
integrity, satisfied with themselves, and their Condition, and full of
Confidence in a Supreme Being, and the Hope of Immortality, survey all
about them with a Flow of Good-will.  As Trees which like their Soil,
they shoot out in Expressions of Kindness and bend beneath their own
precious Load, to the hand of the Gatherer. Now if the Mind be not thus
easie, 'tis an infallible Sign that it is not in its natural State;
Place the Mind in its right Posture, it will immediately discover its
innate Propension to Beneficence.<br>

Juv.<a href="transindex.html#602t"><img src="images/qmark.png" width="15" height="15" align="right" alt="translation"></a></blockquote><br>
<br>

The following Letter comes from a Gentleman, who, I find, is very
dilgent in making his Observations, which I think too material not to be
communicated to the Publick.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <i><b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  'In order to <a name="fr6021">execute</a> the Office of Love-Casuist to <i>Great Britain</i>,
  with which I take my self to be invested by your Paper of September 8<a href="#f6021"><sup>1</sup></a>, I shall make some further Observations upon the two Sexes in
  general, beginning with that which always ought to have the upper
  Hand. After having observed with much Curiosity the Accomplishments
  which are apt to captivate female Hearts, I find that there is no
  Person so irresistable as one who is a Man of Importance, provided it
  be in Matters of no Consequence. One who makes himself talked of, tho'
  it be for the particular Cock of his Hat, or for prating aloud in the
  Boxes at a Play, is in a fair way of being a Favourite. I have known a
  young Fellow make his Fortune by knocking down a Constable; and may
  venture to say, tho' it may seem a Paradox, that many a Fair One has
  died by a Duel in which both the Combatants have survived.<br>
<br>
  About three Winters ago I took Notice of a young Lady at the Theatre,
  who convceived of a Passion for a notorious Rake that headed a Party
  of Cat-calls; and am credibly informed, that the Emperor of the
  Mohocks married a rich Widow within three Weeks after having rendered
  himself formidable in the Cities of <i>London</i> and <i>Westminster.</i>
  Scowring and breaking Windows have done frequent Execution upon the
  Sex; but there is no Sett of these Male Charmers who make their way
  more successfully, than those who have gained themselves a Name for
  Intrigue, and have ruined the greatest Number of Reputations. There is
  a strange Curiosity in the female World to be acquainted with the dear
  Man who has been loved by others, and to know what it is that makes
  him so agreeable. His Reputation does more than half his Business.
  Every one that is ambitious of being a Woman of Fashion, looks out for
  Opportunities of being in his Company; so that to use the old Proverb,
  When his Name is up he may lie a-Bed.<br>
<br>
  'I was very sensible of the great Advantage of being a Man of
  Importance upon these Occasions on the Day of the King's Entry, when I
  was seated in a Balcony behind a Cluster of very pretty Country
  Ladies, who had one of these showy Gentlemen in the midst of them. The
  first Trick I caught him at was bowing to several Persons of Quality
  whom he did not know; nay, he had the Impudence to hem at a Blue
  Garter who had a finer Equipage than ordinary, and seemed a little
  concerned at the Impertinent Huzzas of the Mob, that hindered his
  Friend from taking Notice of him. There was indeed one who pull'd off
  his Hat to him, and upon the Ladies asking who it was, he told them,
  it was a Foreign Minister that he had been very merry with the Night
  before; whereas in Truth, it was the City Common Hunt.<br>
<br>
  'He was never at a Loss when he was asked any Person's Name, tho' he
  seldom knew any one under a Peer. He found Dukes and Earls among the
  Aldermen, very good-natured Fellows among the Privy-Counsellors, with
  two or three agreeable old Rakes among the Bishops and Judges.<br>
<br>
  'In short, I collected from his whole Discourse, that he was
  acquainted with every Body, and knew no Body. At the same Time, I am
  mistaken if he did not that Day make more Advances in the Affections
  of his Mistress, who sat near him, than he could have done in half a
  Year's Courtship.<br>
<br>
  '<i>Ovid</i> has finely touched this Method of making Love, which I shall
  here give my Reader in Mr. <i>Dryden's</i> Translation.<br>
<br>
(Page the Eleventh.)

<blockquote><i>Thus Love in Theatres did first improve,<br>
And Theatres are still the Scene of Love:<br>
Nor shun the Chariots, and the Coursers Race;<br>
The Circus is no inconvenient Place.<br>
Nor Need is there of talking on the Hand,<br>
Nor Nods, nor Sighs, which Lovers understand;<br>
But boldly next the Fair your Seat provide,<br>
Close as you can to hers, and Side by Side:<br>
Pleas'd or unpleas'd, no Matter; crowding sit;<br>
For so the Laws of publick Shows permit.<br>
Then find Occasion to begin Discourse,<br>
Enquire whose Chariot this, and whose that Horse;<br>
To whatsoever Side she is inclin'd,<br>
Suit all your Inclinations to her Mind;<br>
Like what she likes, from thence your Court begin,<br>
And whom she favours, wish that he may win.</i></blockquote>

(Again, Page the Sixteenth.)

<blockquote><i>O when will come the Day, by Heav'n design'd,<br>
When thou, the best and fairest of Mankind,<br>
Drawn by white Horses, shall in Triumph ride,<br>
With conquer'd Slaves attending on thy Side;<br>
Slaves, that no longer can be safe in flight,<br>
O glorious Object! O surprizing Sight! <br>
O Day of publick Joy, too good to end in Night!<br>
On such a Day, if thou, and next to thee<br>
Some Beauty sits, the Spectacle to see;<br>
If she enquire the Names of conquer'd Kings,<br>
Of Mountains, Rivers, and their hidden Springs;<br>
Answer to all thou knowest; and, if Need be,<br>
Of Things unknown seem to speak knowingly:<br>
This is</i> Euphrates, <i>crown'd with Reeds; and there<br>
Flows the swift</i> Tigris, <i>with his Sea-green hair,<br>
Invent new Names of Things unknown before;<br>
Call this</i> Armenia, <i>that, the</i> Caspian <i>Shore:<br>
Call this a</i> Mede, <i>and that a</i> Parthian <i>Youth;<br>
Talk probably; no Matter for the Truth.</i></blockquote>

The De<b>Sir</b> e of knowing future Events is one of the strongest Inclinations
in the Mind of Man. Indeed an Ability of foreseeing probable Accidents
is what, in the Language of Men, is called Wisdom and Prudence: But, not
satisfied with the Light that Reason holds out, Mankind hath endeavoured
to penetrate more compendiously into Futurity. Magick, Oracles, Omens,
lucky Hours, and the various Arts of Superstition, owe their Rise to
this powerful Cause. As this Principle is founded in Self-Love, every
Man is sure to be sollicitous in the first Place about his own Fortune,
the Course of his Life, and the Time and Manner of his Death.<br>
<br>
If we consider that we are free Agents, we shall discover the Absurdity
of Enquiries. One of our Actions, which we might have performed or
neglected, is the Cause of another that succeeds it, and so the whole
Chain of Life is link'd together. Pain, Poverty, or Infamy, are the
natural Product of vicious and imprudent Acts; as the contrary Blessings
are of good ones; so that we cannot suppose our Lot to be determined
without Impiety. A great Enhancement of Pleasure arises from its being
unexpected; and Pain is doubled by being foreseen. Upon all these, and
several other Accounts, we ought to rest satisfied in this Portion
bestowed on us; to adore the Hand that hath fitted every Thing to our
Nature, and hath not more display'd his Goodness in our Knowledge than
in our Ignorance.<br>
<br>
It is not unworthy Observation, that superstitious Enquiries into future
Events prevail more or less, in proportion to the Improvement of liberal
Arts and useful Knowledge in the several Parts of the World. Accordingly
we find, that magical Incantations remain in <i>Lapland</i>, in the more
remote Parts of <i>Scotland</i> they have their second Sight, and several of
our own Countrymen see abundance of Fairies. In <i>Asia</i> this Credulity is
strong; and the greatest Part of refined Learning there consists in the
Knowledge of Amulets, Talismans, occult Numbers, and the like.<br>
<br>
While I was at <i>Grand Cairo</i>, I fell into the Acquaintance of a
good-natured Mussulman, who promised me many good Offices, which he
designed to do me when he became the Prime Minister, which was a Fortune
bestowed on his Imagination by a Doctor very deep in the curious
Sciences. At his repeated Sollicitations I went to learn my Destiny of
this wonderful Sage. For a small Sum I had his Promise, but was requir'd
to wait in a dark Apartment till he had run thro' the preparatory
Ceremonies. Having a strong Propensity, even then, to Dreaming, I took a
Nap upon the Sofa where I was placed, and had the following Vision, the
Particulars whereof I picked up the other Day among my Papers.<br>
<br>
I found my self in an unbounded Plain, where methought the whole World,
in several Habits and with different Tongues, was assembled. The
Multitude glided swiftly along, and I found in my self a strong
Inclination to mingle in the Train. My Eyes quickly singled out some of
the most splendid Figures. Several in rich Caftans and glittering
Turbans bustled through the Throng, and trampled over the Bodies of
those they threw down; till to my great Surprize I found that the great
Pace they went only hastened them to a Scaffold or a Bowstring. Many
beautiful Damsels on the other Side moved forward with great Gaiety;
some danced till they fell all along; and others painted their Faces
till they lost their Noses. A Tribe of Creatures with busie Looks
falling into a Fit of Laughter at the Misfortunes of the unhappy Ladies,
I turn'd my Eyes upon them. They were each of them filling his Pockets
with Gold and Jewels, and when there was no Room left for more, these
Wretches looking round with Fear and Horror, pined away before my Face
with Famine and Discontent.<br>
<br>
This Prospect of human Misery struck me dumb for some Miles. Then it was
that, to disburthen my Mind, I took Pen and Ink, and did every Thing
that hath since happen'd under my Office of SPECTATOR. While I was
employing my self for the Good of Mankind, I was surpriz'd to meet with
very unsuitable Returns from my Fellow-Creatures. Never was poor Author
so beset with Pamphleteers, who sometimes marched directly against me,
but oftner shot at me from strong Bulwarks, or rose up suddenly in
Ambush. They were of all Characters and Capacities, some with Ensigns of
Dignity, and others in Liveries; but what most surpriz'd me, was to see
two or three in black Gowns among my Enemies. It was no small Trouble to
me, sometimes to have a Man come up to me with an angry Face, and
reproach me for having lampooned him, when I had never seen or heard of
him in my Life. With the Ladies it was otherwise: Many became my Enemies
for not being particularly pointed out; as there were others who
resented the Satyr which they imagined I had directed against them. My
great Comfort was in the Company of half a Dozen Friends, who, I found
since, were the Club which I have so often mentioned in my Papers. I
laughed often at <i><b>Sir</b>  Roger </i>in my Sleep, and was the more diverted with
<i>Will Honeycomb</i>'s Gallantries, (when we afterwards became acquainted)
because I had foreseen his Marriage with a Farmer's Daughter. The Regret
which arose in my Mind upon the Death of my Companions, my Anxieties for
the Publick, and the many Calamities still fleeting before my Eyes, made
me repent my Curiosity; when the Magician entered the Room, and awakened
me, by telling me (when it was too late) that he was just going to
begin.<br>
<br>
<i>N. B. </i>I have only deliver'd the Prophecy of that Part of my Life which
is past, it being inconvenient to divulge the second Part 'till a more
proper Opportunity.<br>

Having perused the following Letter, and finding it to run upon the
Subject of Love, I referred it to the Learned <i>Casuist</i>, whom I have
retained in my Service for Speculations of that Kind. He return'd it to
me the next Morning with his Report annexed to it, with both of which I

  '<a name="fr6051">Finding</a> that you have Entertained an useful Person in your Service in
  quality of <i>Love-Casuist</i><a href="#f6051"><sup>1</sup></a>, I apply my self to you, under a very
  great Difficulty, that hath for some Months perplexed me. I have a
  Couple of humble Servants, one of which I have no Aversion to; the
  other I think of very kindly. The first hath the Reputation of a Man
  of good Sense, and is one of those People that your Sex are apt to
  Value. My Spark is reckoned a Coxcomb among the Men, but is a
  Favourite of the Ladies. If I marry the Man of Worth, as they call
  him, I shall oblige my Parents and improve my Fortune; but with my
  dear Beau I promise my self Happiness, altho' not a Jointure. Now I
  would ask you, whether I should consent to lead my Life with a Man
  that I have only no Objection to, or with him against whom all
  Objections to me appear frivolous. I am determined to follow the
  <i>Casuist's</i> Advice, and I dare say he will not put me upon so serious
  a thing as Matrimony, contrary to my Inclination.'<br>

  not in the Right. About half an Hour ago, he maintained to my Face,
  that a Patch always implies a Pimple.'</blockquote><br>

As I look upon it to be my Duty rather to side with the Parents than the
Daughter, I shall propose some Considerations to my Gentle Querist,
which may encline her to comply with those, under whose Direction she
is: And at the same time, convince her, that it is not impossible but
she may, in time, have a true Affection for him who is, at present,
indifferent to her: Or, to use the old Family Maxim, that <i>If she
marries first, Love will come after.</i><br>
<br>
The only Objection, that she seems to insinuate against the Gentleman
proposed to her, is his want of Complaisance, which, I perceive, she is
very willing to return. Now, I can discover from this very Circumstance,
that she and her Lover, whatever they may think of it, are very good
Friends in their Hearts. It is difficult to determine, whether Love
delights more in giving Pleasure or Pain. Let Miss <i>Fickle</i> ask her own
Heart, if she doth not take a Secret Pride in making this Man of good
Sense look very silly. Hath she ever been better pleas'd, than when her
Behaviour hath made her Lover ready to hang himself? Or doth she ever
rejoice more, than when she thinks she hath driven him to the very Brink
of a purling Stream? Let her consider, at the same time, that it is not
impossible but her Lover may have discovered her Tricks, and hath a Mind
to give her as good as she brings. I remember a handsome young Baggage
that treated a hopeful <i>Greek</i> of my Acquaintance, just come from
<i>Oxford</i>, as if he had been a <i>Barbarian.</i> The first Week, after she had
fixed him, she took a Pinch of Snuff out of his Rival's Box, and
apparently touched the Enemy's little Finger. She became a profest Enemy
to the Arts and Sciences, and scarce ever wrote a Letter to him without
wilfully mis-spelling his Name. The young Scholar, to be even with her,
railed at <i>Coquettes</i> as soon as he had got the Word; and did not want
Parts to turn into Ridicule her Men of Wit and Pleasure of the Town.
After having irritated one another for the Space of five Months, she
made an Assignation with him fourscore Miles from <i>London.</i> But as he
was very well acquainted with her Pranks, he took a Journey the quite
contrary Way. Accordingly they met, quarrell'd, and in a few Days were
Married. Their former Hostilities are now the Subject of their Mirth,
being content at present with that Part of Love only which bestows
Pleasure.<br>
<br>
Women, who have been married some time, not having it in their Heads to
draw after them a numerous Train of Followers, find their Satisfaction
in the Possession of one Man's Heart. I know very well, that Ladies in
their Bloom de<b>Sir</b> e to be excused in this Particular. But when Time hath
worn out their natural Vanity and taught them Discretion, their Fondness
settles on its proper Object. And it is probably for this Reason, that
among Husbands, you will find more that are fond of Women beyond their
Prime, than of those who are actually in the Insolence of Beauty. My
Reader will apply the same Observation to the other Sex.<br>
<br>
I need not insist upon the Necessity of their pursuing one common
Interest, and their united Care, for their Children; but shall only
observe, by the Way, that married Persons are both more warm in their
Love, and more hearty in their Hatred, than any others whatsoever.
Mutual Favours and Obligations, which may be supposed to be greater here
than in any other State, naturally beget an Intense Affection in
generous Minds. As, on the contrary, Persons who have bestowed such
Favours, have a particular Bitterness in their Resentments, when they
think themselves ill treated by those of whom they have deserved so
much.<br>
<br>
Besides, Miss <i>Fickle</i> may consider, that as there are often many Faults
conceal'd before Marriage, so there are sometimes many Virtues
unobserv'd.<br>
<br>
To this we may add the great Efficacy of Custom, and constant
Conversation, to produce a mutual Friendship and Benevolence in two
Persons. It is a nice Reflection, which I have heard a Friend of mine
make, that you may be sure a Woman loves a Man, when she uses his
Expressions, tells his Stories, or imitates his Manner. This gives a
secret Delight; for Imitation is a kind of artless Flattery, and
mightily favours the powerful Principle of Self-love. It is certain,
that married Persons, who are possest with a mutual Esteem, not only
catch the Air and way of Talk from one another, but fall into the same
Traces of thinking and liking. Nay, some have carried the Remark so far
as to assert, that the Features of Man and Wife grow, in time, to
resemble one another. Let my fair Correspondent therefore consider, that
the Gentleman recommended will have a good deal of her own Face in two
or three Years; which she must not expect from the Beau, who is too full
of his dear self to copy after another. And I dare appeal to her own
Judgment, if that Person will not be the handsomest, that is the most
like her self.<br>
<br>
We have a remarkable Instance to our present Purpose in the History of
King <i>Edgar</i>, which I shall here relate, and leave it with my fair
Correspondent to be applied to her self.<br>
<br>
This great Monarch, who is so famous in <i>British</i> Story, fell in Love,
as he made his Progress through his Kingdom, with a certain Duke's
Daughter who lived near <i>Winchester</i>, and was the most celebrated Beauty
of the Age. His Importunities and the Violence of his Passion were so
great, that the Mother of the young Lady promised him to bring her
Daughter to his Bed the next Night, though in her Heart she abhorr'd so
infamous an Office. It was no sooner dark than she convey'd into his
Room a young Maid of no disagreeable Figure, who was one of her
Attendants, and did not want Address to improve the Opportunity for the
Advancement of her Fortune. She made so good use of her Time, that when
she offered to rise a little before Day, the King could by no means
think of parting with her. So that finding herself under a Necessity of
discovering who she was, she did it in so handsome a Manner, that his
Majesty was exceeding gracious to her, and took her ever after under his
Protection; insomuch that our Chronicles tell us he carried her along
with him, made her his first Minister of State, and continued true to
her alone, 'till his Marriage with the beautiful <i>Elfrida.</i><br>

<br>
  <i>Mr.</i> SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'I have a couple of Nieces under my Direction, who so often run
  gadding abroad, that I don't know where to have them. Their Dress,
  their Tea, and their Visits take up all their Time, and they go to Bed
  as tired with doing nothing, as I am after quilting a whole
  Under-Petticoat. The only time they are not idle, is while they read
  your <b>Spectators</b>; which being dedicated to the Interests of Virtue, I
  de<b>Sir</b> e you to recommend the long neglected Art of Needle-work. Those
  Hours which in this Age are thrown away in Dress, Play, Visits, and
  the like, were employ'd, in my time, in writing out Receipts, or
  working Beds, Chairs, and Hangings for the Family. For my Part, I have
  ply'd my Needle these fifty Years, and by my good Will would never
  have it out of my Hand. It grieves my Heart to see a couple of proud
  idle Flirts sipping their Tea, for a whole Afternoon, in a Room hung
  round with the Industry of their Great Grandmother. Pray, <b>Sir</b> , take
  the laudable Mystery of Embroidery into your serious Consideration,
  and as you have a great deal of the Virtue of the last Age in you,
  continue your Endeavours to reform the present.'<br>
<br>
<i>  I am,</i> &amp;c.</blockquote><br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
In Obedience to the Commands of my venerable Correspondent, I have duly
weigh'd this important Subject, and promise my self, from the Arguments
here laid down, <a name="fr6061">that</a> all the fine Ladies of <i>England</i> will be ready, as
soon as their Mourning is over<a href="#f6061"><sup>1</sup></a>, to appear covered with the Work of
their own Hands.<br>
<br>
What a delightful Entertainment must it be to the Fair Sex, whom their
native Modesty, and the Tenderness of Men towards them, exempts from
Publick Business, to pass their Hours in imitating Fruits and Flowers,
and transplanting all the Beauties of Nature into their own Dress, or
raising a new Creation in their Closets and Apartments. How pleasing is
the Amusement of walking among the Shades and Groves planted by
themselves, in surveying Heroes slain by their Needle, or little Cupids
which they have brought into the World without Pain!<br>
<br>
This is, methinks, the most proper way wherein a Lady can shew a fine
Genius, and I cannot forbear wishing, that several Writers of that Sex
had chosen to apply themselves rather to Tapestry than Rhime. Your
Pastoral Poetesses may vent their Fancy in Rural Landskips, and place
despairing Shepherds under silken Willows, or drown them in a Stream of
Mohair. The Heroick Writers may work up Battles as successfully, and
inflame them with Gold or stain them with Crimson. Even those who have
only a Turn to a Song or an Epigram, may put many valuable Stitches into
a Purse, and crowd a thousand Graces into a Pair of Garters.<br>
<br>
If I may, without breach of good Manners, imagine that any pretty
Creature is void of Genius, and would perform her Part herein but very
awkardly, I must nevertheless insist upon her working, if it be only to
keep her out of Harm's way.<br>
<br>
Another Argument for busying good Women in Works of Fancy, is, because
it takes them off from Scandal, the usual Attendant of Tea-Tables, and
all other unactive Scenes of Life. While they are forming their Birds
and Beasts, their Neighbours will be allowed to be the Fathers of their
own Children: And <i>Whig</i> and <i>Tory</i> will be but seldom mentioned, where
the great Dispute is, whether Blue or Red is the more proper Colour. How
much greater Glory would <i>Sophronia</i> do the General, if she would chuse
rather to work the Battle of <i>Blenheim</i> in Tapestry, than signalize her
self with so much Vehemence against those who are <i>Frenchmen</i> in their
Hearts.<br>
<br>
A Third Reason that I shall mention, is the Profit that is brought to
the Family where these pretty Arts are encouraged. It is manifest that
this way of Life not only keeps fair Ladies from running out into
Expences, but is at the same time an actual Improvement. How memorable
would that Matron be, who should have it Inscribed upon her Monument,
'that she Wrought out the whole Bible in Tapestry, and died in a good
old Age, after having covered three hundred Yards of Wall in the
Mansion-House.'<br>
<br>
The Premises being consider'd, I humbly submit the following Proposals
to all Mothers in <i>Great Britain</i>.
<ol type="I"><li>
  That no young Virgin whatsoever be allow'd to receive the Addresses
  of her first Lover, but in a Suit of her own Embroidering.</li></ol><ol type="I" start="2"><li>

  That before every fresh Servant, she be oblig'd to appear with a
  new Stomacher at the least.</li></ol><ol type="I" start="3"><li>

  That no one be actually married, till she hath the Child-bed
  Pillows, &amp;c. ready Stitched, as likewise the Mantle for the Boy quite
  finished.</li></ol>

These Laws, if I mistake not, would effectually restore the decay'd Art
of Needle-work, and make the Virgins of <i>Great Britain</i> exceedingly
Nimble-finger'd in their Business.<br>
<br>
There is a memorable Custom of the <i>Grecian</i> Ladies in this particular,
preserv'd in <i>Homer</i>, which I hope will have a very good Effect with my
Country-women. A Widow in Ancient Times could not, without Indecency,
receive a second Husband, till she had Woven a Shrowd for her deceased
Lord, or the next of Kin to him. Accordingly, the Chaste <i>Penelope</i>
having, as she thought, lost <i>Ulysses</i> at Sea, she employed her time in
preparing a Winding-sheet for <i>Laertes</i>, the Father of her Husband. The
Story of her Web being very Famous, and yet not sufficiently known in
its several Circumstances, I shall give it to my Reader, as <i>Homer</i>
makes one of her Wooers relate it.

<blockquote><i>Sweet Hope she gave to every Youth apart,<br>
With well-taught Looks, and a deceitful Heart:<br>
A Web she wove of many a slender Twine,<br>
Of curious Texture, and perplext Design;<br>
My Youths, she cry'd, my Lord but newly dead,<br>
Forbear a while to court my widow'd Bed,<br>
'Till I have wov'n, as solemn Vows require,<br>
This Web, a Shrowd for poor</i> Ulysses' <i><b>Sir</b> e.<br>
His Limbs, when Fate the Hero's Soul demands,<br>
Shall claim this Labour of his Daughter's Hands:<br>
Lest all the Dames of Greece my Name despise,<br>
While the great King without a Covering lies.<br><br>

Thus she. Nor did my Friends mistrust the Guile.<br>
All Day she sped the long laborious Toil:<br>
But when the burning Lamps supply'd the Sun,<br>
Each Night unravell'd what the Day begun.<br>
Three live-long Summers did the Fraud prevail.<br>
The Fourth her Maidens told th' amazing Tale.<br>
These Eyes beheld, as close I took my Stand,<br>
The backward Labours of her faithless Hand:<br>
'Till watch'd at length, and press'd on every Side,<br>
Her Task she ended, and commenc'd a Bride.</i></blockquote><br>

  Decidit in casses pr&aelig;da petita meos.</i><br>
<br>
Ovid.<a href="transindex.html#607t"><img src="images/qmark.png" width="15" height="15" align="right" alt="translation"></a><br>

<br>
  <i>Mr.</i> SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'Having in your Paper of <i>Monday</i> last published my Report on the
  Case of Mrs.<i> Fanny Fickle</i>, wherein I have taken Notice, that Love
  comes after Marriage; I hope your Readers are satisfied of this Truth,
  that as Love generally produces Matrimony, so it often happens that
  Matrimony produces Love.<br>
<br>
  'It perhaps requires more Virtues to make a good Husband or Wife, than
  what go the finishing any the most shining Character whatsoever.<br>
<br>
  'Discretion seems absolutely necessary, and accordingly we find that
  the best Husbands have been most famous for their Wisdom. <i>Homer</i>, who
  hath drawn a perfect Pattern of a prudent Man, to make it the more
  compleat, hath celebrated him for the just Returns of Fidelity and
  Truth to his <i>Penelope</i>; insomuch that he refused the Caresses of a
  Goddess for her sake, and to use the Expression of the best of Pagan
  Authors, <i>vetulam suam pr&aelig;tulit Immortalitati</i>, his old Woman was
  dearer to him than Immortality.<br>
<br>
  'Virtue is the next necessary Qualification for this domestick
  Character, as it naturally produces Constancy and mutual Esteem. Thus
  <i>Brutus</i> and <i>Porcia</i> were more remarkable for Virtue and Affection
  than any others of the Age in which they lived.<br>
<br>
  'Good-Nature is a third necessary Ingredient in the Marriage-State,
  without which it would inevitably sower upon a thousand Occasions.
  When Greatness of Mind is joined with this amiable Quality, it
  attracts the Admiration and Esteem of all who behold it. Thus <i>C&aelig;sar</i>,
  not more remarkable for his Fortune and Valour than for his Humanity,
  stole into the Hearts of the <i>Roman</i> People, when breaking through the
  Custom, he pronounced an Oration at the Funeral of his first and best
  beloved Wife.<br>
<br>
  'Good-Nature is insufficient, unless it be steady and uniform, and
  accompanied with an Evenness of Temper, which is, above all things, to
  be preserved in this Friendship contracted for Life. A Man must be
  easie within himself, before he can be so to his other self.
  <i>Socrates</i>, and <i>Marcus Aurelius</i>, are Instances of Men, who, by the
  Strength of Philosophy, having entirely composed their Minds, and
  subdued their Passions, are celebrated for good Husbands,
  notwithstanding the first was yoked with <i>Xantippe</i>, and the other
  with <i>Faustina.</i> If the wedded Pair would but habituate themselves for
  the first Year to bear with one another's Faults, the Difficulty would
  be pretty well conquer'd. This mutual Sweetness of Temper and
  Complacency, was finely recommended in the Nuptial Ceremonies among
  the Heathens, who, when they sacrificed to <i>Juno</i> at that Solemnity,
  always tore out the Gaul from the Entrails of the Victim, and cast it
  behind the Altar.<br>
<br>
  'I shall conclude this Letter with a Passage out of Dr. <i>Plot's
  Natural History of Staffordshire</i>, not only as it will serve to fill
  up your present Paper; but if I find my self in the Humour, may give
  Rise to another; I having by me an old Register, belonging to the
  Place here under-mentioned.'

<blockquote>    <b>Sir</b>  <i>Philip de Somervile</i> held the Manors of <i>Whichenovre,
    Scirescot, Ridware, Netherton</i>, and <i>Cowlee</i>, all in <i>Com.
    Stafford</i>, of the Earls of <i>Lancaster</i>, by this memorable Service.
    The said <b>Sir</b>  <i>Philip</i> shall find, maintain, and sustain, one <i>Bacon
    Flitch,</i> hanging in his Hall at <i>Whichenovre</i> ready arrayed all
    times of the Year, but in <i>Lent</i>, to be given to every Man or Woman
    married, after the Day and the Year of their Marriage be past, in
    Form following.<br>
<br>
    Whensoever that any one such before named will come to enquire for
    the Bacon, in their own Person, they shall come to the Bailiff, or
    to the Porter of the Lordship of <i>Whichenovre</i>, and shall say to
    them in the manner as ensueth;<br>
<br>
    'Bayliff, or Porter, I doo you to know, that I am come for my self,
    to demand one <i>Bacon Flyke</i> hanging in the Hall of the Lord of
    <i>Whichenovre</i>, after the Form thereunto belonging.'<br>
<br>
    After which Relation, the Bayliff or Porter shall assign a Day to
    him, upon Promise by his Faith to return, and with him to bring
    Twain of his Neighbours. And in the mean Time the said Bailiff shall
    take with him Twain of the Freeholders of the Lordship of
    <i>Whichenovre</i>, and they three shall go to the Manor of <i>Rudlow</i>,
    belonging to <i>Robert Knightleye</i>, and there shall summon the
    aforesaid <i>Knightleye</i>, or his Bayliff, commanding him to be ready
    at <i>Whichenovre</i> the Day appointed, at Prime of Day, with his
    Carriage, that is to say, a Horse and a Saddle, a Sack and a Pryke,
    for to convey the said Bacon and Corn a Journey out of the County of
    <i>Stafford</i>, at his Costages. And then the said Bailiff shall, with
    the said Freeholders, summon all the Tenants of the said Manor, to
    be ready at the Day appointed, at <i>Whichenovre</i>, for to do and
    perform the Services which they owe to the Bacon. And at the Day
    assigned, all such as owe Services to the Bacon, shall be ready at
    the Gate of the Manor of <i>Whichenovre</i>, from the Sun-rising to Noon,
    attending and awaiting for the coming of him who fetcheth the Bacon.
    And when he is come, there shall be delivered to him and his
    Fellows, Chapelets; and to all those which shall be there, to do
    their Services due to the Bacon. And they shall lead the said
    Demandant with Trumps and Tabours, and other manner of Minstrels to
    the Hall-Door, where he shall find the Lord of <i>Whichenovre</i>, or his
    Steward, ready to deliver the Bacon in this Manner.<br>
<br>
    He shall enquire of him, which demandeth the Bacon, if he have
    brought twain of his Neighbours with him: Which must answer, <i>They
    be here ready</i>. And then the Steward shall cause these two
    Neighbours to swear, if the said Demandant be a wedded Man, or have
    been a Man wedded; and if since his Marriage one Year and a Day be
    past; and if he be a Free-man, or a Villain. And if his said
    Neighbours make Oath, that he hath for him all these three Points
    rehearsed; then shall the Bacon be taken down and brought to the
    Hall-Door, and shall there be laid upon one half Quarter of Wheat,
    and upon one other of Rye. And he that demandeth the Bacon shall
    kneel upon his Knee, and shall hold his right Hand upon a Book,
    which Book shall be laid upon the Bacon and the Corn, and shall make
    Oath in this manner.<br>
<br>
    'Here ye, <b>Sir</b>  <i>Philip</i> de <i>Somervile</i>, Lord of <i>Whichenovre</i>,
    mayntener and gyver of this Baconne: That I <i>A</i> sithe I Wedded <i>B</i>
    my Wife, and sithe I had hyr in my kepyng, and at my Wylle, by a
    Year and a Day after our Marriage, I would not have chaunged for
    none other; farer ne fowler; richer, ne pourer; ne for none other
    descended of greater Lynage; slepyng ne wakyng, at noo tyme. And if
    the seyd <i>B</i> were sole and I sole I would take her to be my Wife
    before all the Wymen of the Worlde, of what condiciones soever they
    be: good or evylle, as help me God ond his Seyntes, and this Flesh
    and all Fleshes.'<br>
<br>
    And his Neighbours shall make Oath, that they trust verily he hath
    said truly. And if it be found by his Neighbours before-named that
    he be a Free-man, there shall be delivered to him half a Quarter of
    Wheat and a Cheese; and if he be a Villain, he shall have half a
    Quarter of Rye without Cheese. And then shall <i>Knightleye</i> the Lord
    of <i>Rudlow</i> be called for, to carry all these Things tofore
    rehearsed; and the said Corn shall be laid on one Horse and the
    Bacon above it: and he to whom the Bacon appertaineth shall ascend
    upon his Horse; and shall take the Cheese before him if he have a
    Horse. And if he have none, the Lord of <i>Whichenovre</i> shall cause
    him to have one Horse and Saddle, to such time as he be past his
    Lordship: and so shall they depart the Manor of <i>Whichenovre</i> with
    the Corn and the Bacon, tofore him that hath won it, with Trumpets,
    Tabourets, and other manner of Minstrelsie. And all the Free Tenants
    of <i>Whichenovre</i> shall Conduct him to be passed the Lordship of
    <i>Whichenovre.</i> And then shall they all return; except him, to whom
    appertained to make the Carriage and Journey without the County of
    <i>Stafford</i>, at the Costs of his Lord of <i>Whichenovre.</i></blockquote></blockquote><br>

  <i>Mr.</i> SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'According to my Promise, I herewith transmit to you a List of several
  Persons, who from time to time demanded the <i>Flitch of Bacon</i> of <b>Sir</b> 
  <i>Philip de Somervile</i> and his Descendants; as it is preserved in an
  ancient Manuscript under the Title of <i>The Register of
  Whichenovre-Hall, and of the Bacon Flitch there maintained.</i><br>
<br>
  'In the Beginning of this Record is recited the Law or Institution in
  Form, as it is already printed in your <a href="#section607">last Paper</a>: To which are added
  Two By-Laws, as a Comment upon the General Law, the Substance whereof
  is, that the Wife shall take the same Oath as the Husband, <i>mutatis
  mutandis</i>; and that the Judges shall, as they think meet, interrogate
  or cross-examine the Witnesses. After this proceeds the Register in
  Manner following.<br>
<br>
  'Aubry de Falstaff, <i>Son of <b>Sir</b> </i> John Falstaff, <i>Kt. with Dame</i> Maude
  <i>his Wife, were the first that demanded the Bacon, he having bribed
  twain of his Father's Companions to swear falsly in his Behoof whereby
  he gained the Flitch: But he and his said Wife falling immediately
  into a Dispute how the said Bacon should be dressed, it was by Order
  of the Judges taken from him, and hung up again in the Hall.</i><br>
<br>
  'Alison <i>the Wife of</i> Stephen Freckle, <i>brought her said Husband along
  with her, and set forth the good Conditions and Behaviour of her
  Consort, adding withal that she doubted not but he was ready to attest
  the like of her, his Wife; whereupon he, the said</i> Stephen,<i> shaking
  his Head, she turned short upon him, and gave him a Box on the Ear</i>.<br>
<br>
  'Philip de Waverland, <i>having laid his Hand upon the Book, when the
  Clause</i>, Were I sole and she sole, <i>was rehearsed, found a secret
  Compunction rising in his Mind, and stole it off again</i>.
<br><br>

  'Richard de Loveless, <i>who was a Courtier, and a very wellbred Man,
  being observed to hesitate at the Words</i> after our Marriage, <i>was
  thereupon required to explain himself. He reply'd, by talking very
  largely of his exact Complaisance while he was a Lover; and alledg'd,
  that he had not in the least disobliged his Wife for a Year and a Day</i>
  before Marriage, <i>which he hoped was the same Thing</i>.<br>
<br>
  'Rejected.<br>
<br>
  'Joceline Jolly, Esq., <i>making it appear by unquestionable Testimony,
  That he and his Wife had presented full and entire Affection for the
  Space of the first Month, commonly called the</i> Honey-Moon; <i>he had in
  Consideration thereof one Rasher bestowed upon him.</i><br>
<br>
  'After this, says the Record, many Years passed over before any
  Demandant appeared at <i>Whichenovre-Hall</i>; insomuch that one would have
  thought that the whole Country were turned <i>Jews</i>, so little was their
  Affection to the Flitch of Bacon.<br>
<br>
  'The next Couple enrolled had like to have carried it, if one of the
  Witnesses had not deposed, That dining on a <i>Sunday</i> with the
  Demandant, whose Wife had sate below the Squire's Lady at Church, she
  the said Wife dropped some Expressions, as if she thought her Husband
  deserved to be knighted; to which he returned a passionate <i>Pish</i>! The
  Judges taking the Premises into Consideration, declared the aforesaid
  Behaviour to imply an unwarrantable Ambition in the Wife, and Anger in
  the Husband.<br>
<br>
  'It is recorded as a sufficient Disqualification of a certain Wife,
  that speaking of her Husband, she said, <i>God forgive him</i>.<br>
<br>
  'It is likewise remarkable, that a Couple were rejected upon the
  Deposition of one of their Neighbours, that the Lady had once told her
  Husband, that <i>it was her Duty to obey</i>; to which he replied, <i>Oh! my
  Dear, you are never in the wrong.</i><br>
<br>
  'The violent Passion of one Lady for her Lap-Dog; the turning away of
  the old House-Maid by another; a Tavern-Bill torn by the Wife, and a
  Taylor's by the Husband; a Quarrel about the Kissing-Crust; spoiling
  of Dinners, and coming in late of Nights; are so many several Articles
  which occasioned the Reprobation of some Scores of Demandants, whose
  Names are recorded in the aforesaid Register.<br>
<br>
  'Without enumerating other particular Persons, I shall content my self
  with observing, that the Sentence pronounced against one <i>Gervase
  Poacher</i> is, that <i>he might have had Bacon to his Eggs, if he had not
  heretofore scolded his Wife when they were over boiled</i>. And the
  Deposition against <i>Dorothy Dolittle</i> runs in these Words; <i>That she
  had so far usuped the Dominion of the Coalfire, (the Stirring whereof
  her Husband claimed to himself) that by her good Will she never would
  suffer the Poker out of her Hand.</i><br>
<br>
  'I find but two Couples, in this first Century, that were successful:
  The first, was a Sea-Captain and his Wife, who since the Day of their
  Marriage, had not seen one another till the Day of the Claim. The
  Second, was an honest Pair in the Neighbourhood; The Husband was a Man
  of plain good Sense, and a peaceable Temper; the Woman was dumb.'</blockquote><br>

  <i>Mr.</i> SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'I <a name="fr6091">have</a> for some Time de<b>Sir</b> ed to appear in your Paper, and have
  therefore chosen a Day<a href="#f6091"><sup>1</sup></a> to steal into the SPECTATOR, when I take it
  for granted you will not have many spare Minutes for Speculations of
  your own. As I was the other Day walking with an honest
  Country-Gentleman, he very often was expressing his Astonishment to
  see the Town so mightily crowded with Doctors of Divinity: Upon which
  I told him he was very much mistaken if he took all those Gentlemen he
  saw in Scarfs to be Persons of that Dignity; for, that a young Divine,
  after his first Degree in the University, usually comes hither only to
  show himself; and on that Occasion is apt to think he is but half
  equipp'd with a Gown and Cassock for his publick Appearance, if he
  hath not the additional Ornament of a Scarf of the first Magnitude to
  intitle him to the Appellation of Doctor from his Landlady and the Boy
  at <i>Childs.</i> Now since I know that this Piece of Garniture is looked
  upon as a Mark of Vanity or Affectation, as it is made use of among
  some of the little spruce Adventurers of the Town, I should be glad if
  you would give it a Place among those Extravagancies you have justly
  exposed in several of your Papers: being very well assured that the
  main Body of the Clergy, both in the Country and the Universities, who
  are almost to a Man untainted with it, would be very well pleased to
  see this Venerable Foppery well exposed. When my Patron did me the
  Honour to take me into his Family, (for I must own my self of this
  Order) he was pleased to say he took me as a Friend and Companion; and
  whether he looked upon the Scarf like the Lace and Shoulder-knot of a
  Footman, as a Badge of Servitude and Dependance, I do not know, but he
  was so kind as to leave my wearing of it to my own Discretion; and not
  having any just Title to it from my Degrees, I am content to be
  without the Ornament. The Privileges of our Nobility to keep a certain
  Number of Chaplains are undisputed, though perhaps not one in ten of
  those reverend Gentlemen have any Relation to the noble Families their
  Scarfs belong to; the Right generally of creating all Chaplains except
  the Domestick, where there is one, being nothing more than the
  Perquisite of a Steward's Place, who, if he happens to out-live any
  considerable Number of his noble Masters, shall probably, at one and
  the same Time, have fifty Chaplains, all in their proper
  Accoutrements, of his own Creation; though perhaps there hath been
  neither Grace nor Prayer said in the Family since the Introduction of
  the first Coronet.'<br>

  'I wish you would write a Philosophical Paper about Natural
  Antipathies, with a Word or two concerning the Strength of
  Imagination. I can give you a List upon the first Notice, of a
  Rational <i>China</i> Cup, of an Egg that walks upon two Legs, and a Quart
  Pot that sings like a Nightingale. There is in my Neighbourhood a very
  pretty prattling Shoulder of Veal, that squawls out at the Sight of a
  Knife. Then as for Natural Antipathies, I know a General Officer who
  was never conquered but by a smother'd Rabbit; and a Wife that
  domineers over her Husband by the Help of a Breast of Mutton. A Story
  that relates to my self on this Subject may be thought not
  unentertaining, especially when I assure you that it is literally
  true. I had long made Love to a Lady, in the Possession of whom I am
  now the happiest of Mankind, whose Hand I shou'd have gained with much
  Difficulty without the Assistance of a Cat. You must know then, that
  my most dangerous Rival had so strong an Aversion to this Species,
  that he infallibly swooned away at the Sight of that harmless
  Creature. My Friend Mrs. <i>Lucy</i>, her Maid, having a greater Respect
  for me and my Purse than she had for my Rival, always took Care to pin
  the Tail of a Cat under the Gown of her Mistress, whenever she knew of
  his coming; which had such an Effect, that every Time he entred the
  Room, he looked more like one of the Figures in Mrs. <i>Salmon's</i>
  Wax-work, than a de<b>Sir</b> able Lover. In short, he grew Sick of her
  Company; which the young Lady taking Notice of, (who no more knew why,
  than he did) she sent me a Challenge to meet her in <i>Lincoln's-Inn</i>
  Chappel, which I joyfully accepted, and have (amongst other Pleasures)
  the Satisfaction of being praised by her for my Stratagem, I am, &amp;c.'<br>

I have often wondered that the <i>Jews</i> should contrive such a worthless
Greatness for the Deliverer whom they expected, as to dress him up in
external Pomp and Pageantry, and represent him to their Imagination, as
making Havock amongst his Creatures, and acted with the poor Ambition of
a <i>C&aelig;sar</i> or an <i>Alexander</i>. How much more illustrious doth he appear in
his real Character, when considered as the Author of universal
Benevolence among Men, as refining our Passions, exalting our Nature,
giving us vast Ideas of Immortality, and teaching us a Contempt of that
little showy Grandeur, wherein the <i>Jews</i> made the Glory of their
Messiah to consist!<br>
<br>
<i>Nothing</i> (says <i>Longinus</i>) <i>can be Great, the Contempt of which is
Great</i>. The Possession of Wealth and Riches cannot give a Man a Title to
Greatness, because it is looked upon as a Greatness of Mind, to contemn
these Gifts of Fortune, and to be above the De<b>Sir</b> e of them. I have
therefore been inclined to think, that there are greater Men who lie
concealed among the Species, than those who come out, and draw upon
themselves the Eyes and Admiration of Mankind. <i>Virgil</i> would never have
been heard of, had not his Domestick Misfortunes driven him out of his
Obscurity, and brought him to <i>Rome</i>.<br>
<br>
If we suppose that there are Spirits or Angels who look into the Ways of
Men, as it is highly probable there are, both from Reason and
Revelation; how different are the Notions which they entertain of us,
from those which we are apt to form of one another? Were they to give us
in their Catalogue of such Worthies as are now living, how different
would it be from that, which any of our own Species would draw up?<br>
<br>
We are dazled with the Splendour of Titles, the Ostentation of Learning,
the Noise of Victories; They, on the contrary, see the Philosopher in
the Cottage, who possesses his Soul in Patience and Thankfulness, under
the Pressure of what little Minds call Poverty and Distress. They do not
look for great Men at the Head of Armies, or among the Pomps of a Court,
but often find them out in Shades and Solitudes, in the private Walks
and By-paths of Life. The Evening's Walk of a wise Man is more
illustrious in their Sight, than the March of a General at the Head of a
hundred thousand Men. A Contemplation of God's Works; a voluntary Act of
Justice to our own Detriment; a generous Concern for the Good of
Mankind; Tears that are shed in Silence for the Misery of others; a
private De<b>Sir</b> e or Resentment broken and subdued; in short, an unfeigned
Exercise of Humility, or any other Virtue; are such Actions as are
glorious in their Sight, and denominate Men great and reputable. The
most famous among us are often looked upon with Pity, with Contempt, or
with Indignation; while those who are most obscure among their own
Species, are regarded with Love, with Approbation and Esteem.<br>
<br>
The Moral of the present Speculation amounts to this, That we should not
be led away by the Censures and Applauses of Men, but consider the
Figure that every Person will make, at that Time when Wisdom shall be
justified of her Children, and nothing pass for Great or Illustrious,
which is not an Ornament and Perfection to humane Nature.<br>
<br>
The Story of <i>Gyges</i> the rich <i>Lydian</i> Monarch, is a memorable Instance
to our present Purpose. The Oracle being asked by <i>Gyges</i>, who was the
happiest Man, replied <i>Agla&uuml;s</i>. <i>Gyges</i>, who expected to have heard
himself named on this Occasion, was much surprized, and very curious to
know who this <i>Agla&uuml;s</i> should be. After much Enquiry he was found to be
an obscure Countryman, who employ'd all his Time in cultivating a
Garden, and a few Acres of Land about his House.<br>
<br>
<i>Cowley's</i> agreeable Relation of this Story shall close this Day's
Speculation.

<blockquote><i>Thus</i> Agla&uuml;s <i>(a Man unknown to Men,<br>
But the Gods knew, and therefore lov'd him then)<br>
Thus liv'd obscurely then without a Name,</i><br>
Agla&uuml;s, <i>now consign'd t' eternal Fame.<br>
For </i>Gyges, <i>the rich King, wicked and great,<br>
Presum'd at wise</i> Apollo's Delphick<i> Seat,<br>
Presum'd to ask, Oh thou, the whole World's Eye,<br>
See'st thou a Man that happier is than I?<br>
The God, who scorned to flatter Man, reply'd,</i><br>
Agla&uuml;s <i>happier is. But </i>Gyges<i> cry'd,<br>
In a proud Rage, Who can that</i> Agla&uuml;s<i> be?<br>
We've heard as yet of no such King as he.<br>
And true it was, through the whole Earth around,<br>
No King of such a Name was to be found.<br>
Is some old </i>Hero<i> of that Name alive,<br>
Who his high Race does from the Gods derive?<br>
Is it some mighty Gen'ral, that has done<br>
Wonders in Fight, and God-like Honours won?<br>
Is it some Man of endless Wealth? said he:<br>
None, none of these; who can this</i> Agla&uuml;s <i>be?<br>
After long Search, and vain Enquiries past,<br>
In an obscure</i> Arcadian <i>Vale at last,<br>
(Th'</i> Arcadian <i>Life has always shady been)<br>

This</i> Agla&uuml;s, <i>who Monarchs Envy drew,<br>
Whose Happiness the Gods stood Witness to,<br>
This mighty</i> Agla&uuml;s <i>was lab'ring found,<br>
With his own Hands, in his own little Ground.<br><br>

So, gracious God, (if it may lawful be,<br>
Among those foolish Gods to mention thee)<br>
So let me act, on such a private Stage,<br>
The last dull Scenes of my declining Age;<br>
After long Toils and Voyages in vain,<br>
This quiet Port let my toss'd Vessel gain;<br>
Of heav'nly Rest, this Earnest to me lend,<br>

I am willing to postpone every thing, to do any the least Service for
the Deserving and Unfortunate. Accordingly I have caused the following
Letter to be inserted in my Paper the Moment that it came to my Hands,
without altering one Tittle in an Account which the Lady relates so
handsomely her self.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote><i>Mr.</i> SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'I flatter my self, you will not only pity, but, if possible, redress
  a Misfortune my self and several others of my Sex lie under. I hope
  you will not be offended, nor think I mean by this to justifie my own
  imprudent Conduct, or expect You should. No! I am sensible how
  severely, in some of your former Papers, you have reproved Persons
  guilty of the like Mismanagements. I was scarce Sixteen, and, I may
  say without Vanity, Handsome, when courted by a false perjured Man;
  who, upon Promise of Marriage, rendered me the most unhappy of Women.
  After he had deluded me from my Parents, who were People of very good
  Fashion, in less than three Months he left me. My Parents would not
  see, nor hear from me; and had it not been for a Servant, who had
  lived in our Family, I must certainly have perished for want of Bread.
  However, it pleased Providence, in a very short time, to alter my
  miserable Condition. A Gentleman saw me, liked me, and married me. My
  Parents were reconciled; and I might be as happy in the Change of my
  Condition, as I was before miserable, but for some things, that you
  shall know, which are insupportable to me; and I am sure you have so
  much Honour and Compassion as to let those Persons know, in some of
  your Papers, how much they are in the wrong. I have been married near
  five Years, and do not know that in all that time I ever went abroad
  without my Husband's Leave and Approbation. I am obliged, through the
  Importunities  of several of my Relations, to go abroad oftner than
  suits my Temper. Then it is, I labour under insupportable Agonies.
  That Man, or rather Monster, haunts every Place I go to. Base Villain!
  By reason I will not admit his nauseous wicked Visits and
  Appointments, he strives all the ways he can to ruin me. He left me
  destitute of Friend or Money, nor ever thought me worth enquiring
  after, till he unfortunately happened to see me in a Front Box,
  sparkling with Jewels. Then his Passion returned. Then the Hypocrite
  pretended to be a Penitent. Then he practised all those Arts that
  helped before to undo me. I am not to be deceived a second time by
  him. I hate and abhor his odious Passion; and, as he plainly perceives
  it, either out of Spight or Diversion, he makes it his Business to
  expose me. I never fail seeing him in all publick Company, where he is
  always most industriously spightful. He hath, in short, told all his
  Acquaintance of our unhappy Affair, they tell theirs; so that it is no
  Secret among his Companions, which are numerous. They, to whom he
  tells it, think they have a Title to be very familiar. If they bow to
  me, and I out of good Manners return it, then I am pester'd with
  Freedoms that are no ways agreeable to my self or Company. If I turn
  my Eyes from them, or seem displeased, they sower upon it, and whisper
  the next Person; he his next; 'till I have at last the Eyes of the
  whole Company upon me. Nay, they report abominable Falshoods, under
  that mistaken Notion, <i>She that will grant Favours to one Man, will to
  a hundred.</i> I beg you will let those who are guilty, know, how
  ungenerous this way of Proceeding is. I am sure he will know himself
  the Person aim'd at, and perhaps put a stop to the Insolence of
  others. Cursed is the Fate of unhappy Women! that Men may boast and
  glory in those things that we must think of with Shame and Horror! You
  have the Art of making such odious Customs appear detestable. For my
  Sake, and I am sure, for the Sake of several others, who dare not own
  it, but, like me, lie under the same Misfortunes, make it as infamous
  for a Man to boast of Favours, or expose our Sex, as it is to take the
  Lie or a Box on the Ear, and not resent it.' <br>
  <i>Your Constant Reader,<br>
  and Admirer,</i> <br>
  <b>Lesbia.</b><br>
<br>
  <i>P. S.</i> 'I am the more Impatient under this Misfortune, having receiv'd
  fresh Provocation, last Wednesday, in the Abbey.'</blockquote><br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
I entirely agree with the amiable and unfortunate <b><i>Lesbia</i></b>, that an
Insult upon a Woman in her Circumstances, is as infamous in a Man, as a
tame Behaviour when the Lie or a Buffet is given; which Truth, I shall
beg leave of her to illustrate by the following Observation.<br>
<br>
It is a Mark of Cowardice passively to forbear resenting an Affront, the
Resenting of which would lead a Man into Danger; it is no less a Sign of
Cowardice to affront a Creature, that hath not Power to avenge it self.
Whatever Name therefore this ungenerous Man may bestow on the helpless
Lady he hath injur'd, I shall not scruple to give him in return for it,
the Appellation of <i>Coward.</i><br>
<br>
A Man, that can so far descend from his Dignity, as to strike a Lady,
can never recover his Reputation with either Sex, because no Provocation
is thought strong enough to justifie such Treatment from the Powerful
towards the Weak. In the Circumstances, in which poor <b>Lesbia</b> is
situated, she can appeal to no Man whatsoever to avenge an Insult, more
grievous than a Blow. If she could open her Mouth, the base Man knows,
that a Husband, a Brother, a generous Friend would die to see her
righted.<br>
<br>
A generous Mind, however enrag'd against an Enemy, feels its Resentments
sink and vanish away, when the Object of its Wrath falls into its Power.
An estranged Friend, filled with Jealousie and Discontent towards a
Bosom-Acquaintance, is apt to overflow with Tenderness and Remorse, when
a Creature, that was once dear to him, undergoes any Misfortune. What
Name then shall we give to his Ingratitude, (who forgetting the Favours
he sollicited with Eagerness, and receiv'd with Rapture) can insult the
Miseries that he himself caused, and make Sport with the Pain to which
he owes his greatest Pleasure? There is but one Being in the Creation
whose Province it is to practise upon the Imbecillities of frail
Creatures, and triumph in the Woes which his own Artifices brought
about; and we well know, those who follow his Example, will receive his
Reward.<br>
<br>
Leaving my fair Correspondent to the Direction of her own Wisdom and
Modesty; and her Enemy, and his mean Accomplices, to the Compunction of
their own Hearts; I shall conclude this Paper with a memorable Instance
of Revenge, taken by a <i>Spanish</i> Lady upon a guilty Lover, which may
serve to show what violent Effects are wrought by the most tender
Passion, when sower'd into Hatred; and may deter the Young and unwary
from unlawful Love. The Story, however Romantick it may appear, I have
heard affirmed for a Truth.<br>
<br>
Not many Years ago an <i>English</i> Gentleman, who in a Rencounter by Night
in the Streets of <i>Madrid</i> had the Misfortune to kill his Man, fled into
a Church-Porch for Sanctuary. Leaning against the Door, he was surprized
to find it open, and a glimmering Light in the Church. He had the
Courage to advance towards the Light; but was terribly startled at the
sight of a Woman in White who ascended from a Grave with a bloody Knife
in her Hand. The Phantome marched up to him, and asked him what he did
there. He told her the Truth, without reserve, believing that he had met
a Ghost: Upon which, she spoke to him in the following Manner.
'Stranger, thou art in my Power: I am a Murderer as thou art. Know then,
that I am a Nun of a noble Family. A base perjur'd Man undid me, and
boasted of it. I soon had him dispatched; but not content with the
Murder, I have brib'd the Sexton to let me enter his Grave, and have now
pluck'd out his False Heart from his Body; and thus I use a Traitor's
Heart.' At these Words she tore it in Pieces, and trampled it under her
Feet.<br>

It is highly laudable to pay Respect to Men who are descended from
worthy Ancestors, not only out of Gratitude to those who have done Good
to Mankind, but as it is an Encouragement to others to follow their
Example. But this is an Honour to be receiv'd, not demanded, by the
Descendants of great Men; and they who are apt to remind us of their
Ancestors, only put us upon making Comparisons to their own
Disadvantage.<br>
<br>
There is some Pretence for boasting of Wit, Beauty, Strength or Wealth,
because the Communication of them may give Pleasure or Profit to others;
but we can have no Merit, nor ought we to claim any Respect, because our
Fathers acted well, whether we would or no.<br>
<br>
The following Letter ridicules the Folly I have mentioned, in a new,
and, I think, not disagreeable Light.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <i>Mr.</i> SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'Were the Genealogy of every Family preserved, there would probably be
  no Man valued or despis'd on Account of his Birth. There is scarce a
  Beggar in the Streets, who would not find himself lineally descended
  from some great Man; nor any one of the highest Title, who would not
  discover several base and indigent Persons among his Ancestors. It
  would be a pleasant Entertainment to see one Pedigree of Men appear
  together, under the same Characters they bore when they acted their
  respective Parts among the Living. Suppose therefore a Gentleman, full
  of his illustrious Family, should, in the same manner as <i>Virgil</i>
  makes <i>&AElig;neas</i> look over his Descendants, see the whole Line of his
  Progenitors pass in a Review before his Eyes, and with how many
  varying Passions would he behold Shepherds and Soldiers, Statesmen and
  Artificers, Princes and Beggars, walk in the Procession of five
  thousand Years! How would his Heart sink or flutter at the several
  Sports of Fortune in a Scene so diversified with Rags and Purple,
  Handicraft Tools and Scepters, Ensigns of Dignity and Emblems of
  Disgrace; and how would his Fears and Apprehensions, his Transports
  and Mortifications, succeed one another, as the Line of his Genealogy
  appear'd bright or obscure?<br>
<br>
  'In most of the Pedigrees hung up in old Mansion Houses, you are sure
  to find the first in the Catalogue a great Statesman, or a Soldier
  with an honourable Commission. The Honest Artificer that begot him,
  and all his frugal Ancestors before him, are torn off from the Top of
  the Register; and you are not left to imagine, that the noble Founder
  of the Family ever had a Father. Were we to trace many boasted Lines
  farther backwards, we should lose them in a Mob of Tradesmen, or a
  Crowd of Rusticks, without hope of seeing them emerge again: Not
  unlike the old <i>Appian</i> Way, which after having run many Miles in
  Length, loses it self in a Bog.<br>
<br>
  'I lately made a Visit to an old Country Gentleman, who is very far
  gone in this sort of <i>Family Madness</i>. I found him in his Study
  perusing an old Register of his Family, which he had just then
  discover'd, as it was branched out in the Form of a Tree, upon a Skin
  of Parchment. Having the Honour to have some of his Blood in my Veins,
  he permitted me to cast my Eye over the Boughs of this venerable
  Plant; and asked my Advice in the Reforming of some of the superfluous
  Branches.<br>
<br>
  'We passed slightly over three or four of our immediate Fore-fathers,
  whom we knew by Tradition, but were soon stopped by an Alderman of
  <i>London</i>, who, I perceived, made my Kinsman's Heart go pit-a-pat. His
  Confusion increased when he found the Alderman's Father to be a
  Grasier; but he recovered his Fright upon seeing <i>Justice of the
  Quorum</i> at the end of his Titles. Things went on pretty well, as we
  threw our Eyes occasionally over the Tree, when unfortunately he
  perceived a Merchant-Tailor perched on a Bough, who was said greatly
  to have encreased the Estate; he was just a going to cut him off, if
  he had not seen <i>Gent.</i> after the Name of his Son; who was recorded to
  have mortgaged one of the Manors his honest Father had purchased. A
  Weaver, who was burnt for his Religion in the Reign of Queen <i>Mary</i>,
  was pruned away without Mercy; as was likewise a Yeoman, who died of a
  Fall from his own Cart. But great was our Triumph in one of the Blood
  who was beheaded for High-Treason; which nevertheless was not a little
  allayed by another of our Ancestors, who was hanged for stealing
  Sheep. The Expectations of my good Cousin were wonderfully raised by a
  Match into the Family of a Knight, but unfortunately for us this
  Branch proved Barren: On the other hand <i>Margery</i> the Milk-maid being
  twined round a Bough, it flourished out into so many Shoots, and bent
  with so much Fruit, that the old Gentleman was quite out of
  Countenance. To comfort me, under this Disgrace, he singled out a
  Branch ten times more fruitful than the other, which, he told me, he
  valued more than any in the Tree, and bad me be of good Comfort. This
  enormous Bough was a Graft out of a <i>Welsh</i> Heiress, with so many
  <i>Ap's</i> upon it that it might have made a little Grove by it self. From
  the Trunk of the Pedigree, which was chiefly composed of Labourers and
  Shepherds, arose a huge Sprout of Farmers; this was branched out into
  Yeomen; and ended in a Sheriff of the County, who was Knighted for his
  good Service to the Crown, in bringing up an Address. Several of the
  Names that seemed to disparage the Family, being looked upon as
  Mistakes, were lopped off as rotten or withered; as, on the contrary,
  no small Number appearing without any Titles, my Cousin, to supply the
  Defects of the Manuscript, added <i>Esq</i>; at the End of each of them.<br>
<br>
  'This Tree so pruned, dressed, and cultivated, was, within few Days,
  transplanted into a large Sheet of Vellum and placed in the great
  Hall, where it attracts the Veneration of his Tenants every <i>Sunday</i>
  Morning, while they wait till his Worship is ready to go to Church;

<br>

It is reckoned a Piece of Ill-breeding for one Man to engross the whole
Talk to himself. For this Reason, since I keep three Visiting-Days in
the Week, I am content now and then to let my Friends put in a Word.
There are several Advantages hereby accruing both to my Readers and my
self. As first, Young and modest Writers have an Opportunity of getting
into Print: Again, The Town enjoys the Pleasure of Variety; and
Posterity will see the Humour of the present Age, by the help of these
little Lights into private and domestick Life. The Benefits I receive
from thence, are such as these: I gain more Time for future
Speculations; pick up Hints which I improve for the publick Good; give
Advice; redress Grievances; and, by leaving commodious Spaces between
the several Letters that I print, furnish out a <i>Spectator</i> with little
Labour and great Ostentation.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <i>Mr.</i> SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'I was mightily pleased with your Speculation of <i>Friday.</i> Your
  Sentiments are Noble, and the whole worked up in such a manner, as
  cannot but strike upon every Reader. But give me leave to make this
  Remark: That while you write so Pathetically on Contentment, and a
  retired Life, you sooth the Passion of Melancholy, and depress the
  Mind from Actions truly Glorious. Titles and Honours are the Reward of
  Virtue: We therefore ought to be affected with them: And tho' light
  Minds are too much puffed up with exterior Pomp, yet I cannot see why
  it is not as truly Philosophical, to admire the glowing Ruby, or the
  sparkling Green of an Emerald, as the fainter and less permanent
  Beauties of a Rose or a Myrtle. If there are Men of extraordinary
  Capacities who lye concealed from the World, I should impute it to
  them as a Blot in their Character, did not I believe it owing to the
  Meanness of their Fortune rather than of their Spirit. <i>Cowley</i>, who
  tells the Story of <i>Agla&uuml;s</i> with so much Pleasure, was no Stranger to
  Courts, nor insensible of Praise.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><i>What shall I do to be for ever known,<br>
    And make the Age to come my own?</i></blockquote>

  was the Result of a laudable Ambition. It was not till after frequent
  Disappointments, that he termed himself the Melancholy <i>Cowley</i>; and
  he praised Solitude, when he despair'd of shining in a Court. The Soul
  of Man is an active Principle. He therefore, who withdraws himself
  from the Scene before he has play'd his Part, ought to be hissed off
  the Stage, and cannot be deemed Virtuous, because he refuses to answer
  his End. I must own I am fired with an honest Ambition to imitate
  every illustrious Example. The Battles of <i>Blenheim</i> and <i>Ramillies</i>
  have more than once made me wish my self a Soldier. And when I have
  seen those Actions so nobly celebrated by our Poets, I have secretly
  aspir'd to be one of that distinguished Class. But in vain I wish, in
  vain I pant with the De<b>Sir</b> e of Action. I am chained down in Obscurity,
  and the only Pleasure I can take is in seeing so many brighter
  Genius's join their friendly Lights, to add to the Splendor of the
  Throne. Farewel then dear <i>Spec</i>, and believe me to be with great
  Emulation, and no Envy,'<br>

 <i> Middle-Temple, October</i> 26, 1714.<br>
<br>
  <i><b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  'Tho' you have formerly made <i>Eloquence</i> the Subject of one or more of
  your Papers, I do not remember that you ever consider'd it as
  possessed by a Set of People, who are so far from making
  <i>Quintilian's</i> Rules their Practice, that, I dare say for them, they
  never heard of such an Author, and yet are no less Masters of it than
  <i>Tully</i> or <i>Demosthenes</i> among the Ancients, or whom you please
  amongst the Moderns. The Persons I am speaking of are our common
  Beggars about this Town; and that what I say is true, I appeal to any
  Man who has a Heart one Degree softer than a Stone. As for my part,
  who don't pretend to more Humanity than my Neighbours, I have
  oftentimes gone from my Chambers with Money in my Pocket, and returned
  to them not only Pennyless, but destitute of a Farthing, without
  bestowing of it any other way than on these seeming Objects of Pity.
  In short, I have seen more Eloquence in a <i>Look</i> from one of these
  despicable Creatures, than in the <i>Eye</i> of the fairest <i>She</i> I ever
  saw, yet no one is a greater Admirer of that Sex than my self. What I
  have to de<b>Sir</b> e of you is, to lay down some Directions in order to
  guard against these powerful Orators, or else I know nothing to the
  contrary but I must my self be forced to leave the Profession of the
  Law, and endeavour to get the Qualifications necessary to that more
  profitable one of Begging. But in which soever of these two Capacities
  I shine, I shall always de<b>Sir</b> e to be your constant Reader, and ever
  will be'<br>
<br>
<i>  Your most humble Servant</i>,<br>
<br>
  J. B.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
  <i><b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  'Upon Reading a <i>Spectator</i> last Week, where Mrs. <i>Fanny Fickle</i>
  submitted the Choice of a Lover for Life to your decisive
  Determination, and imagining I might claim the Favour of your Advice
  in an Affair of the like, but much more difficult Nature, I called for
  Pen and Ink, in order to draw the Characters of Seven Humble Servants,
  whom I have equally encouraged for some time. But alas! while I was
  reflecting on the agreeable Subject, and contriving an advantageous
  Description of the dear Person I was most inclined to favour, I
  happened to look into my Glass. The sight of the Small-Pox, out of
  which I am just recovered, tormented me at once with the loss of my
  captivating Arts and my Captives. The Confusion I was in, on this
  unhappy, unseasonable Discovery, is inexpressible. Believe me, <b>Sir</b> , I
  was so taken up with the Thoughts of your fair Correspondent's Case,
  and so intent on my own Design, that I fancied myself as Triumphant in
  my Conquests as ever.<br>
<br>
  'Now, <b>Sir</b> , finding I was incapacitated to Amuse my self on that
  pleasing Subject, I resolved to apply my self to you, or your
  Casuistical Agent, for Advice in my present Circumstances. I am
  sensible the Tincture of my Skin, and the Regularity of my Features,
  which the Malice of my late Illness has altered, are irrecoverable;
  yet don't despair, but that Loss, by your Assistance, may in some
  measure be reparable, if you'll please to propose a way for the
  Recovery of one only of my Fugitives.<br>
<br>
  'One of them is in a more particular Manner beholden to me than the
  rest; he for some private Reasons being de<b>Sir</b> ous to be a Lover
  incognito, always addressed me with <i>Billet-Doux</i>, which I was so
  careful of in my Sickness, that I secured the Key of my Love-Magazine
  under my Head, and hearing a noise of opening a Lock in my Chamber,
  indangered my Life by getting out of Bed, to prevent, if it had been
  attempted, the Discovery of that Amour.<br>
<br>
  'I have formerly made use of all those Artifices, which our Sex daily
  practises over yours, to draw, as it were undesignedly, the eyes of a
  whole Congregation to my Pew; I have taken a Pride in the number of
  Admirers at my Afternoon Lev&eacute;e; but am now quite another Creature. I
  think, could I regain the attractive Influence I once had, if I had a
  Legion of Suitors, I should never be ambitious of Entertaining more
  than one. I have almost contracted an Antipathy to the trifling
  Discourses of Impertinent Lovers, though I must needs own, I have
  thought it very odd of late, to hear Gentlemen, instead of their usual
  Complacencies, fall into Disputes before me of Politicks, or else
  weary me with the tedious Repetition of how thankful I ought to be,
  and satisfied with my Recovery out of so dangerous a Distemper: This,
  though I am very sensible of the Blessing, yet I cannot but dislike,
  because such Advice from them rather seems to Insult than Comfort me,
  and reminds me too much of what I was; which melancholy Consideration
  I cannot yet perfectly surmount, but hope your Sentiments on this Head
  will make it supportable.<br>
<br>
  'To shew you what a Value I have for your Dictates, these are to
  certify the Persons concern'd, that unless one of them returns to his
  Colours, (if I may so call them now) before the Winter is over, I'll
  voluntarily confine my self to a Retirement, where I'll punish them
  all with my Needle. I'll be reveng'd on them by deciphering them on a
  Carpet, humbly begging Admittance, my self scornfully refusing it: If
  you disapprove of this, as favouring too much of Malice, be pleased to
  acquaint me with a Draught you like better, and it shall be faithfully
  performed'<br>

The following Account hath been transmitted to me by the Love Casuist.
<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
<blockquote>  <i>Mr.</i> SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'Having, in some former Papers, taken Care of the two States of
  Virginity and Marriage, and being willing that all People should be
  served in their Turn; I this Day drew out my Drawer of Widows, where I
  met with several Cases, to each whereof I have returned satisfactory
  Answers by the Post. The Cases are as follow:<br>
<br>
  '<i>Q.</i> Whether <i>Amoret</i> be bound by a Promise of Marriage to
  <i>Philander</i>, made during her Husband's Life?<br>
<br>
  '<i>Q.</i> Whether <i>Sempronia</i>, having faithfully given a Promise to two
  several Persons during the last Sickness of her Husband, is not
  thereby left at Liberty to chase which of them she pleases, or to
  reject them both for the sake of a new Lover?<br>
<br>
  '<i>Cleora</i> asks me, Whether she be obliged to continue single,
  according to a Vow made to her Husband at the time of his presenting
  her with a Diamond Necklace; she being informed by a very pretty young
  Fellow of a good Conscience, that such Vows are in their Nature
  sinful?<br>
<br>
  'Another enquires, Whether she hath not the Right of Widowhood, to
  dispose of her self to a Gentleman of great Merit, who presses very
  hard; her Husband being irrecoverably gone in a Consumption?<br>
<br>
  'An unreasonable Creature hath the Confidence to ask, Whether it be
  proper for her to marry a Man who is younger than her eldest Son?<br>
<br>
  'A scrupulous well-spoken Matron, who gives me a great many good
  Words, only doubts, Whether she is not obliged in Conscience to shut
  up her two marriageable Daughters, till such time as she hath
  comfortably disposed of her self?<br>
<br>
  '<i>Sophronia</i>, who seems by her Phrase and Spelling to be a Person of
  Condition, sets forth, That whereas she hath a great Estate, and is
  but a Woman, she de<b>Sir</b> es to be informed, whether she would not do
  prudently to marry <i>Camillus</i>, a very idle tall young Fellow, who hath
  no Fortune of his own, and consequently hath nothing else to do but to
  manage hers.'</blockquote><br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
Before I speak of Widows, I cannot but observe one thing, which I do not
know how to account for; a Widow is always more sought after, than an
old Maid of the same Age. It is common enough among ordinary People, for
a stale Virgin to set up a Shop in a Place where she is not known; where
the large Thumb Ring, supposed to be given her by her Husband, quickly
recommends her to some wealthy Neighbour, who takes a Liking to the
jolly Widow, that would have overlooked the venerable Spinster.<br>
<br>
The Truth of it is, if we look into this Sett of Women, we find,
according to the different Characters or Circumstances wherein they are
left, that Widows may be divided into those who raise Love, and those
who raise Compassion.<br>
<br>
But not to ramble from this Subject, there are two Things in which
consists chiefly the Glory of a Widow; The Love of her deceased Husband,
and the Care of her Children: To which may be added a third arising out
of the former, Such a prudent Conduct as may do Honour to both.<br>
<br>
A Widow possessed of all these three Qualities, makes not only a
virtuous but a sublime Character.<br>
<br>
There is something so great and so generous in this State of Life, when
it is accompanied with all its Virtues, that it is the Subject of one of
the finest among our modern Tragedies in the Person of <i>Andromache</i>; and
hath met with an universal and deserved Applause, when introduced upon
our <i>English</i> Stage by Mr. <i>Philips.</i><br>
<br>
The most memorable Widow in History is Queen <i>Artemisia</i>, who not only
erected the famous <i>Mausoleum</i>, but drank up the Ashes of her dead Lord;
thereby enclosing them in a nobler Monument than that which she had
built, though deservedly esteemed one of the Wonders of Architecture.<br>
<br>
This last Lady seems to have had a better Title to a second Husband than
any I have read of, since not one Dust of her First was remaining. Our
modern Heroines might think a Husband a very bitter Draught, and would
have good Reason to complain, if they might not accept of a second
Partner, till they had taken such a troublesome Method of losing the
Memory of the first.<br>
<br>
I shall add to these illustrious Examples out of ancient Story, a
remarkable instance of the Delicacy of our Ancestors in Relation to the
State of Widowhood, as I <a name="fr6141">find</a> it recorded in <i>Cowell's</i> Interpreter.<br>
<br>

<i>At</i> East <i>and</i> West-Enborne, <i>in the County of</i> Berks, <i>if a Customary
Tenant die, the Widow shall have what the Law calls her</i> Free-Bench <i>in
all his Copy-hold Lands</i>, dum sola & casta fuerit; <i>that is</i>, while she
lives single and chaste; <i>but if she commit Incontinency, she forfeits
her Estate: Yet if she will come into the Court riding backward upon a
Black Ram, with his Tail in her Hand, and say the Words following, the
Steward is bound by the Custom to re-admit her to her</i> Free-Bench<a href="#f6141"><sup>1</sup></a>.

<blockquote><i>Here I am,<br>
Riding upon a Black Ram,<br>
Like a Whore as I am;<br>
And, for my</i> Crincum Crancum,<br>
<i>Have lost my</i> Bincum Bancum;<br>
<i>And, for my Tail's Game,<br>
Have done this worldly Shame;<br>
Therefore, I pray you Mr. Steward, let me have my Land again.</i></blockquote>

The like Custom there is in the Manor of <i>Torre</i> in <i>Devonshire</i>, and
other Parts of the <i>West.</i><br>
<br>
It is not impossible but I may in a little Time present you with a
Register of <i>Berkshire</i> Ladies and other Western Dames, who rode
publickly upon this Occasion; and I hope the Town will be entertained
with a Cavalcade of Widows.<br>

<br>

It must be owned that Fear is a very powerful Passion, since it is
esteemed one of the greatest of Virtues to subdue it. It being implanted
in us for our Preservation, it is no Wonder it sticks close to us, as
long as we have any thing we are willing to preserve. But as Life, and
all its Enjoyments, would be scarce worth the keeping, if we were under
a perpetual Dread of losing them; it is the Business of Religion and
Philosophy to free us from all unnecessary Anxieties, and direct our
Fear to its proper Object.<br>
<br>
If we consider the Painfulness of this Passion, and the violent Effects
it produces, we shall see how dangerous it is to give way to it upon
slight Occasions. Some have frightened themselves into Madness, others
have given up their Lives to these Apprehensions. The Story of a Man who
grew grey in the Space of one Night's Anxiety is very famous;

<blockquote><i>O! Nox, quam longa es, qu&aelig; facis una Senem.</i></blockquote>

These Apprehensions, if they proceed from a Consciousness of Guilt, are
the sad Warnings of Reason; and may excite our Pity, but admit of no
Remedy. When the Hand of the Almighty is visibly lifted against the
Impious, the Heart of mortal Man cannot withstand him. We have this
Passion <a name="fr6151">sublimely</a> represented in the Punishment of the <i>Egyptians</i>,
tormented with the Plague of Darkness, in the <i>Apocryphal</i> Book. of
<i>Wisdom</i> ascribed to <i>Solomon.</i>

<blockquote>  'For when unrighteous Men thought to oppress the holy Nation; they
  being shut up in their Houses, the Prisoners of Darkness, and fetter'd
  with the Bonds of a long Night, lay here exiled from the eternal
  Providence. For while they supposed to lye hid in their secret Sins,
  they were scattered under a dark Veil of Forgetfulness, being horribly
  astonished and troubled with strange Apparitions&mdash;For Wickedness,
  condemned by her own Witness, is very timorous, and being oppressed
  with Conscience, always forecasteth grievous things. For Fear is
  nothing else but a betraying of the Succours which Reason
  offereth&mdash;For the whole World shined with clear Light, and none were
  hindered in their Labour. Over them only was spread a heavy Night, an
  Image of that Darkness which should afterwards receive them; but yet
  were they unto themselves more grievous than the Darkness.'<a href="#f6151"><sup>1</sup></a></blockquote>

To Fear, so justly grounded, no Remedy can be proposed; but a Man (who
hath no great Guilt hanging upon his Mind, who walks in the plain Path
of Justice and Integrity, and yet either by natural Complection, or
confirmed Prejudices, or Neglect of serious Reflection, suffers himself
to be moved by this abject and unmanly Passion) would do well to
consider, That there is nothing which deserves his Fear, but that
beneficent Being who is his Friend, his Protector, his Father. Were this
one Thought strongly fixed in the Mind, what Calamity would be dreadful?
What Load can Infamy lay upon us when we are sure of the Approbation of
him, who will repay the Disgrace of a Moment with the Glory of Eternity?
What Sharpness is there in Pain and Diseases, when they only hasten us
on to the Pleasures that will never fade? What sting is in Death, when
we are assured that it is only the Beginning of Life? A Man who lives
so, as not to fear to die, is inconsistent with himself, if he delivers
himself up to any incidental Anxiety.<br>
<br>
The Intrepidity <a name="fr6152">of</a> a just good Man is so nobly set forth by <i>Horace</i>,
that it cannot be too often repeated.

<blockquote><i>The Man resolved and steady to his Trust,<br>
Inflexible to Ill, and obstinately just,<br>
May the rude Rabble's Insolence despise,<br>
Their senseless Clamours and tumultuous Cries;<br>
The Tyrant's Fierceness he beguiles,<br>
And the stern Brow, and the harsh Voice defies,<br>
And with superior Greatness smiles.<br><br>

Not the rough Whirlwind, that deforms</i><br>
Adria's <i>black Gulf, and vexes it with Storms,<br>
The stubborn Virtue of his Soul can move;<br>
Not the Red Arm of angry</i> Jove,<br>
<i>That flings the Thunder from the Sky,<br>
And gives it Rage to roar, and Strength to fly.<br><br>

Should the whole Frame of Nature round him break,<br>
In Ruin and Confusion hurl'd,<br>
He, unconcerned, would hear the mighty Crack,<br>
And Stand secure amidst a falling World.</i><a href="#f6152"><sup>2</sup></a></blockquote>

The Vanity of Fear may be yet farther illustrated, if we reflect,<br>
<br>
<i>First</i>, What we fear may not come to pass. No human Scheme can be so
accurately projected, but some little Circumstance intervening may spoil
it. He, who directs the Heart of Man at his Pleasure, and understands
the Thoughts long before, may by ten thousand Accidents, or an immediate
Change in the Inclinations of Men, disconcert the most subtle Project,
and turn it to the Benefit of his own Servants.<br>
<br>
In the next Place we should consider, though the Evil we imagine should
come to pass, it may be much more supportable than it appeared to be. As
there is no prosperous State of Life without its Calamities, so there is
no Adversity without its Benefits, Ask the Great and Powerful, if they
do not feel the Pangs of Envy and Ambition. Enquire of the Poor and
Needy, if they have not tasted the Sweets of Quiet and Contentment. Even
under the Pains of Body; the Infidelity of Friends; or the
Misconstructions put upon our laudable Actions, our Minds (when for some
Time accustomed to these Pressures) are sensible of secret Flowings of
Comfort, the present Reward of a pious Resignation. The Evils of this
Life appear like Rocks and Precipices, rugged and barren at a Distance,
but at our nearer Approach, we find little fruitful Spots, and
refreshing Springs, mixed with the Harshness and Deformities of Nature.<br>
<br>
In the last Place, we may comfort our selves with this Consideration;
that, as the Thing feared may not reach us, so we may not reach what we
fear: Our Lives may not extend to that dreadful Point which we have in
View. He who knows all our Failings, and will not suffer us to be
tempted beyond our Strength, is often pleased in his tender Severity, to
separate the Soul from its Body and Miseries together.<br>
<br>
If we look forward to him for Help, we shall never be in Danger of
falling down those Precipices which our Imagination is apt to create.
Like those who walk upon a Line, if we keep our Eye fixed upon one
Point, we may step forward securely; whereas an imprudent or cowardly
Glance on either Side will infallibly destroy us.<br>

<br>
Martial.<a href="transindex.html#616t"><img src="images/qmark.png" width="15" height="15" align="right" alt="translation"></a></blockquote><br>
<br>

<i>Cicero</i> hath observed, that a Jest is never uttered with a better
Grace, than when it is accompanied with a serious Countenance. When a
pleasant Thought plays in the Features, before it discovers it self in
Words, it raises too great an Expectation, and loses the Advantage of
giving Surprize. Wit and Humour are no less poorly recommended by a
Levity of Phrase, and that kind of Language which may be distinguished
by the Name of <i>Cant.</i> Ridicule is never more strong, than when it is
concealed in Gravity. True Humour lies in the Thought, and arises from
the Representation of Images in odd Circumstances, and uncommon Lights.
A pleasant Thought strikes us by the Force of its natural Beauty; and
the Mirth of it is generally rather palled, than heightened by that
ridiculous Phraseology, which is so much in Fashion among the Pretenders
to Humour and Pleasantry. This Tribe of Men are like our Mountebanks;
they make a Man a Wit, by putting him in a fantastick Habit.<br>
<br>
Our little Burlesque Authors, who are the Delight of ordinary Readers,
generally abound in these pert Phrases, which have in them more Vivacity
than Wit.<br>
<br>
I lately saw an Instance of this kind of Writing, which gave me so
lively an Idea of it, that I could not forbear begging a Copy of the
Letter from the Gentleman who shew'd it to me. It is written by a
Country Wit, upon the Occasion of the Rejoycings on the Day of the
King's Coronation.<br>

<blockquote>  <i><a name="fr6161"></a>Dear</i> Jack, <span style="color: #996633;">(<i>Past two a Clock and a frosty Morning</i>.)</span><a href="#f6161"><sup>1</sup></a><br>
<br>
  I have just left the Right Worshipful and his Myrmidons about a
  Sneaker of Five Gallons. The whole Magistracy was pretty well
  disguised before I gave 'em the Slip. Our Friend the Alderman was half
  Seas over before the Bonfire was out. We had with us the Attorney, and
  two or three other bright Fellows. The Doctor plays least in Sight.<br>
<br>
  At Nine a Clock in the Evening we set Fire to the Whore of <i>Babylon.</i>
  The Devil acted his Part to a Miracle. He has made his Fortune by it.
  We equip'd the young Dog with a Tester a-piece. Honest old <i>Brown</i> of
  <i>England</i> was very drunk, and showed his Loyalty to the Tune of a
  hundred Rockets. The Mob drank the King's Health, on their
  Marrow-bones, in Mother <i>Day's</i> Double. They whip'd us half a dozen
  Hogsheads. Poor <i>Tom Tyler</i> had like to have been demolished with the
  End of a Sky-Rocket, that fell upon the Bridge of his Nose as he was
  drinking the King's Health, and spoiled his Tip. The Mob were very
  loyal 'till about Midnight, when they grew a little mutinous for more
  Liquor. They had like to have dumfounded the Justice; but his Clerk
  came in to his Assistance, and took them all down in Black and White.<br>
<br>

  When I had been huzza'd out of my Seven Senses, I made a Visit to the
  Women, who were guzzling very comfortably. Mrs. Mayoress clip'd the
  King's <i>English.</i> Clack was the Word.<br>
<br>
  I forgot to tell thee, that every one of the Posse had his Hat cocked
  with a Distich: The Senators sent us down a Cargo of Ribbon and Metre
  for the Occasion.<br>
<br>
  <b>Sir</b>  <i>Richard</i> to shew his Zeal for the Protestant Religion, is at the
  Expence of a Tar-Barrel and a Ball. I peeped into the Knight's great
  Hall, and saw a very pretty Bevy of Spinsters. My dear Relict was
  amongst them, and ambled in a Country-Dance as notably as the best of
  'em.<br>
<br>
  May all his Majesty's liege Subjects love him as well as his good
  People of this his ancient Borough. Adieu.</blockquote><br>

There are two Extreams in the Stile of Humour, one of which consists in
the Use of that little pert Phraseology which I took Notice of in my
last Paper; the other in the Affectation of strained and pompous
Expressions, fetched from the learned Languages. The first savours too
much of the Town; the other of the College.<br>
<br>
As nothing illustrates better than Example, I shall here present my
Reader with a Letter of Pedantick Humour, which was written by a young
Gentleman of the University to his Friend; on the same Occasion, and
from the same Place, as the lively Epistle published in my<a href="#section616"> last
<i>Spectator.</i></a><br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <i>Dear Chum</i>,<br>
<br>
  'It is now the third Watch of the Night, the greatest Part of which I
  have spent round a capacious Bowl of <i>China</i>, filled with the choicest
  Products of both the <i>Indies.</i> I was placed at a quadrangular Table,
  diametrically opposite to the Mace-bearer. The Visage of that
  venerable Herald was, according to Custom, most gloriously illuminated
  on this joyful occasion. The Mayor and Aldermen, those Pillars of our
  Constitution, began to totter; and if any one at the Board could have
  so far articulated, as to have demanded intelligibly a Reinforcement
  of Liquor, the whole Assembly had been by this time extended under the
  Table.<br>
<br>
  'The Celebration of this Night's Solemnity was opened by the
  Obstreperous Joy of Drummers, who, with their Parchment Thunder, gave
  a signal for the Appearance of the Mob under their several Classes and
  Denominations. They were quickly joined by the melodious Clank of
  Marrow-bone and Cleaver, whilst a Chorus of Bells filled up the
  Consort. A Pyramid of Stack-Faggots cheared the Hearts of the Populace
  with the Promise of a Blaze: The Guns had no sooner uttered the
  Prologue, but the Heavens were brightned with artificial Meteors, and
  Stars of our own making; and all the <i>High-street</i> lighted up from one
  End to another, with a Galaxy of Candles. We collected a Largess for
  the Multitude, who tippled Eleemosynary till they grew exceeding
  Vociferous. There was a Paste-board Pontiff with a little swarthy
  D&aelig;mon at his Elbow, who, by his diabolical Whispers and Insinuations
  tempted his Holiness into the Fire, and then left him to shift for
  himself. The Mobile were very sarcastick with their Clubs, and gave
  the old Gentleman several Thumps upon his triple Head-piece. <i>Tom
  Tyler's </i>Phiz is something damaged by the Fall of a Rocket, which hath
  almost spoiled the Gnomon of his Countenance. The Mirth of the Commons
  grew so very outragious, that it found Work for our Friend of the
  <i>Quorum</i>, who, by the help of his <i>Amanuensis</i>, took down all their
  Names and their Crimes, with a Design to produce his Manuscript at the
  next Quarter-Sessions, <i>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</i><br>
<br>
  'I shall subjoin to the foregoing Piece of a Letter, the following
  Copy of Verses <a name="fr6171">translated</a> from an <i>Italian</i> Poet, who was the
  <i>Cleveland</i> of his Age, and had Multitudes of Admirers. The Subject is
  an Accident that happened under the Reign of Pope <i>Leo</i>, when a
  Firework, that had been prepared upon the Castle of St. <i>Angelo</i>,
  begun to play before its Time, being kindled by a Flash of Lightning.
  The Author hath written his Poem<a href="#f6171"><sup>1</sup></a> in the same kind of Style, as
  that I have already exemplified in Prose. Every Line in it is a
  Riddle, and the Reader must be forced to consider it twice or thrice,
  before he will know that the <i>Cynick's</i> Tenement is a <i>Tub</i>, and
  <i>Bacchus</i> his Cast-coat a <i>Hogs-head</i>, &amp;c.

<blockquote><i>'Twas Night, and Heav'n, a</i> Cyclops, <i>all the Day,<br>
An Argus now did countless Eyes display;<br>
In ev'ry Window</i> Rome <i>her Joy declares,<br>
All bright, and studded with terrestrial Stars.<br>
A blazing Chain of Lights her Roofs entwines.<br>
And round her Neck the mingled Lustre shines,<br>
The</i> Cynick's <i>rowling Tenement conspires,<br>
With</i> Bacchus <i>his Cast-coat, to feed the Fires.<br><br>

The Pile, still big with undiscover'd Shows,<br>
The</i> Tuscan <i>Pile did last its Freight disclose,<br>
Where the proud Tops of</i> Rome's <i>new</i> &AElig;tna <i>rise,<br>
Whence Giants sally, and invade the Skies.<br><br>

Whilst now the Multitude expect the Time,<br>
And their tir'd Eyes the lofty Mountain climb,<br>
A thousand Iron Mouths their Voices try,<br>
And thunder out a dreadful Harmony;<br>
In treble Notes the small Artill'ry plays,<br>
The deep-mouth'd Cannon bellows in the Bass.<br>
The lab'ring Pile now heaves; and having giv'n<br>
Proofs of its Travail sighs in Flames to Heav'n.<br><br>

The Clouds invelop'd Heav'n from Human Sight,<br>
Quench'd every Star, and put out ev'ry Light;<br>
Now Real Thunder grumbles in the Skies,<br>
And in disdainful Murmurs</i> Rome <i>defies;<br>
Nor doth its answer'd Challenge</i> Rome <i>decline;<br>
But whilst both Parties in full Consort join,<br>
While Heav'n and Earth in Rival Peals resound,<br>
The doubtful Cracks the Hearer's Sense confound;<br>
Whether the Claps of Thunderbolts they hear,<br>
Or else the Burst of Canon wounds their Ear;<br>
Whether Clouds raged by struggling Metals rent,<br>
Or struggling Clouds in</i> Roman <i>Metals pent.<br>
But O, my Muse, the whole Adventure tell,<br>
As ev'ry Accident in order fell.<br><br>

Tall Groves of Trees the</i> Hadrian <i>Tow'r surround,<br>
Fictitious Trees with Paper Garlands crown'd,<br>
These know no Spring, but when their Bodies sprout<br>
In Fire, and shoot their gilded Blossoms out;<br>
When blazing Leaves appear above their Head,<br>
And into branching Flames their Bodies spread.<br>
Whilst real Thunder splits the Firmament,<br>
And Heav'n's whole Roof in one vast Cleft is rent,<br>
The three-fork'd Tongue amidst the Rupture lolls,<br>
Then drops and on the Airy Turret falls.<br>
The Trees now kindle, and the Garland burns,<br>
And thousand Thunderbolts for one returns.<br>
Brigades of burning Archers upward fly,<br>
Bright Spears and shining Spear-men mount on high,<br>
Flash in the Clouds, and glitter in the Sky.<br>
A Seven-fold Shield of Spheres doth Heav'n defend,<br>
And back again the blunted Weapons send;<br>
Unwillingly they fall, and dropping down,<br>
Pour out their Souls, their sulph'rous Souls, and groan.<br><br>

With Joy, great <b>Sir</b> , we viewed this pompous Show,<br>
While Heaven, that sate <b>Spectator</b> still 'till now,<br>
It self turn'd Actor, proud to Pleasure you.<br>
And so 'tis fit, when</i> Leo's <i>fires appear,<br>
That Heav'n it self should turn an Engineer;<br>
That Heav'n it self should all its Wonders show,<br>
And Orbs above consent with Orbs below.</i></blockquote></blockquote><br>

<br>
  <i>Mr.</i> SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  You having, in your two last <i><b>Spectators</b></i>, given the Town a couple of
  Remarkable Letters, in very different Styles: I take this Opportunity
  to offer to you some Remarks upon the <i>Epistolary</i> way of writing in
  Verse. This is a <i>Species</i> of Poetry by it self; and has not so much
  as been hinted at in any of the Arts of Poetry, that have ever fallen
  into my Hands: Neither has it in any Age, or any Nation, been so much
  cultivated, as the other several Kinds of Poesie. A Man of <i>Genius</i>
  may, if he pleases, write Letters in Verse upon all manner of
  Subjects, that are capable of being embellished with Wit and Language,
  and may render them new and agreeable by giving the proper Turn to
  them. But in speaking, at present, of <i>Epistolary Poetry</i>, I would be
  understood to mean only such Writings in this Kind, as have been in
  Use amongst the Ancients, and have been copied from them by some
  Moderns. These may be reduced into two <i>Classes:</i> In the one I shall
  range Love-Letters, Letters of Friendship, and Letters upon mournful
  Occasions: In the other I shall place such Epistles in Verse, as may
  properly be called Familiar, Critical, and Moral; to which may be
  added Letters of Mirth and Humour. <i>Ovid</i> for the first, and <i>Horace</i>
  for the Latter, are the best Originals we have left.<br>
<br>
  'He that is ambitious of succeeding in the <i>Ovidian</i> way, should first
  examine his Heart well, and feel whether his Passions (especially
  those of the gentler Kind) play easie, since it is not his Wit, but
  the Delicacy and Tenderness of his Sentiments, that will affect his
  Readers. His Versification likewise should be soft, and all his
  Numbers flowing and querulous.<br>
<br>
  'The Qualifications requisite for writing Epistles, after the Model
  given us by <i>Horace</i>, are of a quite different Nature. He that would
  excel in this kind must have a good Fund of strong Masculine Sense: To
  this there must be joined a thorough Knowledge of Mankind, together
  with an Insight into the Business, and the prevailing Humours of the
  Age. Our Author must have his Mind well seasoned with the finest
  Precepts of Morality, and be filled with nice Reflections upon the
  bright and the dark sides of human Life: He must be a Master of
  refined Raillery, and understand the Delicacies, as well as the
  Absurdities of Conversation. He must have a lively Turn of Wit, with
  an easie and concise manner of Expression; Every thing he says, must
  be in a free and disengaged manner. He must be guilty of nothing that
  betrays the Air of a Recluse, but appear a Man of the World
  throughout. His Illustrations, his Comparisons, and the greatest part
  of his Images must be drawn from common Life. Strokes of Satyr and
  Criticism, as well as Panegyrick, judiciously thrown in (and as it
  were by the by) give a wonderful Life and Ornament to Compositions of
  this kind. But let our Poet, while he writes Epistles, though never so
  familiar, still remember that he writes in Verse, and must for that
  reason have a more than ordinary care not to fall into Prose, and a
  vulgar Diction, excepting where the Nature and Humour of the Thing
  does necessarily require it. In this Point <i>Horace</i> hath been thought
  by some Criticks to be sometimes careless, as well as too negligent of
  his Versification; of which he seems to have been sensible himself.<br>
<br>
  'All I have to add is, that both these Manners of Writing may be made
  as entertaining, in their Way, as any other Species of Poetry, if
  undertaken by Persons duly qualify'd; and the latter sort may be
  managed so as to become in a peculiar manner Instructive. <i>I am, &amp;ct.</i>'</blockquote><br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
I shall add an Observation or two to the Remarks of my ingenious
Correspondent, and, in the First place, take Notice, that Subjects of
the most sublime Nature are often treated in the Epistolary way with
Advantage, as in the famous Epistle of <i>Horace</i> to <i>Augustus.</i> The Poet
surprizes us with his Pomp, and seems rather betrayed into his Subject,
than to have aimed at it by Design: He appears like the Visit of a King
<i>Incognito</i>, with a mixture of Familiarity, and Grandeur. In Works of
this kind, when the Dignity of the Subject hurries the Poet into
Descriptions and Sentiments, seemingly unpremeditated, by a sort of
Inspiration; it is usual for him to recollect himself, and fall back
gracefully into the natural Stile of a Letter.<br>
<br>
I might here mention an Epistolary Poem, just published by Mr. <i>Eusden</i>
on the King's Accession to the Throne: Wherein, amongst many other noble
and beautiful Strokes of Poetry, his Reader may see this Rule very
happily observed.<br>

I have often thought, that if the several Letters, which are written to
me under the Character of SPECTATOR, and which I have not made use of,
were published in a Volume, they would not be an unentertaining
Collection. The Variety of the Subjects, Styles, Sentiments, and
Informations, which are transmitted to me, would lead a very curious, or
very idle Reader, insensibly along, through a great many Pages. I know
some Authors, who <a name="fr6191">would</a> pick up a <i>Secret History</i> out of such
Materials, and make a Bookseller an Alderman by the Copy<a href="#f6191"><sup>1</sup></a>. I shall

And from the Theme unlabour'd Beauties rise.<br><br>

By longing Nations for the Throne design'd,<br>
And call'd to guard the Rights of Human-kind;<br>
With secret Grief his God-like Soul repines,<br>
And</i> Britain's <i>Crown with joyless Lustre shines,<br>
While Prayers and Tears his destin'd Progress stay,<br>
And Crowds of Mourners choak their Sovereign's Way.<br>
Not so he march'd, when Hostile Squadrons stood<br>
In Scenes of Death, and fir'd his generous Blood;<br>
When his hot Courser paw'd th'</i> Hungarian <i>Plain,<br>
And adverse Legions stood the Shock in vain.<br><br>

His Frontiers past, the</i> Belgian <i>Bounds he views,<br>
And cross the level Fields his March pursues.<br>
Here pleas'd the Land of Freedom to survey,<br>
He greatly scorns the Thirst of boundless Sway.<br>
O'er the thin Soil, with silent Joy he spies<br>
Transplanted Woods, and borrow'd Verdure rise;<br>
Where every Meadow won with Toil and Blood,<br>
From haughty Tyrants, and the raging Flood,<br>
With Fruits and Flowers the careful Hind supplies,<br>
And cloathes the Marshes in a rich Disguise.<br>
Such Wealth for frugal Hands doth Heaven decree,<br>
And such thy Gifts, Celestial Liberty!<br><br>

Through stately Towns, and many a fertile Plain,<br>
The Pomp advances to the neighbouring Main.<br>
Whole Nations crowd around with joyful Cries,<br>
And view the Heroe with insatiate Eyes.<br>
In</i> Haga's <i>Towers he waits, 'till Eastern Gales<br>
Propitious rise to swell the</i> British <i>Sails.<br>
Hither the Fame of</i> England's <i>Monarch brings<br>
The Vows and Friendships of the neighb'ring Kings;<br>
Mature in Wisdom, his extensive Mind<br>
Takes in the blended Int'rests of Mankind,<br>
The World's great Patriot. Calm thy anxious Breast,<br>
Secure in him</i>, O Europe <i>take thy Rest;<br>
Henceforth thy Kingdoms shall remain confined<br>
By Rocks or Streams, the Mounds which Heav'n design'd:<br>
The</i> Alps <i>their new-made Monarch shall restrain,<br>
Nor shall thy Hills</i>, Pirene, <i>rise in vain<br><br>

But see! to</i> Britain's <i>Isle the Squadrons stand,<br>
And leave the sinking Towers, and lessening Land,<br>
The Royal Bark bounds o'er the floating Plain,<br>
Breaks thro' the Billows, and divides the Main,<br>
O'er the vast Deep, Great Monarch, dart thine Eyes,<br>
A watry Prospect bounded by the Skies:<br>
Ten thousand Vessels, from ten thousand Shores,<br>
Bring Gums and Gold, and either</i> India's <i>Stores:<br>
Behold the Tributes hastening to thy Throne,<br>
And see the wide Horizon all thy own.<br><br>

Still is it thine; tho' now the cheerful Crew<br>
Hail</i> Albion's <i>Cliffs, just whitening to the View.<br>
Before the Wind with swelling Sails they ride,<br>
Till</i> Thames <i>receives them in his opening Tide.<br>
The Monarch hears the thundering Peals around,<br>
From trembling Woods and ecchoing Hills rebound,<br>
Nor misses yet, amid the deafening Train,<br>
The Roarings of the hoarse-resounding Main.<br><br>

As in the Flood he sails, from either Side<br>
He views his Kingdom in its rural Pride;<br>
A various Scene the wide-spread Landskip yields,<br>
O'er rich Enclosures and luxuriant Fields:<br>
A lowing Herd each fertile Pasture fills,<br>
And distant Flocks stray o'er a thousand Hills.<br>
Fair</i> Greenwich <i>hid in Woods, with new Delight,<br>
(Shade above Shade) now rises to the Sight:<br>
His Woods ordain'd to visit every Shore,<br>
And guard the Island which they graced before.<br><br>

The Sun now rowling down the Western Way,<br>
A Blaze of Fires renews the fading Day;<br>
Unnumbered Barks the Regal Barge infold,<br>
Brightening the Twilight with its beamy Gold;<br>
Less thick the finny Shoals, a countless Fry,<br>
Before the Whale or kingly Dolphin fly.<br>
In one vast Shout he seeks the crowded Strand,<br>
And in a Peal of Thunder gains the Land.<br><br>

Welcome, great Stranger, to our longing Eyes,<br>
Oh! King de<b>Sir</b> 'd, adopted</i> Albion <i>cries.<br>
For thee the East breath'd out a prosperous Breeze,<br>
Bright were the Suns, and gently swell'd the Seas.<br>
Thy Presence did each doubtful Heart compose,<br>
And Factions wonder'd that they once were Foes;<br>
That joyful Day they lost each Hostile Name,<br>
The same their Aspect, and their Voice the same.<br><br>

So two fair Twins, whose Features were design'd<br>
At one soft Moment in the Mother's Mind,<br>
Show each the other with reflected Grace,<br>
And the same Beauties bloom in either Face;<br>
The puzzled Strangers which is which enquire,<br>

<br>

The following Letter having in it some Observations out of the common
Road, I shall make it the Entertainment of this Day.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <i>Mr.</i> SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'The common Topicks against the Pride of Man which are laboured by
  florid and declamatory Writers, are taken from the Baseness of his
  Original, the Imperfections of his Nature, or the short Duration of
  those Goods in which he makes his Boast. Though it be true that we can
  have nothing in us that ought to raise our Vanity, yet a Consciousness
  of our own Merit may be sometimes laudable. The Folly therefore lyes
  here: We are apt to pride our selves in worthless, or perhaps shameful
  Things; and, on the other hand, count that disgraceful which is our
  truest Glory.<br>
<br>
  'Hence it is, that the Lovers of Praise take wrong Measures to attain
  it. Would a vain Man consult his own Heart, he would find that if
  others knew his Weaknesses as well as he himself doth, he could not
  have the Impudence to expect the publick Esteem. Pride therefore flows
  from want of Reflection, and Ignorance of our selves. Knowledge and
  Humility come upon us together.<br>
<br>
  'The proper way to make an Estimate of our selves, is to consider
  seriously what it is we value or despise in others. A Man who boasts
  of the Goods of Fortune, a gay Dress or a new Title, is generally the
  Mark of Ridicule. We ought therefore not to admire in our selves, what
  we are so ready to laugh at in other Men.<br>
<br>
  'Much less can we with Reason pride our selves in those things, which
  at some time of our Life we shall certainly despise. And yet, if we
  will give our selves the Trouble of looking backward and forward on
  the several Changes, which we have already undergone and hereafter
  must try, we shall find that the greater Degrees of our Knowledge and
  Wisdom, serve only to shew us our own Imperfections.<br>
<br>
  'As we rise from Childhood to Youth, we look with Contempt on the Toys
  and Trifles which our Hearts have hitherto been set upon. When, we
  advance to Manhood, we are held wise in proportion to our Shame and
  Regret for the Rashness and Extravagance of Youth. Old Age fills us
  with mortifying Reflections upon a Life, mis-spent in the Pursuit of
  anxious Wealth or uncertain Honour. Agreeable to this Gradation of
  Thought in this Life, it may be reasonably supposed, that in a future
  State, the Wisdom, the Experience, and the Maxims of old Age, will be
  looked upon by a separate Spirit in much the same Light, as an ancient
  Man now sees the little Follies and Toyings of Infants. The Pomps, the
  Honours, the Policies, and Arts of mortal Men, will be thought as
  trifling as Hobby-Horses, Mock Battles, or any other Sports that now
  employ all the Cunning, and Strength, and Ambition of rational Beings
  from four Years old to nine or ten.<br>
<br>
  'If the Notion of a gradual Rise in Beings, from the meanest to the
  most High, be not a vain Imagination, it is not improbable that an
  Angel looks down upon a Man, as a Man doth upon a Creature which
  approaches the nearest to the rational Nature. By the same Rule (if I
  may indulge my Fancy in this Particular) a superior Brute looks with a
  kind of Pride on one of an inferior Species. If they could reflect, we
  might imagine from the Gestures of some of them, that they think
  themselves the Sovereigns of the World, and that all things were made
  for them. Such a Thought would not be more absurd in Brute Creatures,
  than one which Men are apt to entertain, namely, That all the Stars in
  the Firmament were created only to please their Eyes and amuse their
  Imaginations. Mr. <i>Dryden</i>, in his Fable of the <i>Cock and the Fox</i>,
  makes a Speech for his Hero the Cock, which is a pretty Instance for
  this Purpose,

<blockquote><i>Then turning, said to</i> Partlet, <i>See, my Dear,<br>
How lavish Nature hath adorn'd the Year;<br>
How the pale Primrose and the Violet spring,<br>
And Birds essay their Throats, disus'd to sing:<br>
All these are ours, and I with Pleasure see<br>
Man strutting on two Legs, and aping me.</i></blockquote>

  'What I would observe from the Whole is this, That we ought to value
  our selves upon those Things only which superior Beings think
  valuable, since that is the only way for us not to sink in our own
  Esteem hereafter.</blockquote><br>

<br>
  <i>Mr.</i> SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'In a former Speculation you have observed, that true Greatness doth
  not consist in that Pomp and Noise wherein the Generality of Mankind
  are apt to place it. You have there taken Notice, that Virtue in
  Obscurity often appears more illustrious in the Eye of superior
  Beings, than all that passes for Grandeur and Magnificence among Men.<br>
<br>
  When we look back upon the History of those who have born the Parts of
  Kings, Statesmen, or Commanders, they appear to us stripped of those
  out-side Ornaments that dazzled their Contemporaries; and we regard
  their Persons as great or little, in Proportion to the Eminence of
  their Virtues or Vices. The wise Sayings, generous Sentiments, or
  disinterested Conduct of a Philosopher under mean Circumstances of
  Life, set him higher in our Esteem than the mighty Potentates of the
  Earth, when we view them both through the long Prospect of many Ages.
  Were the Memoirs of an obscure Man, who lived up to the Dignity of his
  Nature, and according to the Rules of Virtue, to be laid before us, we
  should find nothing in such a Character which might not set him on a
  Level with Men of the highest Stations. The following Extract out of
  the private Papers of an honest Country-Gentleman will set this Matter
  in a clear Light. Your Reader will perhaps conceive a greater Idea of
  him from these Actions done in Secret, and without a Witness, than of
  those which have drawn upon them the Admiration of Multitudes.

<blockquote>    <b><i>Memoirs.</i></b><br>
<br>
    "In my 22d Year I found a violent Affection for my Cousin
    <i>Charles's</i> Wife growing upon me, wherein I was in danger of
    succeeding, if I had not upon that Account begun my Travels into
    foreign Countries.<br>
<br>
    "A little after my Return into <i>England</i>, at a private Meeting with
    my Uncle <i>Francis</i>, I refused the Offer of his Estate, and prevailed
    upon him not to disinherit his Son <i>Ned.</i><br>
<br>
    "<i>Mem.</i> Never to tell this to <i>Ned</i>, lest he should think hardly of
    his deceased Father; though he continues to speak ill of me for this
    very Reason.<br>
<br>
    "Prevented a scandalous Law-suit betwixt my Nephew <i>Harry</i> and his
    Mother, by allowing her under-hand, out of my own Pocket, so much
    Money yearly as the Dispute was about.<br>
<br>
    "Procured a Benefice for a young Divine, who is Sister's Son to the
    good Man who was my Tutor, and hath been dead Twenty Years.<br>
<br>
    "Gave Ten Pounds to poor Mrs.&mdash;, my Friend <i>H&mdash;</i>'s Widow.<br>
<br>
    "<i>Mem.</i> To retrench one Dish at my Table, till I have fetched it up
    again.<br>
<br>
    "<i>Mem.</i> To repair my House and finish my Gardens in order to employ
    poor People after Harvest time.<br>
<br>
    "Ordered <i>John</i> to let out Goodman D&mdash;'s Sheep that were pounded, by
    Night: but not to let his Fellow-Servants know it.<br>
<br>
    "Prevailed upon <i>M. T.</i> Esq., not to take the Law of the Farmer's
    Son for shooting a Partridge, and to give him his Gun again.<br>
<br>
    "Paid the Apothecary for curing an old Woman that confessed her self
    a Witch.<br>
<br>
    "Gave away my favourite Dog for biting a Beggar.<br>
<br>
    "Made the Minister of the Parish and a <i>Whig</i> Justice of one Mind,
    by putting them upon explaining their Notions to one another.<br>
<br>
    "<i>Mem</i>, To turn off <i>Peter</i> for shooting a Doe while she was eating
    Acorns out of his Hand.<br>

I <a name="fr6232">am</a> obliged to my Friend, the <i>Love-Casuist</i><a href="#f6232"><sup>2</sup></a>, for the following
Curious Piece of Antiquity, which I shall communicate to the Publick in
his own Words.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
<blockquote>  <i>Mr.</i> SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'You may remember, that I lately transmitted to you an Account of an
  ancient Custom, in the Manors of East <i>and</i> West-Enborne, <i>in the
  County of</i> Berks, <i>and elsewhere. If a Customary Tenant die, the Widow
  shall have what the Law calls her</i> Free-Bench <i>in all his Copyhold
  Lands</i>, dum sola et casta fuerit, <i>that is</i>, while she lives single
  and chaste; <i>but if she commits Incontinency, she forfeits her Estate;
  Yet if she will come into the Court riding backward upon a Black Ram,
  with his Tail in her Hand, and say the Words following, the Steward is
  bound by the Custom to re-admit her to her</i> Free-Bench.

<blockquote><i>Here I am,<br>
Riding upon a Black Ram,<br>
Like a Whore as I am;<br>
And, for my</i> Crincum Crancum,<br>
<i>Have lost my</i> Bincum Bancum;<br>
<i>And, for my Tail's Game,<br>
Have done this worldly Shame;<br>
Therefore, I pray you Mr. Steward, let me have my Land again.</i></blockquote>

  'After having informed you that my Lord <i>Coke</i> observes, that this is
  the most frail and slippery Tenure of any in <i>England</i>, I shall tell
  you, since the Writing of that Letter, I have, according to my
  Promise, been at great Pains in searching out the Records of the
  <i>Black Ram</i>; and have at last met with the Proceedings of the
  Court-Baron, held in that Behalf, for the Space of a whole Day. The
  Record saith, that a strict Inquisition having been made into the
  Right of the Tenants to their several Estates, by a crafty old
  Steward, he found that many of the Lands of the Manor were, by default
  of the several Widows, forfeited to the Lord, and accordingly would
  have enter'd on the Premises: Upon which the good Women demanded the
  Benefit of the Ram. The <a name="fr6233">Steward</a>, after having perused their several
  Pleas, adjourn'd the Court to <i>Barnaby-bright</i><a href="#f6233"><sup>3</sup></a>, that they might
  have Day enough before them.<br>
<br>
  'The Court being set, and filled with a great Concourse of People, who
  came from all Parts to see the Solemnity, the first who entered was
  the Widow <i>Frontly</i>, who had made her Appearance in the last Year's
  Cavalcade. The Register observes, that finding it an easy Pad-Ram, and
  foreseeing she might have further Occasion for it, she purchased it of
  the Steward.<br>
<br>
  'Mrs. <i>Sarah Dainty</i>, Relict of Mr. <i>John Dainty</i>, (who was the
  greatest Prude in the Parish) came next in the Procession. She at
  first made some Difficulty of taking the Tail in her Hand; and was
  observed in pronouncing the Form of Penance, to soften the two most
  emphatical Words into <i>Clincum Clancum</i>: But the Steward took care to
  make her speak plain <i>English</i> before he would <i>let her have her Land
  again.</i><br>
<br>
  'The third Widow that was <i>brought to this worldly Shame</i>, being
  mounted upon a vicious Ram, had the Misfortune to be thrown by him;
  upon which she hoped to be excused from going thro' the rest of the
  Ceremony: But the Steward being well versed in the Law, observed very
  wisely upon this Occasion, that the breaking of the Rope does not
  hinder the Execution of the Criminal.<br>
<br>
  'The fourth Lady upon Record was the Widow <i>Ogle</i>, a famous Coquette,
  who had kept half a Score young Fellows off and on for the Space of
  two Years; but having been more kind to her Carter <i>John</i>, she was
  introduced with the Huzza's of all her Lovers about her.<br>
<br>
  'Mrs. <i>Sable</i> appearing in her Weeds, which were very new and fresh,
  and of the same Colour with her whimsical <i>Palfrey</i>, made a very
  decent Figure in the Solemnity.<br>
<br>
  'Another, who had been summoned to make her Appearance, was excused by
  the Steward, as well knowing in his Heart, that the good Squire
  himself had qualified her for the Ram.<br>
<br>
  'Mrs. <i>Quick</i> having nothing to object against the Indictment, pleaded
  her Belly. But it was remembred that she made the same Excuse the Year
  before. Upon which the Steward observ'd, that she might so contrive
  it, as never to do the Service of the Manor.<br>
<br>
  'The Widow <i>Fidget</i> being cited into Court, insisted that she had done
  no more since the Death of her Husband, than what she used to do in
  his Life-time; and withal de<b>Sir</b> 'd Mr. Steward to consider his own
  Wife's Case, if he should chance to die before her.<br>
<br>
  'The next in order was a Dowager of a very corpulent Make, who would
  have been excused as not finding any Ram that was able to carry her;
  upon which the Steward commuted her Punishment, and ordered her to
  make her Entry upon a black Ox.<br>
<br>
  'The Widow <i>Maskwell</i>, a Woman who had long lived with a most
  unblemished Character, having turned off her old Chamber-maid in a
  Pet, was by that revengeful Creature brought in upon the black Ram
  Nine times the same Day.<br>
<br>
  'Several Widows of the Neighbourhood, being brought upon their Tryal,
  they shewed that they did not hold of the Manor, and were discharged
  accordingly.<br>
<br>
  'A pretty young Creature who closed the Procession, came ambling in,
  with so bewitching an Air, that the Steward was observ'd to cast a
  Sheep's Eye upon her, and married her within a Month after the Death
  of his Wife.<br>
<br>
  '<i>N. B.</i> Mrs. <i>Touchwood</i> appeared, according to Summons, but had
  nothing laid to her Charge; having liv'd irreproachably since the
  Decease of her Husband, who left her a Widow in the Sixty-ninth Year
  of her Age.'<br>
<br>

Mankind is divided into two Parts, the Busie and the Idle. The Busie
World may be divided into the Virtuous and the Vicious. The Vicious
again into the Covetous, the Ambitious, and the Sensual. The idle Part
of Mankind are in a State inferior to any one of these. All the other
are engaged in the Pursuit of Happiness, though often misplaced, and are
therefore more likely to be attentive to such Means, as shall be
proposed to them for that End. The Idle, who are neither wise for this
World, nor the next, are emphatically called by <i>Dr. Tillotson, Fools
at large</i>. They propose to themselves no End, but run adrift with every
Wind. Advice therefore would be but thrown away upon them, since they
would scarce take the Pains to read it. I shall not fatigue any of this
worthless Tribe with a long Harangue; but will leave them with this
short Saying of <i>Plato</i>, that <i>Labour is preferable to Idleness, as
Brightness to Rust.</i><br>
<br>
The Pursuits of the Active Part of Mankind, are either in the Paths of
Religion and Virtue; or, on the other Hand, in the Roads to Wealth,
Honours or Pleasure. I shall therefore compare the Pursuits of Avarice,
Ambition and sensual Delight, with their opposite Virtues; and shall
consider which of these Principles engages Men in a Course of the
greatest Labour, Suffering and Assiduity. Most Men, in their cool
Reasonings, are willing to allow that a Course of Virtue will in the End
be rewarded the most amply; but represent the Way to it as rugged and
narrow. If therefore it can be made appear, that Men struggle through as
many Troubles to be miserable, as they do to be happy, my Readers may
perhaps be perswaded to be Good, when they find they shall lose nothing
by it.<br>
<br>
<i>First</i>, for Avarice. The Miser is more Industrious than the Saint: The
Pains of getting, the Fears of losing, and the Inability of enjoying his
Wealth, have been the Mark of Satyr in all Ages. Were his Repentance
upon his Neglect of a good Bargain, his Sorrow for being over-reached,
his Hope of improving a Sum, and his Fear of falling into Want, directed
to their proper Objects; they would make so many different <i>Christian</i>
Graces and Virtues. He may apply to himself a great Part of St. <i>Paul's</i>
Catalogue of Sufferings. <i>In journeying often; in Perils of Water, in
Perils of Robbers, in Perils among false Brethren. In Weariness and
Painfulness, in Watchings often, in Hunger and Thirst, in Fastings
often,</i>&mdash;At how much less Expence might he <i>lay up to himself Treasures
in Heaven</i>; or if I may, in this Place, be allowed to add the Saying of
a great Philosopher, he may <i>provide such Possessions, as fear neither
Arms, nor Men, nor</i> Jove <i>himself.</i><br>
<br>
In the second Place, if we look upon the Toils of Ambition, in the same
Light as we have considered those of Avarice, we shall readily own that
far less Trouble is requisite to gain lasting Glory, than the Power and
Reputation of a few Years; or, in other Words, we may with more Ease
deserve Honour, than obtain it. The Ambitious Man should remember
Cardinal <i>Woolsey's</i> Complaint.

<blockquote><i>  'Had I served God, with the same Application, wherewith I served my
  King, he would not have forsaken me in my old Age.'</i></blockquote>

The Cardinal here softens his Ambition by the specious Pretence of
<i>serving his King</i>: Whereas his Words in the proper Construction, imply,
that if instead of being acted by Ambition, he had been acted by
Religion, he should have now felt the Comforts of it, when the whole
World turned its Back upon him.<br>
<br>
<i>Thirdly</i>, Let us compare the Pains of the Sensual, with those of the
Virtuous, and see which are heavier in the Balance. It may seem strange,
at the first View, that the Men of Pleasure should be advised to change
their Course, because they lead a painful Life. Yet when we see them so
active and vigilant in quest of Delight; under so many Disquiets, and
the Sport of such various Passions; let them answer, as they can, if the
Pains they undergo, do not outweigh their Enjoyments. The Infidelities
on the one Part between the two Sexes, and the Caprices on the other,
the Debasement of Reason, the Pangs of Expectation, the Disappointments
in Possession, the Stings of Remorse, the Vanities and Vexations
attending even the most refined Delights that make up this Business of
Life, render it so silly and uncomfortable, that no Man is thought wise
till he hath got over it, or happy, but in proportion as he hath cleared
himself from it.<br>
<br>
The Sum of all is this. Man is made an active Being. Whether he walks in
the Paths of Virtue or Vice, he is sure to meet with many Difficulties
to prove his Patience, and excite his Industry. The same if not greater
Labour, is required in the Service of Vice and Folly, as of Virtue and
Wisdom: And he hath this easie Choice left him, whether with the
Strength he is Master of, he will purchase Happiness or Repentance.<br>

The <i>Love Casuist</i> hath referred to me the following Letter of Queries,
with his Answers to each Question, for my Approbation. I have
accordingly consider'd the several Matters therein contained, and hereby
confirm and ratifie his Answers, and require the gentle Querist to
conform her self thereunto.<br>

<blockquote>  <i><b>Sir</b> </i>,<br>
<br>
  'I was Thirteen the Ninth of November last, and must now begin to
  think of settling my self in the World, and so I would humbly beg your
  Advice, what I must do with Mr. <i>Fondle</i>, who makes his Addresses to
  me. He is a very pretty Man, and hath the blackest Eyes and whitest
  Teeth you ever saw. Though he is but a younger Brother, he dresses
  like a Man of Quality, and no Body comes into a Room like him. I know
  he hath refused great Offers, and if he cannot Marry me, he will never
  have any Body else. But my Father hath forbid him the House, because
  he sent me a Copy of Verses; for he is one of the greatest Wits in
  Town. My eldest Sister, who, with her good Will, would call me <i>Miss</i>
  as long as I live, must be married before me, they say. She tells
  them, that Mr. <i>Fondle</i> makes a Fool of me, and will spoil the Child,
  as she calls me, like a confident thing as she is. In short, I am
  resolved to marry Mr. <i>Fondle</i>, if it be but to spite her. But because
  I would do nothing that is imprudent, I beg of you to give me your
  Answers to some Questions I will write down, and de<b>Sir</b> e you to get
  them printed in the SPECTATOR, and I do not doubt but you will give
  such Advice, as, I am sure, I shall follow.<br>
<br>
  'When Mr. <i>Fondle</i> looks upon me for half an Hour together, and calls
  me <i>Angel</i>, is he not in Love?<br>
<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer, No.<br>
<br>
  'May not I be certain he will be a kind Husband, that has promised me
  half my Portion in Pin-money, and to keep me a Coach and Six in the
  Bargain.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  No.<br>
<br>
  'Whether I, who have been acquainted with him this whole Year almost,
  am not a better Judge of his Merit, than my Father and Mother, who
  never heard him talk, but at Table?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  No.<br>
<br>
  'Whether I am not old enough to chuse for my self?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  No.<br>
<br>
  'Whether it would not have been rude in me to refuse a Lock of his
  Hair?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  No.<br>
<br>
  'Shou'd not I be a very barbarous Creature, if I did not pity a Man
  that is always Sighing for my Sake?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  No.<br>
<br>
  'Whether you would not advise me to run away with the poor Man?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  No.<br>
<br>
'Whether you do not think, that if I won't have him, he won't drown
  himself?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  No.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  What shall I say to him the next time he asks me if I will marry him?<br>

  No.

<blockquote>  <i>Mr.</i> SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  I wonder that in the present Situation of Affairs, you can take
  Pleasure in writing any thing but News; for, in a Word, who minds any
  thing else? The Pleasure of increasing in Knowledge, and learning
  something new every Hour of Life, is the noblest Entertainment of a
  Rational Creature. I have a very good Ear for a Secret, and am
  naturally of a communicative Temper; by which Means I am capable of
  doing you great Services in this way. In order to make my self useful,
  I am early in the Antichamber, where I thrust my Head into the thick
  of the Press, and catch the News, at the opening of the Door, while it
  is warm. Sometimes I stand by the Beef-Eaters, and take the Buz as it
  passes by me. At other times I lay my Ear close to the Wall, and suck
  in many a valuable Whisper, as it runs in a streight Line from Corner
  to Corner. When I am weary with standing, I repair to one of the
  neighbouring Coffee-houses, where I sit sometimes for a whole Day, and
  have the News as it comes from Court fresh and fresh. In short, <b>Sir</b> , I
  spare no Pains to know how the World goes. A Piece of News loses its
  Flavour when it hath been an Hour in the Air. I love, if I may so
  speak, to have it fresh from the Tree; and to convey it to my Friends
  before it is faded. Accordingly my Expences in Coach-hire make no
  small Article; which you may believe, when I assure you, that I post
  away from Coffee-house to Coffee-house, and forestall the
  <i>Evening-Post</i> by two Hours. There is a certain Gentleman who hath
  given me the slip twice or thrice, and hath been beforehand with me at
  <i>Child's.</i> But I have play'd him a Trick. I have purchas'd a pair of
  the best Coach-horses I could buy for Money, and now let him out-strip
  me if he can. Once more, Mr. SPECTATOR, let me advise you to deal in
  News. You may depend upon my Assistance. But I must break off
  abruptly, for I have twenty Letters to write.<br>

I <a name="fr6261">have</a> seen a little Work of a learned Man<a href="#f6261"><sup>1</sup></a>, consisting of
extemporary Speculations, which owed their Birth to the most trifling
Occurrences of Life. His usual Method was, to write down any sudden
Start of Thought which arose in his Mind upon the sight of an odd
Gesticulation in a Man, any whimsical Mimickry of Reason in a Beast, or
whatever appeared remarkable in any Object of the visible Creation. He
was able to moralize upon a Snuff-Box, would flourish eloquently upon a
Tucker or a Pair of Ruffles, and draw practical Inferences from a
full-bottomed Perriwig. This I thought fit to mention, by way of Excuse,
for my ingenious Correspondent, who hath introduced the following Letter
by an Image which, I will beg leave to tell him, is too ridiculous in so
serious and noble a Speculation.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
<blockquote>  <i>Mr.</i> SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'When I have seen young Puss playing her wanton Gambols, and with a
  thousand antick Shapes express her own Gayety at the same time that
  she moved mine, while the old Grannum hath sat by with a most
  exemplary Gravity, unmov'd at all that past; it hath made me reflect
  what should be the occasion of Humours so opposite in two Creatures,
  between whom there was no visible Difference but that of Age; and I
  have been able to resolve it into nothing else but <i>the Force of
  Novelty.</i><br>
<br>
  'In every Species of Creatures, those who have been least Time in the
  World, appear best pleased with their Condition: For, besides that to
  a new Comer the World hath a Freshness on it that strikes the Sense
  after a most agreeable Manner, <i>Being</i> it self, unattended with any
  great Variety of Enjoyments, excites a Sensation of Pleasure. But as
  Age advances, every thing seems to wither, the Senses are disgusted
  with their old Entertainments, and Existence turns flat and insipid.
  We may see this exemplified in Mankind: The Child, let him be free
  from Pain, and gratified in his Change of Toys, is diverted with the
  smallest Trifle. Nothing disturbs the Mirth of the Boy, but a little
  Punishment or Confinement. The Youth must have more violent Pleasures
  to employ his Time; the Man loves the Hurry of an active Life, devoted
  to the Pursuits of Wealth or Ambition; and Lastly, old Age, having
  lost its Capacity for these Avocations, becomes its own insupportable
  Burthen. This Variety may in part be accounted for by the Vivacity and
  Decay of the Faculties; but I believe is chiefly owing to this, That
  the longer we have been in Possession of Being, the less sensible is
  the Gust we have of it; and the more it requires of adventitious
  Amusements to relieve us from the Satiety and Weariness it brings
  along with it.<br>
<br>
  'And as Novelty is of a very powerful, so of a most extensive
  influence. Moralists have long since observed it to be the Source of
  Admiration, which lessens in proportion to our Familiarity with
  Objects, and upon a thorough Acquaintance is utterly extinguished. But
  I think it hath not been so commonly remarked, that all the other
  Passions depend considerably on the same Circumstance. What is it but
  Novelty that awakens De<b>Sir</b> e, enhances Delight, kindles Anger, provokes
  Envy, inspires Horror? To this Cause we must ascribe it, that Love
  languishes with Fruition, and Friendship it self is recommended by
  Intervals of Absence: Hence Monsters, by use, are beheld without
  loathing, and the most enchanting Beauty without Rapture. That Emotion
  of the Spirits in which Passion consists, is usually the Effect of
  Surprize, and as long as it continues, heightens the agreeable or
  disagreeable Qualities of its Object; but as this Emotion ceases (and
  it ceases with the Novelty) things appear in another Light, and
  affects us even less than might be expected from their proper Energy,
  for having moved us too much before.<br>
<br>
  'It may not be an useless Enquiry how far the Love of Novelty is the
  unavoidable Growth of Nature, and in what Respects it is peculiarly
  adapted to the present State. To me it seems impossible, that a
  reasonable Creature should rest absolutely satisfied in any
  Acquisitions whatever, without endeavouring farther; for after its
  highest Improvements, the Mind hath an Idea of an Infinity of things
  still behind worth knowing, to the Knowledge of which therefore it
  cannot be indifferent; as by climbing up a Hill in the midst of a wide
  Plain, a Man hath his Prospect enlarged, and, together with that, the
  Bounds of his De<b>Sir</b> es. Upon this Account, I cannot think he detracts
  from the State of the Blessed, who conceives them to be perpetually
  employed in fresh Searches into Nature, and to Eternity advancing into
  the fathomless Depths of the Divine Perfections. In this Thought there
  is nothing but what doth Honour to these glorified Spirits; provided
  still it be remembred, that their De<b>Sir</b> e of more proceeds not from
  their disrelishing what they possess; and the Pleasure of a new
  Enjoyment is not with them measured by its Novelty (which is a thing
  merely foreign and accidental) but by its real intrinsick Value. After
  an Acquaintance of many thousand Years with the Works of God, the
  Beauty and Magnificence of the Creation fills them with the same
  pleasing Wonder and profound Awe, which <i>Adam</i> felt himself seized
  with as he first opened his Eyes upon this glorious Scene. Truth
  captivates with unborrowed Charms, and whatever hath once given
  Satisfaction will always do it: In all which they have manifestly the
  Advantage of us, who are so much govern'd by sickly and changeable
  Appetites, that we can with the greatest Coldness behold the
  stupendous Displays of Omnipotence, and be in Transports at the puny
  Essays of humane Skill; throw aside Speculations of the sublimest
  Nature and vastest Importance into some obscure Corner of the Mind, to
  make Room for new Notions of no Consequence at all; are even tired of
  Health, because not enlivened with alternate Pain, and prefer the
  first Reading of an indifferent Author, to the second or third Perusal
  of one whose Merit and Reputation are established.<br>
<br>
  Our being thus formed serves many useful Purposes in the present
  State. It contributes not a little to the Advancement of Learning;
  for, as <i>Cicero</i> takes Notice, That which makes Men willing to undergo
  the Fatigues of Philosophical Disquisitions, is not so much the
  Greatness of Objects as their Novelty. It is not enough that there is
  Field and Game for the Chace, and that the Understanding is prompted
  with a restless Thirst of Knowledge, effectually to rouse the Soul,
  sunk into the State of Sloth and Indolence; it is also necessary that
  there be an uncommon Pleasure annexed to the first Appearance of Truth
  in the Mind. This Pleasure being exquisite for the Time it lasts, but
  transient, it hereby comes to pass that the Mind grows into an
  Indifference to its former Notions, and passes on after new
  Discoveries, in hope of repeating the Delight. It is with Knowledge as
  with Wealth, the Pleasure of which lies more in making endless
  Additions, than in taking a Review of our old Store. There are some
  Inconveniencies that follow this Temper, if not guarded against,
  particularly this, that through a too great Eagerness of something new
  we are many times impatient of staying long enough upon a Question
  that requires some time to resolve it, or, which is worse, perswade
  our selves that we are Masters of the Subject before we are so, only
  to be at the Liberty of going upon a fresh Scent; in Mr. <i>Lock's</i>
  Words, <i>We see a little, presume a great deal, and so jump to the
  Conclusion.</i><br>
<br>
  'A farther Advantage of our Inclination for Novelty, as at present
  circumstantiated, is, that it annihilates all the boasted Distinctions
  among Mankind. Look not up with Envy to those above thee. Sounding
  Titles, stately Buildings, fine Gardens, gilded Chariots, rich
  Equipages, what are they? They dazzle every one but the Possessor: To
  him that is accustomed to them they are cheap and regardless Things:
  They supply him not with brighter Images, or more sublime
  Satisfactions than the plain Man may have, whose small Estate will
  just enable him to support the Charge of a simple unencumbered Life.
  He enters heedless into his Rooms of State, as you or I do under our
  poor Sheds. The noble Paintings and costly Furniture are lost on him;
  he sees them not: As how can it be otherwise, when by Custom, a
  Fabrick infinitely more grand and finish'd, that of the Universe,
  stands unobserved by the Inhabitants, and the everlasting Lamps of
  Heaven are lighted up in vain, for any Notice that Mortals take of
  them? Thanks to indulgent Nature, which not only placed her Children
  originally upon a Level, but still, by the Strength of this Principle,
  in a great Measure preserves it, in spite of all the Care of a Man, to
  introduce artificial Distinctions.<br>
<br>
  'To add no more, Is not this Fondness for Novelty, which makes us out
  of Conceit with all we already have, a convincing Proof of a future
  State? Either Man was made in vain, or this is not the only World he
  was made for: For there cannot be a greater Instance of Vanity, than
  that to which Man is liable, to be deluded from the Cradle to the
  Grave with fleeting Shadows of Happiness. His Pleasures, and those not
  considerable neither, die in the Possession, and fresh Enjoyments do
  not rise fast enough to fill up half his Life with Satisfaction. When
  I see Persons sick of themselves any longer than they are called away
  by something that is of Force to chain down the present Thought; when
  I see them hurry from Country to Town, and then from the Town back
  again into the Country, continually shifting Postures, and placing
  Life in all the different Lights they can think of; <i>Surely</i>, say I to
  my self, <i>Life is vain, and the Man beyond Expression stupid or
  prejudic'd, who from the Vanity of Life cannot gather, He is designed
  for Immortality.</i></blockquote><br>

The following Account, which came to my Hands some time ago, may be no
disagreeable Entertainment to such of my Readers, as have tender Hearts
and nothing to do.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <i>Mr.</i> SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'A Friend of mine died of a Feaver last Week, which he caught by
  walking too late in a dewy Evening amongst his Reapers. I must inform
  you that his greatest Pleasure was in Husbandry and Gardening. He had
  some Humours which seemed inconsistent with that good Sense he was
  otherwise Master of. His Uneasiness in the Company of Women was very
  remarkable in a Man of such perfect Good-breeding, and his avoiding
  one particular Walk in his Garden, where he had used to pass the
  greatest Part of his Time, raised abundance of idle Conjectures in the
  Village where he lived. Upon looking over his Papers we found out the
  Reason, which he never intimated to his nearest Friends. He was, it
  seems, a passionate Lover in his Youth, of which a large Parcel of
  Letters he left behind him are a Witness. I send you a Copy of the
  last he ever wrote upon that Subject, by which you will find that he
  concealed the true Name of his Mistress under that of <i>Zelinda.</i>

<blockquote><i>A long Month's Absence would be insupportable to me, if the
    Business I am employed in were not for the Service of my</i> Zelinda,
    <i>and of such a Nature as to place her every Moment in my Mind. I have
    furnished the House exactly according to your Fancy, or, if you
    please, my own; for I have long since learned to like nothing but
    what you do. The Apartment designed for your Use is so exact a Copy
    of that which you live in, that I often think my self in your House
    when I step into it, but sigh when I find it without its proper
    Inhabitant. You will have the most delicious Prospect from your
    Closet-window that</i> England <i>affords: I am sure I should think it
    so, if the Landskip that shows such Variety did not at the same time
    suggest to me the Greatness of the Space that lies between us.<br>
<br>
    The Gardens are laid out very beautifully; I have dressed up every
    Hedge in Woodbines, sprinkled Bowers and Arbours in every Corner,
    and made a little Paradise round me; yet I am still like the first
    Man in his Solitude, but half blest without a Partner in my
    Happiness. I have directed one Walk to be made for two Persons,
    where I promise ten thousand Satisfactions to my self in your
    Conversation. I already take my Evening's Turn in it, and have worn
    a Path upon the Edge of this little Alley, while I soothed my self
    with the Thought of your walking by my Side. I have held many
    imaginary Discourses with you in this Retirement; and when I have
    been weary have sat down with you in the midst of a Row of
    Jessamines. The many Expressions of Joy and Rapture I use in these
    silent Conversations have made me for some Time the Talk of the
    Parish; but a neighbouring young Fellow, who makes Love to the
    Farmer's Daughter, hath found me out, and made my Case known to the
    whole Neighbourhood.<br>
<br>
    In planting of the Fruit-Trees I have not forgot the Peach you are
    so fond of. I have made a Walk of Elms along the River Side, and
    intend to sow all the Place about it with Cowslips, which I hope you
    will like as well as that I have heard you talk of by your Father's
    House in the Country.<br>
<br>
    Oh!</i> Zelinda, <i>What a Scheme of Delight have I drawn up in my
    Imagination! What Day-Dreams do I indulge my self in! When will the
    Six Weeks be at an End, that lye between me and my promised
    Happiness?<br>
<br>
    How could you break off so abruptly in your last, and tell me you
    must go and dress for the Play? If you loved as I do, you would find
    no more Company in a Crowd, than I have in my Solitude.</i>

    I am, <i>&amp;c.</i></blockquote>

  'On the Back of this Letter is written, in the Hand of the Deceased,
  the following Piece of History. 

<blockquote>    Mem. <i>Having waited a whole Week for an Answer to this Letter, I
    hurried to Town, where I found the Perfidious Creature married to my
    Rival. I will bear it as becomes a Man, and endeavour to find out
    Happiness for my self in that Retirement, which I had prepared in
    vain for a false ungrateful Woman.</i></blockquote>

  'There <a name="fr6281">are</a> none of your Speculations which please me more than those
  upon Infinitude and Eternity<a href="#f6281"><sup>1</sup></a>. You have already considered that
  Part of Eternity which is past, and I wish you would give us your
  Thoughts upon that which is to come.<br>
<br>
  'Your Readers will perhaps receive greater Pleasure from this View of
  Eternity than the former, since we have every one of us a Concern in
  that which is to come: Whereas a Speculation on that which is past is
  rather curious than useful.<br>
<br>
  'Besides, we can easily conceive it possible for successive Duration
  never to have an End; tho', as you have justly observed, that Eternity
  which never had a Beginning is altogether incomprehensible; That is,
  we can conceive an Eternal Duration which <i>may be</i>, though we cannot
  an Eternal Duration which <i>hath been</i>; or, if I may use the
  Philosophical Terms, we may apprehend a <i>Potential</i> though not an
  <i>Actual</i> Eternity.<br>
<br>
  'This Notion of a future Eternity, which is natural to the Mind of
  Man, is an unanswerable Argument that he is a Being designed for it;
  especially if we consider that he is capable of being Virtuous or
  Vicious here; that he hath Faculties improvable to all Eternity, and
  by a proper or wrong Employment of them, may be happy or miserable
  throughout that infinite Duration. Our Idea indeed of this Eternity is
  not of an adequate or fixed Nature, but is perpetually growing and
  enlarging itself toward the Object, which is too big for human
  Comprehension. As we are now in the Beginnings of Existence, so shall
  we always appear to our selves as if we were for ever entring upon it.
  After a Million or two of Centuries, some considerable Things, already
  past, may slip out of our Memory; which, if it be not strengthened in
  a wonderful Manner, may possibly forget that ever there was a Sun or
  Planets. And yet, notwithstanding the long Race that we shall then
  have run, we shall still imagine ourselves just starting from the
  Goal, and find no Proportion between that Space which we know had a
  Beginning, and what we are sure will never have an End.<br>
<br>
  'But I shall leave this Subject to your Management, and question not
  but you will throw it into such Lights as shall at once improve and
  entertain your Reader.<br>
<br>
  'I <a name="fr6282">have</a> enclos'd sent you a Translation<a href="#f6282"><sup>2</sup></a> of the Speech of <i>Cato</i> on
  this Occasion, which hath accidentally fallen into my Hands, and which
  for Conciseness, Purity, and Elegance of Phrase, cannot be
  sufficiently admired.

Next to the People who want a Place, there are none to be pitied more
than those who are solicited for one. A plain Answer, with a Denial in
it, is looked upon as Pride, and a civil Answer as a Promise.<br>
<br>
Nothing is more ridiculous than the Pretensions of People upon these
Occasions. Every thing a Man hath suffered, whilst his Enemies were in
play, was certainly brought about by the Malice of the opposite Party. A
bad Cause would not have been lost, if such an one had not been upon the
Bench; nor a profligate Youth disinherited, if he had not got drunk
every Night by toasting an outed Ministry. I remember a Tory, who having
been fined in a Court of Justice for a Prank that deserved the Pillory,
de<b>Sir</b> 'd upon the Merit of it to be made a Justice of Peace when his
Friends came into Power; and shall never forget a Whig Criminal, who,
upon being indicted for a Rape, told his Friends, <i>You see what a Man
suffers for sticking to his Principles.</i><br>
<br>
The Truth of it is, the Sufferings of a Man in a Party are of a very
doubtful Nature. When they are such as have promoted a good Cause, and
fallen upon a Man undeservedly, they have a Right to be heard and
recompensed beyond any other Pretensions. But when they rise out of
Rashness or Indiscretion, and the Pursuit of such Measures as have
rather ruined, than promoted the Interest they aim at, (which hath
always been the Case of many great Sufferers) they only serve to
recommend them to the Children of Violence or Folly.<br>
<br>
I have by me a Bundle of Memorials presented by several Cavaliers upon
the Restauration of K. <i>Charles</i> II. which may serve as so many
Instances, to our present Purpose.<br>
<br>
Among several Persons and Pretensions recorded by my Author, he mentions
one of a very great Estate, who, for having roasted an Ox whole, and
distributed a Hogshead upon K. <i>Charles's</i> Birth-day, de<b>Sir</b> ed to be
provided for, as his Majesty in his great Wisdom shall think fit.<br>
<br>
Another put in to be Prince <i>Henry's</i>, Governor, for having dared to
drink his Health in the worst of Times.<br>
<br>
A Third petitioned for a Colonel's Commission, for having Cursed <i>Oliver
Cromwell</i>, the Day before his Death, on a publick Bowling-Green.<br>
<br>
But the most whimsical Petition I have met with is that of <i>B. B.</i> Esq.,
who de<b>Sir</b> 'd the Honour of Knighthood, for having Cuckolded <b>Sir</b>  <i>T. W.</i> a
notorious <i>Roundhead.</i><br>
<br>
There is likewise the Petition of one, who having let his Beard grow
from the Martyrdom of K. <i>Charles</i> the First, till the Restauration of
K. <i>Charles</i> the Second, de<b>Sir</b> ed, in Consideration thereof, to be made a
Privy-Counsellor.<br>
<br>
I must not omit a Memorial setting forth, that the Memorialist had, with
great dispatch, carried a Letter from a certain Lord to a certain Lord,
wherein, as it afterwards appeared, Measures were concerted for the
Restauration, and without which he verily believes that happy Revolution
had never been effected; who thereupon humbly prays to be made
Post-Master-General.<br>
<br>
A certain Gentleman, who seems to write with a great deal of Spirit, and
uses the Words <i>Gallantry</i> and <i>Gentleman-like</i> very often in his
Petition, begs that (in Consideration of his having worn his Hat for ten
Years past in the Loyal Cavalier-Cock, to his great Danger and
Detriment) he may be made a Captain of the Guards.<br>
<br>
I shall close my Account of this Collection of Memorials, with the Copy
of one Petition at length, which I recommend to my Reader as a very
valuable Piece.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote>  <i>The Petition of E. H. Esq., humbly Sheweth,</i><br>
<br>
  'That your Petitioner's Father's Brother's Uncle, Colonel <i>W. H.</i> lost
  the Third Finger of his Left Hand at <i>Edge-hill</i> Fight.<br>
<br>
  'That your Petitioner, notwithstanding the Smallness of his Fortune,
  (he being a younger Brother) always kept Hospitality, and drank
  Confusion to the Roundheads in half a Score Bumpers every <i>Sunday</i> in
  the Year, as several honest Gentlemen (whose Names are underwritten)
  are ready to testifie.<br>
<br>
  'That your Petitioner is remarkable in his Country for having dared to
  treat <b>Sir</b>  <i>P. P.</i> a cursed Sequestrator, and three Members of the
  Assembly of Divines, with Brawn and Minced Pies upon <i>New Year's</i> Day.<br>
<br>
  'That your said humble Petitioner hath been five times imprisoned in
  five several County-Goals, for having been a Ring-leader in five
  different Riots; into which his Zeal for the Royal Cause hurried him,
  when men of greater Estates had not the Courage to rise.<br>
<br>
  'That he, the said <i>E. H.</i> hath had six Duels and four and twenty
  Boxing-Matches in Defence of his Majesty's Title; and that he received
  such a Blow upon the Head at a Bonfire in <i>Stratford</i> upon <i>Avon</i>, as
  he hath been never the better for from that Day to this.<br>
<br>
  'That your Petitioner hath been so far from improving his Fortune, in
  the late damnable Times, that he verily believes, and hath good Reason
  to imagine, that if he had been Master of an Estate, he had infallibly
  been plundered and sequestred.<br>
<br>
  'Your Petitioner, in Consideration of his said Merits and Sufferings,
  humbly requests that he may have the Place of Receiver of the Taxes,
  Collector of the Customs, Clerk of the Peace, Deputy Lieutenant, or
  whatsoever else he shall be thought qualified for.<br>

Having no spare Time to write any thing of my own, or to correct what is
sent me by others, I have thought fit to publish the following Letters.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
<blockquote>  <i>Oxford, November</i> 22.<br>
<br>
  <i><b>Sir</b> </i>,
<br>
  'If you would be so kind to me, as to suspend that Satisfaction, which
  the Learned World must receive in reading one of your Speculations, by
  publishing this Endeavour, you will very much oblige and improve one,
  who has the Boldness to hope, that he may be admitted into the number
  of your Correspondents.<br>
<br>
  'I have often wondered to hear Men of good Sense and good Nature
  profess a Dislike to Musick, when, at the same time, they do not
  scruple to own, that it has the most agreeable and improving
  Influences over their Minds: It seems to me an unhappy Contradiction,
  that those Persons should have an Indifference for an Art, which
  raises in them such a Variety of sublime Pleasures.<br>
<br>
  'However, though some few, by their own or the unreasonable Prejudices
  of others, may be led into a Distaste for those Musical Societies
  which are erected merely for Entertainment, yet sure I may venture to
  say, that no one can have the least Reason for Disaffection to that
  solemn kind of Melody which consists of the Praises of our Creator.<br>
<br>
  'You have, I presume, already prevented me in an Argument upon this
  Occasion (which some Divines have successfully advanced upon a much
  greater) that Musical Sacrifice and Adoration has claimed a Place in
  the Laws and Customs of the most different Nations; As the <i>Grecians</i>
  and <i>Romans</i> of the Prophane, the <i>Jews</i> and <i>Christians</i> of the
  Sacred World did as unanimously agree in this, as they disagreed in
  all other Parts of their &oelig;conomy.<br>
<br>
  'I know there are not wanting some who are of Opinion that the pompous
  kind of Musick which is in Use in foreign Churches is the most
  excellent, as it most affects our Senses. But I am swayed by my
  Judgment to the Modesty which is observed in the musical Part of our
  Devotions. Methinks there is something very laudable in the Custom of
  a <i>Voluntary</i> before the first Lesson; by this we are supposed to be
  prepared for the Admission of those Divine Truths, which we are
  shortly to receive. We are then to cast all worldly Regards from off
  our Hearts, all Tumults within are then becalmed, and there should be
  nothing near the Soul but Peace and Tranquility. So that in this short
  Office of Praise, the Man is raised above himself, and is almost lost
  already amidst the Joys of Futurity.<br>
<br>
  'I have heard some nice Observers frequently commend the Policy of our
  Church in this Particular, that it leads us on by such easie and
  regular Methods, that we are perfectly deceived into Piety. When the
  Spirits begin to languish (as they too often do) with a constant
  Series of Petitions, she takes care to allow them a pious Respite, and
  relieves them with the Raptures of an Anthem. Nor can we doubt that
  the sublimest Poetry, softened in the most moving Strains of Musick,
  can ever fail of humbling or exalting the Soul to any Pitch of
  Devotion. Who can hear the Terrors of the Lord of Hosts described in
  the most expressive Melody, without being awed into a Veneration? or
  who can hear the kind and endearing Attributes of a merciful Father,
  and not be softened into Love towards him!<br>
<br>
  'As the rising and sinking of the Passions, the casting soft or noble
  Hints into the Soul, is the natural Privilege of Musick in general, so
  more particularly of that kind which is employed at the Altar. Those
  Impressions which it leaves upon the Spirits are more deep and
  lasting, as the Grounds from which it receives its Authority are
  founded more upon Reason. It diffuses a Calmness all around us, it
  makes us drop all those vain or immodest <a name="fr6301">Thoughts</a> which would be an
  hindrance to us in the Performance of that great Duty of Thanksgiving<a href="#f6301"><sup>1</sup></a>, which, as we are informed by our Almighty Benefactor, is the most
  acceptable Return which can be made for those infinite Stores of
  Blessings which he daily condescends to pour down upon his Creatures.
  When we make Use of this pathetical Method of addressing our selves to
  him, we can scarce contain from Raptures! The Heart is warmed with a
  Sublimity of Goodness. We are all Piety and all Love!<br>
<br>
  'How do the Blessed Spirits rejoice and wonder to behold unthinking
  Man prostrating his Soul to his dread Sovereign in such a Warmth of
  Piety as they themselves might not be ashamed of!<br>
<br>
  'I shall close these Reflections with a Passage taken out of the Third
  Book of <i>Milton's Paradise Lost,</i> where those harmonious Beings are
  thus nobly described.

<blockquote><i>Then Crown'd again, their Gold'n Harps they took,<br>
Harps ever tun'd, that glittering by their side<br>
Like Quivers hung, and with Preamble sweet<br>
Of Charming Symphony they introduce<br>
The Sacred Song, and waken Raptures high;<br>
No one exempt, no Voice but well could join<br>
Melodious part, such Concord is in Heav'n</i></blockquote><br>

<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
  <i>Mr.</i> SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'The Town cannot be unacquainted, that in divers Parts of it there are
  vociferous Setts of Men who are called <i>Rattling Clubs</i>; but what
  shocks me most is, they have now the Front to invade the Church and
  institute these Societies there, as a Clan of them have in late times
  done, to such a degree of Insolence, as has given the Partition where
  they reside in a Church near one of the City Gates, the Denomination
  of the <i>Rattling Pew</i>. These gay Fellows, from humble Lay Professions,
  set up for Criticks without any Tincture of Letters or Reading, and
  have the Vanity to think they can lay hold of something from the
  Parson, which may be formed into Ridicule.<br>
<br>
  'It is needless to observe, that the Gentlemen who every <i>Sunday</i> have
  the hard Province of Instructing these Wretches in a way they are in
  no present Disposition to take, have a fixt Character for Learning and
  Eloquence, not to be tainted by the weak Efforts of this Contemptible
  Part of their Audiences. Whether the Pulpit is taken by these
  Gentlemen, or any Strangers their Friends, the way of the Club is
  this: If any Sentiments are delivered too Sublime for their
  Conception; if any uncommon Topick is entered on, or one in use new
  modified with the finest Judgment and Dexterity; or any controverted
  Point be never so elegantly handled; In short whatever surpasses the
  narrow Limits of their Theology, or is not suited to their Taste, they
  are all immediately upon their Watch, fixing their Eyes upon each
  other, with as much Warmth as our Gladiators of <i>Hockley in the Hole</i>,
  and waiting like them for a Hit; if one touches, all take Fire, and
  their Noddles instantly meet in the Centre of the Pew; then, as by
  beat of Drum, with exact Discipline, they rear up into a full length
  of Stature, and with odd Looks and Gesticulations confer together in
  so loud and clamorous a manner, continued to the close of the
  Discourse, and during the After-Psalm, as is not to be silenced but by
  the Bells. Nor does this suffice them, without aiming to propagate
  their Noise through all the Church, by Signals given to the adjoyning
  Seats, where others designed for this Fraternity are sometimes placed
  upon Tryal to receive them.<br>
<br>
  'The Folly as well as Rudeness of this Practice is in nothing more
  conspicuous than this, that all that follows in the Sermon is lost;
  for whenever our Sparks take alarm, they blaze out and grow so
  Tumultuous that no After-Explanation can avail, it being impossible
  for themselves or any near them to give an Account thereof. If any
  thing really Novel is advanced, how averse soever it may be to their
  way of thinking, to say nothing of Duty, Men of less Levity than these
  would be led by a natural Curiosity to hear the whole.<br>
<br>
  'Laughter, where things Sacred are transacted, is far less pardonable
  than Whining at a Conventicle; the last has at least a Semblance of
  Grace, and where the Affectation is unseen may possibly imprint
  wholesome Lessons on the Sincere; but the first has no Excuse,
  breaking through all the Rules of Order and Decency, and manifesting a
  Remissness of Mind in those important Matters, which require the
  strictest Composure and Steadiness of Thought; A Proof of the greatest
  Folly in the World.<br>
<br>
  'I shall not here enter upon the Veneration due to the Sanctity of the
  Place, the Reverence owing to the Minister, or the Respect that so
  great an Assembly as a whole Parish may justly claim. I shall only
  tell them, that as the <i>Spanish</i> Cobler, to reclaim a profligate Son,
  bid him <i>have some regard to the Dignity of his Family</i>, so they as
  Gentlemen (for we Citizens assume to be such one Day in a Week) are
  bound for the future to Repent of, and Abstain from, the gross Abuses
  here mentioned, whereof they have been Guilty in Contempt of Heaven
  and Earth, and contrary to the Laws in this Case made and provided.<br>

<br>

I had occasion to go a few Miles out of Town, some Days since, in a
Stage-Coach, where I had for my Fellow-Tavellers a dirty Beau, and a
pretty young Quaker-Woman. Having no Inclination to Talk much at that
time, I placed my self backward, with a design to survey them, and pick
a Speculation out of my two Companions. Their different Figures were
sufficient of themselves to draw my Attention. The Gentleman was dressed
in a Suit, the Ground whereof had been Black, as I perceived from some
few Spaces, that had escaped the Powder, <a name="fr6311">which</a> was Incorporated with the
greatest part of his Coat: His Perriwig, which cost no small Sum<a href="#f6311"><sup>1</sup></a>,
was after so slovenly a manner cast over his Shoulders, that it seemed
not to have been combed since the Year 1712; his Linnen, which was not
much concealed, was daubed with plain <i>Spanish</i> from the Chin to the
lowest Button, and the Diamond upon his Finger (which naturally dreaded
the Water) put me in Mind how it sparkled amidst the Rubbish of the
Mine, where it was first discovered. On the other hand, the pretty
Quaker appeared in all the Elegance of Cleanliness. Not a Speck was to
be found on her. A clear, clean oval Face, just edged about with little
thin Plaits of the purest Cambrick, received great Advantages from the
Shade of her black Hood; as did the Whiteness of her Arms from that
sober-coloured Stuff, in which she had Cloathed her self. The Plainness
of her Dress was very well suited to the Simplicity of her Phrases; all
which put together, though they could not give me a great Opinion of her
Religion, they did of her Innocence.<br>
<br>
This Adventure occasioned my throwing together a few hints upon
<i>Cleanliness</i>, which I shall consider as one of the <i>Half-Virtues</i>, as
<i>Aristotle</i> calls them, and shall recommend it under the three following
Heads, As it is a Mark of Politeness; As it produces Love; and As it
bears Analogy to Purity of Mind.<br>
<br>
<i>First</i>, It is a Mark of Politeness. It is universally agreed upon, that
no one, unadorn'd with this Virtue, can go into Company without giving a
manifest Offence. The easier or higher any one's Fortune is, this Duty
arises proportionably. The different Nations of the World are as much
distinguished by their Cleanliness, as by their Arts and Sciences. The
more any Country is civilized, the more they consult this part of
Politeness. We need but compare our Ideas of a Female <i>Hottentot</i> and an
<i>English</i> Beauty, to be satisfied of the Truth of what hath been
advanced.<br>
<br>
In the next Place, Cleanliness may be said to be the Foster-Mother of
Love. Beauty indeed most commonly produces that Passion in the Mind, but
Cleanliness preserves it. An indifferent Face and Person, kept in
perpetual Neatness, had won many a Heart from a pretty Slattern. Age it
self is not unamiable, while it is preserved clean and unsullied: Like a
piece of Metal constantly kept smooth and bright, we look on it with
more Pleasure than on a new Vessel that is canker'd with Rust.<br>
<br>
I might observe farther, that as Cleanliness renders us agreeable to
others, so it makes us easie to our selves; that it is an excellent
Preservative of Health; and that several Vices, destructive both to Mind
and Body, are inconsistent with the Habit of it. But these Reflections I
shall leave to the Leisure of my Readers, and shall observe in the Third
Place, that it bears a great Analogy with Purity of Mind, and naturally
inspires refined Sentiments and Passions.<br>
<br>
We find from Experience, that through the Prevalence of Custom, the most
vicious Actions lose their Horror, by being made familiar to us. On the
contrary, those who live in the Neighbourhood of good Examples, fly from
the first Appearances of what is shocking. It fares with us much after
the same Manner, as to our Ideas. Our Senses, which are the Inlets to
all the Images conveyed to the Mind, can only transmit the Impression of
such things as usually surround them. So that pure and unsullied
Thoughts are naturally suggested to the Mind, by those Objects that
perpetually encompass us, when they are beautiful and elegant in their
kind.<br>
<br>
In the East, where the Warmth of the Climate makes Cleanliness more
immediately necessary than in colder Countries, it is made one Part of
their Religion: The <i>Jewish</i> Law, (and the <i>Mahometan</i>, which in some
things copies after it) is filled with Bathings, Purifications, and
other Rites of the like Nature. Though there is the above-named
convenient Reason to be assigned for these Ceremonies, the chief
Intention undoubtedly was to typifie inward Purity and Cleanness of
Heart by those outward Washings. We read several Injunctions of this
Kind in the Book of <i>Deuteronomy</i>, which confirm this Truth; and which
are but ill accounted for by saying, as some do, that they were only
instituted for Convenience in the Desart, which otherwise could not have
been habitable for so many Years.<br>
<br>
I shall conclude this Essay, with a Story which I have somewhere read in
an Account of <i>Mahometan</i> Superstitions.<br>
<br>
A <i>Dervise</i> of great Sanctity one Morning had the Misfortune as he took
up a Chrystal Cup, which was consecrated to the Prophet, to let it fall
upon the Ground, and dash it in Pieces. His Son coming in, some time
after, he stretched out his Hands to bless him, as his manner was every
Morning; but the Youth going out stumbled over the Threshold and broke
his Arm. As the old Man wondered at these Events, a Caravan passed by in
its way from <i>Mecca.</i> The <i>Dervise</i> approached it to beg a Blessing; but
as he stroaked one of the Holy Camels, he received a Kick from the
Beast, that sorely bruised him. His Sorrow and Amazement increased upon
him, till he recollected that through Hurry and Inadvertency he had that
Morning come abroad without washing his Hands.<br>

The Love of Symmetry and Order, which is natural to the Mind of Man,
betrays him sometimes into very whimsical Fancies.<i> This noble
Principle,</i> says a <i>French</i> Author, <i>loves to amuse it self on the most
trifling Occasions. You may see a profound Philosopher</i>, says he, <i>walk
for an Hour together in his Chamber, and industriously treading, at
every Step, upon every other Board in the Flooring.</i> Every Reader will
recollect several Instances of this Nature without my Assistance. I
<a name="fr6321">think</a> it was <i>Gregorio Leti</i> who had published as many Books as he was
Years old<a href="#f6321"><sup>1</sup></a>; which was a Rule he had laid down and punctually observed
to the Year of his Death. It was, perhaps, a Thought of the like Nature
which determined <i>Homer</i> himself to divide each of his Poems into as
many Books, as there are Letters in the <i>Greek</i> Alphabet. <i>Herodotus</i>
has in the same manner adapted his Books to the Number of the <i>Muses</i>,
for which Reason many a Learned man hath wished there had been more than
Nine of that Sisterhood.<br>
<br>
Several <i>Epic</i> Poets have religiously followed <i>Virgil</i> as to the Number
of his Books; and even <i>Milton</i> is thought by many to have changed the
Number of his Books from Ten to Twelve, for no other Reason; as <i>Cowley</i>
tells us, it was his Design, had he finished his <i>Davideis</i>, to have
also imitated the <i>&AElig;neid</i> in this Particular. I believe every one will
agree with me, that a Perfection of this Nature hath no Foundation in
Reason; and, with due Respect to these great Names, may be looked upon
as something whimsical.<br>
<br>
I mention these great Examples in Defence of my Bookseller, who
occasioned this Eighth Volume of <i><b>Spectators</b></i>, because, as he said, he
thought Seven a very Odd Number. On the other Side, several grave
Reasons were urged on this important Subject; as in particular, that
Seven was the precise Number of the Wise Men, and that the most
Beautiful Constellation in the Heavens was composed of Seven Stars. This
he allowed to be true, but still insisted, that Seven was an Odd Number;
suggesting at the same time that if he were provided with a sufficient
Stock of leading Papers, he should find Friends ready enough to carry on
the Work. Having by this means got his Vessel launched and set afloat,
he hath committed the Steerage of it, from time to time, to such as he
thought capable of conducting it.<br>
<br>
The Close of this Volume, which the Town may now expect in a little
time, may possibly ascribe each Sheet to its proper Author.<br>
<br>
It were no hard Task to continue this Paper a considerable Time longer,
by the Help of large Contributions sent from unknown Hands.<br>
<br>
I cannot give the Town a better Opinion of the <b>Spectator's</b>
Correspondents, than by publishing the following Letter, with a very
fine Copy of Verses upon a Subject perfectly new.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
<blockquote>  <i>Dublin, Nov.</i> 30, 1714.<br>
<br>
  <i>Mr.</i> SPECTATOR,<br>
<br>
  'You lately recommended to your Female Readers, the good old Custom of
  their Grandmothers, who used to lay out a great Part of their Time in
  Needle-work: I entirely agree with you in your Sentiments, and think
  it would not be of less Advantage to themselves, and their Posterity,
  than to the Reputation of many of their good Neighbours, if they past
  many of those Hours in this innocent Entertainment, which are lost at
  the Tea-Table. I would, however, humbly offer to your Consideration,
  the Case of the Poetical Ladies; who, though they may be willing to
  take any Advice given them by the SPECTATOR, yet can't so easily quit
  their Pen and Ink, as you may imagine. Pray allow them, at least now
  and then, to indulge themselves in other Amusements of Fancy, when
  they are tired with stooping to their Tapestry. There is a very
  particular kind of Work, which of late several Ladies here in our
  Kingdom are very fond of, which seems very well adapted to a Poetical
  Genius: It is the making of <i>Grotto's.</i> I know a Lady who has a very
  Beautiful one, composed by her self, nor is there one Shell in it not
  stuck up by her own Hands. I here send you a Poem to the fair
  Architect, which I would not offer to herself, till I knew whether
  this Method of a Lady's passing her Time were approved of by the
  <i>British</i> SPECTATOR, which, with the Poem, I submit to your Censure,
  who am,<br>
<br>
  <i>Your Constant Reader, and Humble Servant</i>, <br>
A. B.

So well proportion'd, and dispos'd so well,<br>
Surprizing Lustre from thy Thought receive,<br>
Assuming Beauties more than Nature gave.<br>
To Her their various Shapes, and glossy Hue,<br>

Nor richer Colours paint the heav'nly Bow.<br><br>

Where can unpolished Nature boast a Piece,<br>
In all her Mossie Cells exact as This?<br>
At the gay parti-color'd Scene&mdash;we start,<br>
For Chance too regular, too rude for Art,<br><br>

The following Discourse is printed, as it came to my Hands, without
Variation.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

<blockquote> <i> Cambridge, Dec.</i> 12.<br>
<br>
  'It was a very common Enquiry among the Ancients why the Number of
  excellent Orators, under all the Encouragements the most flourishing
  States could give them, fell so far short of the Number of those who
  excelled in all other Sciences. A Friend of mine used merrily to apply
  to this Case an Observation of <i>Herodotus</i>, who says, That the most
  useful Animals are the most fruitful in their Generation; whereas the
  Species of those Beasts that are fierce and mischievous to Mankind are
  but scarcely continued. The Historian instances in a Hare, which
  always either breeds or brings forth; and a Lioness, which brings
  forth but once, and then loses all Power of Conception. But, leaving
  my Friend to his Mirth, I am of Opinion, that in these latter Ages we
  have greater Cause of Complaint than the Ancients had. And since that
  solemn Festival is approaching, which calls for all the Power of
  Oratory, and which affords as noble a Subject for the Pulpit as any
  Revelation has taught us, the Design of this Paper shall be to show,
  that our Moderns have greater Advantages towards true and solid
  Eloquence, than any which the celebrated Speakers of Antiquity
  enjoy'd.<br>
<br>
  'The first great and substantial Difference is, that their
  Common-Places, in which almost the whole Force of Amplification
  consists, were drawn from the Profit or Honesty of the Action, as they
  regarded only this present State of Duration. But Christianity, as it
  exalts Morality to a greater Perfection, as it brings the
  Consideration of another Life into the Question, as it proposes
  Rewards and Punishments of a higher Nature, and a longer Continuance,
  is more adapted to affect the Minds of the Audience, naturally
  inclined to pursue what it imagines its greatest Interest and Concern.
  If <i>Pericles</i>, as Historians report, could shake the firmest
  Resolutions of his Hearers, and set the Passions of all <i>Greece</i> in a
  Ferment, when the present Welfare of his Country, or the Fear of
  hostile Invasions, was the Subject: What may be expected from that
  Orator, who warns his Audience against those Evils which have no
  Remedy, when once undergone, either from Prudence or Time? As much
  greater as the Evils in a future State are than these at present, so
  much are the Motives to Persuasion under Christianity greater than
  those which meer moral Considerations could supply us with. But what I
  now mention relates only to the Power of moving the Affections. There
  is another Part of Eloquence, which is indeed its Master-piece; I mean
  the Marvellous or Sublime. In this the Christian Orator has the
  Advantage beyond Contradiction. Our Ideas are so infinitely enlarged
  by Revelation, the Eye of Reason has so wide a Prospect into Eternity,
  the Notions of a Deity are so worthy and refined, and the Accounts we
  have of a State of Happiness or Misery so clear and evident, that the
  Contemplation of such Objects will give our Discourse a noble Vigour,
  an invincible Force, beyond the Power of any human Consideration.
  <i>Tully</i> requires in his Perfect Orator some Skill in the Nature of
  Heavenly Bodies, because, says he, his Mind will become more extensive
  and unconfined; and when he descends to treat of human Affairs, he
  will both think and write in a more exalted and magnificent Manner.
  For the same Reason that excellent Master would have recommended the
  Study of those great and glorious Mysteries which Revelation has
  discovered to us; to which the noblest Parts of this System of the
  World are as much inferiour, as the Creature is less excellent than
  its Creator. The wisest and most knowing among the Heathens had very
  poor and imperfect Notions of a future State. They had indeed some
  uncertain Hopes, either received by Tradition, or, gathered by Reason,
  that the Existence of virtuous Men would not be determined by the
  Separation of Soul and Body: But they either disbelieved a future
  State of Punishment and Misery, or upon the same Account that
  <i>Apelles</i> painted <i>Antigonus</i> with one Side only towards the
  Spectator, that the Loss of his Eye might not cast a Blemish upon the
  whole Piece; so these represented the Condition of Man in its fairest
  View, and endeavoured to conceal what they thought was a Deformity to
  human Nature. I have often observed, that whenever the abovementioned
  Orator in his Philosophical Discourses is led by his Argument to the
  Mention of Immortality, he seems like one awaked out of Sleep, rous'd
  and alarm'd with the Dignity of the Subject, he stretches his
  Imagination to conceive something uncommon, and with the greatness of
  his Thoughts, casts, as it were, a Glory round the Sentence; Uncertain
  and unsettled as he was, he seems fired with the Contemplation of it.
  And nothing but such a Glorious Prospect could have forced so great a
  Lover of Truth, as he was, to declare his Resolution never to part
  with his Persuasion of Immortality, though it should be proved to be
  an erroneous one. But had he lived to see all that Christianity has
  brought to Light, how would he have lavished out all the Force of
  Eloquence in those noblest Contemplations which humane Nature is
  capable of, the Resurrection and the Judgment that follows it? How had
  his Breast glowed with Pleasure, when the whole Compass of Futurity
  lay open and exposed to his View? How would his Imagination have
  hurried him on in the Pursuit of the Mysteries of the Incarnation? How
  would he have enter'd, with the Force of Lightning, into the
  Affections of his Hearers, and fixed their Attention, in spite of all
  the Opposition of corrupt Nature, upon those glorious Themes which his
  Eloquence hath painted in such lively and lasting Colours?<br>
<br>
  'This Advantage Christians have; and it was with no small Pleasure I
  lately met with a Fragment of <i>Longinus</i>, which is preserv'd, as a
  Testimony of that Critick's Judgment, at the Beginning of a Manuscript
  of the New Testament in the <i>Vatican</i> Library. After that Author has
  number'd up the most celebrated Orators among the <i>Grecians</i>, he says,
  <i>Add to these</i> Paul <i>of</i> Tarsus, <i>the Patron of an Opinion not yet
  fully proved</i>. As a Heathen, he condemns the Christian Religion; and,
  as an impartial Critick, he judges in Favour of the Promoter and
  Preacher of it. To me it seems, that the latter Part of his Judgment
  adds great Weight to his Opinion of St. <i>Paul's</i> Abilities, since,
  under all the Prejudice of Opinions directly opposite, he is
  constrained to acknowledge the Merit of that Apostle. And, no doubt,
  such as <i>Longinus</i> describes St. <i>Paul</i>, such he appeared to the
  Inhabitants of those Countries which he visited and blessed with those
  Doctrines was divinely commissioned to preach. Sacred Story gives us,
  in one Circumstance, a convincing Proof of his Eloquence, when the Men
  of <i>Lystra</i> called him <i>Mercury, because he was the chief Speaker</i>,
  and would have paid Divine Worship to him, as to the God who invented
  and presided over Eloquence. This one Account of our Apostle sets his
  Character, consider'd as an Orator only, above all the celebrated
  Relations of the Skill and Influence of <i>Demosthenes</i> and his
  Contemporaries. Their Power in Speaking was admired, but still it was
  thought human: Their Eloquence warmed and ravished the Hearers, but
  still it was thought the Voice of Man, not the Voice of God. What
  Advantage then had St. <i>Paul</i> above those of <i>Greece</i>, or <i>Rome</i>? I
  confess I can ascribe this Excellence to nothing but the Power of the
  Doctrines he delivered, which may have still the same Influence on the
  Hearers; which have still the Power, when preached by a skilful
  Orator, to make us break out in the same Expressions, as the Disciples
  who met our Saviour in their Way to <i>Emmaus</i>, made use of; <i>Did not
  our Hearts burn within us, when he talked to us by the Way, and while
  he opened to us the Scriptures</i>? I may be thought bold in my Judgment
  by some; but I must affirm, That no one Orator has left us so visible
  Marks and Footsteps of his Eloquence as our Apostle. It may perhaps be
  wondered at, that in his Reasonings upon Idolatry at <i>Athens</i>, where
  Eloquence was born and flourished, he confines himself to strict
  Argument only; but my Reader may remember what many Authors of the
  best Credit have assured us, That all Attempts upon the Affections and
  Strokes of Oratory were expressly forbidden, by the Laws of that
  Country, in Courts of Judicature. His want of Eloquence therefore
  here, was the Effect of his exact Conformity to the Laws. But his
  Discourse on the Resurrection to the <i>Corinthians</i>, his Harangue
  before <i>Agrippa</i> upon his own Conversion and the Necessity of that of
  others, are truly Great, and may serve as full Examples to those
  excellent Rules for the Sublime, which the best of Criticks has left
  us. The Sum of all this Discourse is, That our Clergy have no farther
  to look for an Example of the Perfection they may arrive at, than to
  St. <i>Paul</i>'s Harangues; that when he, under the Want of several
  Advantages of Nature (as he himself tells us) was heard, admired, and
  made a Standard to succeeding Ages by the best Judge of a different
  Persuasion in Religion, I say our Clergy may learn, That, however
  instructive their Sermons are, they are capable of receiving a great
  Addition; which St. <i>Paul</i> has given them a noble Example of, and the
  Christian Religion has furnished them with certain Means of attaining
  to.'</blockquote><br>

<br>

It was the common Boast of the Heathen Philosophers, that by the
Efficacy of their several Doctrines, they made Humane Nature resemble
the Divine. How much mistaken soever they might be in the several Means
they proposed for this End, it must be owned that the Design was great
and glorious. The finest Works of Invention and Imagination are of very
little Weight, when put in the Balance with what refines and exalts the
rational Mind. <i>Longinus</i> excuses <i>Homer</i> very handsomely, when he says
the Poet made his Gods like Men, that he might make his Men appear like
the Gods: But it must be allowed that several of the ancient
Philosophers acted, as <i>Cicero</i> wishes <i>Homer</i> had done; they
endeavoured rather to make Men like Gods, than Gods like Men.<br>
<br>
According to this general Maxim in Philosophy, some of them have
endeavoured to place Men in such a State of Pleasure, or Indolence at
least, as they vainly imagined the Happiness of the Supreme Being to
consist in. On the other Hand, the most virtuous Sect of Philosophers
have created a chimerical wise Man, whom they made exempt from Passion
and Pain, and thought it enough to pronounce him All-sufficient.<br>
<br>
This last Character, when divested of the Glare of Humane Philosophy
that surrounds it, signifies no more, than that a Good and Wise Man
should so arm himself with Patience, as not to yield tamely to the
Violence of Passion and Pain; that he should learn so to suppress and
contract his De<b>Sir</b> es as to have few Wants; and that he should cherish so
many Virtues in his Soul, as to have a perpetual Source of Pleasure in
himself.<br>
<br>
The Christian Religion requires, that, after having framed the best
Idea, we are able, of the Divine Nature, it should be our next Care to
conform our selves to it, as far as our Imperfections will permit. I
might mention several Passages in the sacred Writings on this Head, to
which I might add many Maxims and wise Sayings of Moral Authors among
the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i>.<br>
<br>
I shall only instance a remarkable Passage, to this Purpose, out of
<i>Julian's C&aelig;sars</i>. The Emperor having represented all the <i>Roman</i>
Emperors, with <i>Alexander</i> the Great, as passing in Review before the
Gods, and striving for the Superiority, lets them all drop, excepting
<i>Alexander</i>, <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>, <i>Augustus C&aelig;sar</i>, <i>Trajan</i>, <i>Marcus
Aurelius</i>, and <i>Constantine</i>. Each of these great Heroes of Antiquity
lays in his Claim for the upper Place; and, in Order to it, sets forth
his Actions after the most advantageous Manner. But the Gods, instead of
being dazzled with the Lustre of their Actions, enquire, by <i>Mercury</i>,
into the proper Motive and governing Principle that influenced them
throughout the whole Series of their Lives and Exploits. <i>Alexander</i>
tells them, That his Aim was to conquer: <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>, that his was to
gain the highest Post in his Country; <i>Augustus</i>, To govern well;
<i>Trajan</i>, That His was the same as that of <i>Alexander</i>, namely, To
conquer. The Question, at length, was put to <i>Marcus Aurelius</i>, who
replied, with great Modesty, That <i>it had always been his Care to
imitate the Gods</i>. This Conduct seems to have gained him the most Votes
and best Place in the whole Assembly. <i>Marcus Aurelius</i> being afterwards
asked to explain himself declares, That, by imitating the Gods, he
endeavoured to imitate them in the Use of his Understanding, and of all
other Faculties; and, in particular, That it was always his Study to
have as few Wants as possible in himself, and to do all the Good he
could to others.<br>
<br>
Among the many Methods by which Revealed Religion has advanced Morality,
this is one, That it has given us a more just and perfect Idea of that
Being whom every reasonable Creature ought to imitate. The young Man, in
a Heathen Comedy, might justify his Lewdness by the Example of
<i>Jupiter</i>; as, indeed, there was scarce any Crime that might not be
countenanced by those Notions of the Deity which prevailed among the
common People in the Heathen World. Revealed Religion sets forth a
proper Object for Imitation, in that Being who is the Pattern, as well
as the Source, of all spiritual Perfection.<br>
<br>
While we remain in this Life, we are subject to innumerable Temptations,
which, if listen'd to, will make us deviate from Reason and Goodness,
the only Things wherein we can imitate the Supreme Being. In the next
Life we meet with nothing to excite our Inclinations that doth not
deserve them. I shall therefore dismiss my Reader with this Maxim, viz.
<i>Our Happiness in this World proceeds from the Suppression of our
De<b>Sir</b> es, but in the next World from the Gratification of them.</i><br>

  contemnito.</i><a href="transindex.html#635t"><img src="images/qmark.png" width="15" height="15" align="right" alt="translation"></a><br>
<br>
Cicero <i>Somn. Scip.</i></blockquote><br>
<br>

The following Essay comes from the ingenious Author of the Letter upon
<i>Novelty</i>, printed in a late <i>Spectator:</i> The Notions are drawn from the
<i>Platonick</i> way of Thinking, but as they contribute to raise the Mind,
and may inspire noble Sentiments of our own future Grandeur and
Happiness, I think it well deserves to be presented to the Publick.<br>
<br>
If the Universe be the Creature of an intelligent Mind, this Mind could
have no immediate Regard to himself in producing it. He needed not to
make Tryal of his Omnipotence, to be informed what Effects were within
its Reach: The World as existing in his eternal Idea was then as
beautiful as now it is drawn forth into Being; and in the immense Abyss
of his Essence are contained far brighter Scenes than will be ever set
forth to View; it being impossible that the great Author of Nature
should bound his own Power by giving Existence to a System of Creatures
so perfect that he cannot improve upon it by any other Exertions of his
Almighty Will. Between Finite and Infinite there is an unmeasured
Interval, not to be filled up in endless Ages; for which Reason, the
most excellent of all God's Works must be equally short of what his
Power is able to produce as the most imperfect, and may be exceeded with
the same Ease.<br>
<br>
This Thought hath made some imagine, (what, it must be confest, is not
impossible) that the unfathomed Space is ever teeming with new Births,
the younger still inheriting a greater Perfection than the elder. But as
this doth not fall within my present View, I shall content my self with
taking Notice, that the Consideration now mentioned proves undeniably,
that the Ideal Worlds in the Divine Understanding yield a Prospect
incomparably more ample, various and delightful than any Created World
can do: And that therefore as it is not to be supposed that God should
make a World merely of inanimate Matter, however diversified; or
inhabited only by Creatures of no higher an Order than Brutes; so the
End for which he designed his reasonable Offspring is the Contemplation
of his Works, the Enjoyment of himself, and in both to be happy, having,
to this Purpose, endowed them with correspondent Faculties and De<b>Sir</b> es.
He can have no greater Pleasure from a bare Review of his Works, than
from the Survey of his own Ideas, but we may be assured that he is well
pleased in the Satisfaction derived to Beings capable of it, and, for
whose Entertainment, he hath erected this immense Theatre. Is not this
more than an Intimation of our Immortality? Man, who when considered as
on his Probation for a happy Existence hereafter is the most remarkable
Instance of Divine Wisdom; if we cut him off from all Relation to
Eternity, is the most wonderful and unaccountable Composition in the
whole Creation. He hath Capacities to lodge a much greater Variety of
Knowledge than he will be ever Master of, and an unsatisfied Curiosity
to tread the secret Paths of Nature and Providence: But, with this, his
Organs, in their present Structure, are rather fitted to serve the
Necessities of a vile Body, than to minister to his Understanding; and
from the little Spot to which he is chained, he can frame but wandering
Guesses concerning the innumerable Worlds of Light that encompass him,
which, tho' in themselves of a prodigious Bigness, do but just glimmer
in the remote Spaces of the Heavens; and, when with a great deal of Time
and Pains he hath laboured a little way up the steep Ascent of Truth,
and beholds with Pity the groveling Multitude beneath, in a Moment, his
Foot slides, and he tumbles down headlong into the Grave.<br>
<br>
Thinking on this, I am obliged to believe, in Justice to the Creator of
the World, that there is another State when Man shall be better situated
for Contemplation, or rather have it in his Power to remove from Object
to Object, and from World to World; and be accommodated with Senses, and
other Helps, for making the quickest and most amazing Discoveries. How
doth such a Genius as <b>Sir</b>  <i>Isaac Newton,</i> from amidst the Darkness that
involves human Understanding, break forth, and appear like one of
another Species! The vast Machine, we inhabit, lyes open to him, he
seems not unacquainted with the general Laws that govern it; and while
with the Transport of a Philosopher he beholds and admires the glorious
Work, he is capable of paying at once a more devout and more rational
Homage to his Maker. But alas! how narrow is the Prospect even of such a
Mind? and how obscure to the Compass that is taken in by the Ken of an
Angel; or of a Soul but newly escaped from its Imprisonment in the Body!
For my Part, I freely indulge my Soul in the Confidence of its future
Grandeur; it pleases me to think that I who know so small a portion of
the Works of the Creator, and with slow and painful Steps creep up and
down on the Surface of this Globe, shall e'er long shoot away with the
Swiftness of Imagination, trace out the hidden Springs of Nature's
Operations, be able to keep pace with the heavenly Bodies in the
Rapidity of their Career, be a <b>Spectator</b> of the long Chain of Events in
the natural and Moral Worlds, visit the several Apartments of the
Creation, know how they are furnished and how inhabited, comprehend the
Order, and measure the Magnitudes, and Distances of those Orbs, which to
us seem disposed without any regular Design, and set all in the same
Circle; observe the Dependance of the Parts of each System, and (if our
Minds are big enough to grasp the Theory) of the several Systems upon
one another, from whence results the Harmony of the Universe. In
Eternity a great deal may be done of this kind. I find it of use to
cherish this generous Ambition: for besides the secret Refreshment it
diffuses through my Soul, it engages me in an Endeavour to improve my
Faculties, as well as to exercise them conformably to the Rank I now
hold among reasonable Beings, and the Hope I have of being once advanced
to a more exalted Station.<br>
<br>
The other, and that the Ultimate End of Man, is the Enjoyment of God,
beyond which he cannot form a Wish. Dim at best are the Conceptions we
have of the Supreme Being, who, as it were, keeps his Creatures in
Suspence, neither discovering, nor hiding himself; by which Means, the
Libertine hath a Handle to dispute his Existence, while the most are
content to speak him fair, but in their Hearts prefer every trifling
Satisfaction to the Favour of their Maker, and ridicule the good Man for
the Singularity of his Choice. Will there not a Time come, when the
Free-thinker shall see his impious Schemes overturned, and be made a
Convert to the Truths he hates; when deluded Mortals shall be convinced
of the Folly of their Pursuits, and the few Wise who followed the
Guidance of Heaven, and, scorning the Blandishments of Sense and the
sordid Bribery of the World, aspired to a celestial Abode, shall stand
possessed of their utmost Wish in the Vision of the Creator? Here the
Mind heaves a Thought now and then towards him, and hath some transient
Glances of his Presence: When, in the Instant it thinks it self to have
the fastest hold, the Object eludes its Expectations, and it falls back
tired and baffled to the Ground. Doubtless there is some more perfect
way of conversing with heavenly Beings. Are not Spirits capable of
Mutual Intelligence, unless immersed in Bodies, or by their
Intervention? Must superior Natures depend on inferior for the main
Privilege of sociable Beings, that of conversing with, and knowing each
other? What would they have done, had Matter never been created? I
suppose, not have lived in eternal Solitude. As incorporeal Substances
are of a nobler Order, so be sure, their manner of Intercourse is
answerably more expedite and intimate. This method of Communication, we
call Intellectual Vision, as somewhat Analogous to the Sense of Seeing,
which is the Medium of our Acquaintance with this visible World. And in
some such way can God make himself the Object of immediate Intuition to
the Blessed; and as he can, 'tis not improbable that he will, always
condescending, in the Circumstances of doing it, to the Weakness and
Proportion of finite Minds. His Works but faintly reflect the Image of
his Perfections, 'tis a Second-hand Knowledge: To have a just Idea of
him, it may be necessary that we see him as he is. But what is that?
'Tis something, that never entered into the Heart of Man to conceive;
yet what we can easily conceive, will be a Fountain of Unspeakable, of
Everlasting Rapture. All created Glories will fade and die away in his
Presence. Perhaps it will be my Happiness to compare the World with the
fair Exemplar of it in the Divine Mind; perhaps, to view the original
Plan of those wise Designs that have been executing in a long Succession
of Ages. Thus employed in finding out his Works, and contemplating their
Author! how shall I fall prostrate and adoring, my Body swallowed up in
the Immensity of Matter, my Mind in the Infinitude of his Perfections.<br>
